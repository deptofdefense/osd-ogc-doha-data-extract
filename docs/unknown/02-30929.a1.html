  There is no general requirement for an Administrative Judge to discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  The Board does not have to agree with the Judge's reasoning or analysis in this case to conclude that Department Counsel has failed to make a persuasive argument that the Judge impermissibly  shifted the burden of persuasion away from Applicant.  Because of the limits of the Board's authority under the Directive and because there is no presumption  of error below, (a) a Judge's unchallenged findings and conclusions will be allowed to stand, and (b) a Judge's challenged findings and conclusions will be  allowed to stand if the appealing party fails to demonstrate error below.  Favorable decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 14, 2003 which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B  (Foreign Influence).  
Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued a favorable security clearance decision dated June 30, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to discuss the significance of a particular document; and 
(2) whether the Administrative Judge improperly relieved Applicant of the burden of showing that his family does not pose a security risk, and erroneously 
concluded Applicant met his burden of presenting evidence supportive of a favorable security clearance decision.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-30929.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to discuss the significance of a particular document</SPAN>.  At the hearing, Department Counsel asked the 
Administrative Judge to take  official notice of an annual report to Congress.  Applicant did not object, and the Judge indicated that she would take official 
notice of the annual report.  On appeal, Department Counsel asserts the Judge failed to  address the significance of that document.</P> 
 
<P>There is no general legal requirement for a Judge to discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0730 (October 21, 1998) at 
p. 3.  While it probably would have been helpful for the Judge to discuss the report to Congress beyond giving a brief reference to it in her decision, the Board 
declines to hold that, as a matter of law, the Judge was required to do so under the particular facts and circumstances of this case.  <EM>Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 98-0809 
(August 19, 1999) at p. 2 (noting that Hearing Office Administrative Judges have broad latitude and discretion in writing their decisions).</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge improperly relieved Applicant of the burden of showing that his family does not pose a security risk, and erroneously 
concluded Applicant met his burden of presenting evidence supportive of a favorable security clearance decision</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the 
Administrative Judge's decision "attempts to relieve the Applicant of the burden to show that his family does not pose a security risk."  Department Counsel 
also makes several arguments that the Board construes as raising the contention that the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant met his burden of 
presenting evidence supportive of a favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is correct that an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in these cases.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item, 
E3.1.15.  However, the Board does not have to agree with the Administrative Judge's reasoning or analysis in this case to conclude that Department Counsel 
has failed to make a persuasive argument that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion away from Applicant in this case.</P> 
 
<P>Central to Department Counsel's arguments is the claim that the Administrative Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for her conclusion that Foreign 
Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-30929.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> can be applied to Applicant's two brothers.  The Board does not have to agree with the Administrative Judge's application 
of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 to conclude that Department Counsel has failed to make a persuasive argument that the Judge improperly applied 
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 in this case.<A HREF="02-30929.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>Because of the limits of the Board's authority under the Directive,<A HREF="02-30929.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P> and because there is no presumption of error below: (a) an Administrative Judge's 
unchallenged findings  and conclusions will be allowed to stand; and (b) a Judge's challenged findings and conclusions will be allowed to stand if the appealing 
party fails to demonstrate error below.  <EM>Cf.</EM>  ISCR Case No. 01-22606 (June 30, 2003) at p. 4 (in discussing the precedential value of decisions by Hearing 
Office Administrative Judges, the Board noted various circumstances under which it has affirmed decisions below despite the existence of fact or legal error by 
the Judges).  In this case, Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate error below, and therefore the Judge's decision is allowed to stand.</P>

<P>Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Administrative Judge's decision is affirmed.</P>
