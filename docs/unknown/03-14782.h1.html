<P>Applicant, a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor, mitigated sexual behavior and criminal conduct allegations since all occurred between 25 and 35 
years ago. The oldest was an arrest while a juvenile. He has shown rehabilitation since the latest arrest and conviction in 1980. He failed to mitigate personal 
conduct security concerns be failing to report the two earliest arrests which were  felonies at Question 21on his SF 86. Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 31, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On June 21, 2005, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to 
me on March 14, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on April 26, 2006. A hearing was held on May 3, 2006. The Government introduced four exhibits and 
Applicant introduced six, and all were admitted into evidence. Applicant and a security investigator testified. The transcript was received May 11, 2006.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 52-year-old employee since 1979 of a major defense contractor. He has been employed there since 1979 and works as a materials handler. He has 
held a security clearance for the past twelve years. The SOR alleged sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns. After a 
complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following findings of fact are made:</P> 
 
<P>A review of the allegations in the SOR and the testimony thereon leads to the following findings as to each:</P> 
 
<P>1. Sexual Conduct</P> 
 
<P>a. When Applicant was 16 years old he engaged in a sexual act with a four-year-old boy who was in the care of Applicant's mother. He was arrested November 
10, 1971, and charged with felony child molestation but was not prosecuted. He received counseling under court supervision and such conduct has not recurred. 
He denied the date of the offense but not the substance of the charge. The SOR was amended to reflect the correct date. </P> 
 
<P>b. On December 24, 1975, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony abduction based on transporting minor females across state lines for the purpose of 
having sexual relations. He and a friend picked up two minor females in his friend's car in one state and drove into another state. He was not driving, fell 
asleep, and when he awakened he was in another state. They all slept awhile in the car and returned to the point of origin. He was not prosecuted and did not 
have sexual relations with the females. </P> 
 
<P>When Applicant was questioned in his interview as to whether he had ever had sexual relations with minor females he answered that he had done so several 
times. This was based on the fact that he has been married three times and the first two marriages were with females who were under 18 at the time of the 
marriage and not on the basis of the 1975 incident and arrest. He denied the allegation insofar as the sexual relations part of the allegation which may have been 
a standard Mann Act charge. </P> 
 
<P>2. Criminal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>a. On August 23, 1980, Applicant was arrested for stealing and sentenced to pay restitution and court costs totaling $7, 420.00 and serve five years probation. 
The case arose because Applicant owned an automobile for which he owed payments on an auto loan. He believed the car was defective and asked a friend to 
get rid of it for him. The friend destroyed the car by burning it. This matter was reported to the authorities and resulted in Applicant's arrest and the payment of 
restitution to the creditor. He served his probation without incident. </P> 
 
<P>b. The SOR alleged he was arrested on August 9, 1976, and charged as a fugitive. Applicant denied the allegation and there was no evidence offered of the 
offense. </P> 
 
<P>c. The SOR alleged he was arrested for disturbing the peace on July 21, 1976, after an argument with his father. He admitted the incident and the arrest but no 
charges were filed. </P> 
 
<P>d. The SOR alleged he was arrested for DUI on March 1, 1976. He denied it and no evidence was introduced to establish the allegation. </P> 
 
<P>e. This allegation is dated the same as SOR 1.b. and includes several of the above allegations but includes only one new one, an arrest for a robbery in his 
neighborhood, but not on the date alleged. He admitted the arrest, offered explanation for the police mistake in arresting him, and was never prosecuted. </P> 
 
<P>3. Personal Conduct </P> 
 
<P>a. Applicant answered in the negative on Question 21 of his SF 86 relating to ever having been charged with or convicted of a felony. Only the two offenses 
under SOR 1 were alleged to have been omitted. In his statement to the investigator he stated that he omitted reference to them for fear that to do so would 
jeopardize his security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>b. Applicant stated in his signed statement to the security investigator that he could be blackmailed if anyone found out about the arrest as a juvenile for the 
sexual incident alleged in 1.a. </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing he denied having said that he could be blackmailed and only included it in the statement because the investigator suggested it. </P> 
 
<P>c. Applicant admitted in his security interview and statement that he withheld information about 1.a. and b. in his application for employment. No other 
evidence was offered. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant married his third wife in 1988 but has been separated since 1996. They have two sons aged 13 and 15 for whom they have shared custody. She has 
custody during the school year but he has custody for weekends and in the summer months. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is well regarded in his employment and has received numerous commendation and awards during his employment (Exhs. A, D-F, and I). For the past 
26 years he has worked as a volunteer fireman in his community receiving numerous recognition awards (Exh. B, C, and H). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security 
clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 
3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Under Guideline D of the Directive sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, and may subject the individual to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress (E2.A4.1.1.). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include engaging in sexual behavior of a criminal 
nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted (E2.A4.1.2.1)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN> Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government 
has established reasons to deny him a security clearance based on sexual behavior. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish 
security suitability through evidence that refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualifying conditions and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant a security clearance. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions might include that the behavior occurred during or prior to adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature 
(E2.A4.1.3.1.), the behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature (E2.A4.1.3.2.). The two allegations relating to 
sexual behavior occurred respectively 35 and 31 years ago. The most egregious and oldest offense was when Applicant was a juvenile. He received counseling 
and there have been no further similar incidents involving minors.</SPAN> The mitigating conditions are applicable. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, </SPAN>Criminal Conduct, a security concern arises when there is a history of pattern of criminal activity that creates doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness (E2.A10.1.1.). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.), or a single serious offense (molesting a child) or 
multiple lesser offenses (E2.A10.1.2.2.). </P> 
 
<P>The allegations could be mitigated if the criminal behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1), or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). 
Applicant attended counseling for the first sexual behavior allegation. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The most recent criminal conduct was causing the destruction of his automobile to 
defraud a creditor. It resulted in probation for five years and restitution of the value of the automobile. All of the other incidents either did not happen or were 
30 years ago. </SPAN>Mitigating conditions are applicable because of the age of the incidents and that no criminal conduct has occurred in over 25 years showing 
rehabilitation through passage of time, his work record, and public service. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct actions involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). The Government has established by evidence and 
Applicant's admissions that he has been involved in a pattern of rule violations (E2.A5.1.2.5.). The deliberate failure to give complete and accurate information 
on his SF 86 (E2.A5.1.2.2.) is sufficient to establish reasons to deny a security clearance based on personal conduct. As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted 
to the Applicant to show that Mitigating Conditions (MC) are applicable to him. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's statement to the investigator that he feared loss of his security clearance and that he could be blackmailed indicates a motive for the falsification. In 
view of the nature of the allegation and the outcome, the 1975 offense likely would not have led to either loss of his clearance or blackmail. The 197l offense 
during Applicant's minority years would not, as the investigator testified at the hearing, have been available to the public and was available to him only because 
he is a law enforcement agent and the waiver to obtain records that all security clearance to which applicants for security clearances must agree. Thus, while his 
fear likely was misplaced, he apparently had such concerns thus showing a deliberate attempt to withhold information to which the government had a right to 
receive. His changed views on both matters at the hearing deserves little credibility. As to his application for company employment, no evidence was offered to 
show that his company required him to report either a juvenile offense or an arrest without conviction.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified 
information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its 
own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant has had a good record for the past 25 years and shows support for his children and dedication to his employment and volunteer work, his 
admitted effort to deceive by the omission of his felony arrests does not speak well for application of the whole person doctrine to this matter. </P> 
 
<P>After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that he is not eligible for 
access to classified information. Thus, I find against the Applicant. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance
