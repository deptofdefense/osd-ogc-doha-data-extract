<P>Applicant had four alcohol-related driving incidents between 1993 and 1998, but only listed the latest incident in his security clearance application.  Applicant 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.  Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns 
raised by his deliberate omissions from his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 29 September 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-09220.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 8 October 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 22 January 2004.  On 22 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 30 March 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a 30-year-old senior graphics designer for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1, 3.  He is respected by his supervisor as an excellent worker who 
consistently provides "top-notch quality work."  Ex. B.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant started consuming alcoholic beverages at the age of 16.  In college, he drank to the point of intoxication three or four times a week.  After college, he 
usually limited his drinking to Fridays and Saturdays.  He normally consumed three to five beers on these occasions, which he believes did not make him drunk.  
On special occasions he would also drink four or five shots of hard liquor.  Ex. 2 at 6-7.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was arrested in State 1 on 2 April 1993 for driving under the influence (DUI).  Ex. 3 at 1.  Applicant was given two breath tests--one registered .20 
and the other .19.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.  On 3 May 1993, he pled guilty to the offense, was fined, and ordered to complete DWI (driving while intoxicated) school.  Answer.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was arrested in October 1994 in State 1 for criminal damage to property.  He was intoxicated at the time of the offense.  He was convicted of the 
offense and fined.  Answer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On 4 January 1997, Applicant consumed two beers and "a lot" of Southern Comfort while at a bachelor party.  He later went to a club where he consumed two 
mixed drinks.  Ex. 4 at 13.  Applicant was injured in an accident in State 2 while driving home in his auto.  A blood-alcohol test administered at the hospital 
registered .264 with a reading greater than .10 being a violation of state law.  Applicant pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced to one year of unsupervised 
probation, ordered to perform 48 hours of public service, fined, and ordered to have an alcohol evaluation performed.  Answer.  Applicant kept driving even 
though his license was suspended.  Ex. 2 at 6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was arrested in June 1997, in State 2, for operating a vehicle without insurance, driving while his license was under restraint, and changing lanes 
improperly.  In December 1997, Applicant pled guilty to driving while his license was under restraint.  He was sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended) and 
fined.  Answer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In August 1998, in State 2, Applicant was arrested for careless driving, failure to drive within marked lanes, failure to present proof of insurance, driving while 
his license was under restraint, DUI, and driving a vehicle with a blood alcohol content in excess of .10.  In March 1999, he pled guilty to DUI and was 
sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation, fined, and ordered to serve 96 hours of public service, 45 days of home detention, and have an alcohol 
evaluation conducted with a Level II alcohol education program.  Answer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In November 1998, Applicant was arrested in State 2 for failing to drive in a single lane, driving when his license was under restraint, DUI, and failing to 
present evidence of insurance.  The officer detected a moderate odor of alcohol coming from Applicant's breath and his eyes were bloodshot.  Applicant 
asserted that he had consumed only one beer some five hours earlier.  Applicant failed the field sobriety tests.  Applicant declined to take a chemical test to 
determine the level of alcohol in his blood because his license had already been revoked.  Applicant pled guilty to the reduced charges of driving while his 
ability was impaired (with a prior DUI), driving under suspension (alcohol related), and failing to produce evidence of insurance.  He was sentenced to one year 
of supervised probation, 60 days in home detention, fined, and ordered to perform community service, complete a level II alcohol education program, complete 
level II alcohol therapy, and take Antabuse.  Answer.  Applicant's license was suspended until 2004.  Ex. 2 at 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">After his last arrest in November 1998, Applicant finally realized he needed to cut back on his consumption of alcohol, and he did so.  He is now married, has a 
child, and does not consume alcoholic beverages very often.  He drinks one to three beers on the weekend.  Ex. 2 at 6-7.  Applicant had a substance abuse 
evaluation conducted in March 2003 by a certified addictions counselor.  The counselor administered three screening instruments and found Applicant's profile 
is consistent with individuals who do not have a high probability of having a substance abuse disorder or dependence, and that he was open and honest about 
his past and current use of alcohol.  Ex. 10 at 1.  The counselor found no evidence Applicant "has a current drinking problem that would effect (sic) his 
judgment."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on 26 January 2001.  Ex. 1.  Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or 
convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant answered yes and listed his conviction on 12 December 1999 for DUI.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 7.  No other 
offenses were listed.  Applicant failed to list his other offenses because he was afraid he "would lose his job if [his] past was exposed."  Answer; Tr. 39.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Question 26 of the SCA asked Applicant if, in the previous seven years, he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense not listed in other 
modules of the SCA.  Applicant answered "no."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of the following offenses:  DWI in May 1993 (&para; 1.a.), criminal damage to property for an arrest in October 
1994 (&para; 1.b.), DUI for an arrest in January 1997 (&para; 1.c.), driving while license was under restraint (&para; 1.d.), DUI in March 1999 for an arrest in August 1998 (&para; 
1.e.), and driving while ability impaired with prior DUI, driving under suspension, and no proof of insurance (&para; 1.f.).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity 
creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government established by Applicant's admissions the criminal conduct alleged in SOR &para; 1.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1; DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  But the criminal 
conduct was not recent--the last offense was some six years ago when he was 25 years old.  MC E2.A10.1.3.1.  All of Applicant's alleged criminal offenses 
were alcohol-related.  Although Applicant still consumes alcoholic beverages, he has curtailed his excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages and has not 
had a criminal incident since 1998.  There is clear evidence of rehabilitation.  MC E2.A10.1.3.6.  I find for Applicant on SOR &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by (1) failing to acknowledge all of his alcohol-related arrests and convictions in 
answer to question 24 (&para; 2.a.); and (2) failing to acknowledge his arrest and conviction for criminal damage to property in answer to question 26 (&para; 2.b.).  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in SOR &para; 2.  Applicant deliberately 
concealed relevant and material facts from his SCA by failing to fully disclose the extent of his alcohol-related offenses and his other offense of criminal 
damage to property.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Applicant claims he "did not know full disclosure was that important at the time" and "was scared [he] would lose [his] 
job if [his] past was exposed."  Answer.  This is not the first time Applicant failed to truthfully advise authorities of his past.  After his January 1997 arrest, he 
wrote to the court, and told a nurse who wrote the court on his behalf, that this was his first offense, when in fact it was his second.  Ex. 4 at 14, 16.  During a 
1999 alcohol evaluation, Applicant denied he had ever used illegal drugs.  Ex. 8 at 6.  Yet on his SCA he admitted using marijuana once in 1994.  <EM>See </EM>Ex. at 8.  
None of the listed mitigating conditions apply.  After considering all of the evidence, Applicant has not convinced me he is sufficiently trustworthy to be 
granted a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline G--Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from the age of 16 to the present (&para; 3.a.), was involved in the 
alcohol-related offenses set forth in &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f. (&para; 3.b.), and continues to consume alcohol on weekends (&para; 3.c.).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol 
consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in SOR &para; 3, except &para; 3.a.  Applicant has not 
admitted, and there is no other record evidence to support a conclusion, he still drinks to the point of intoxication.  The allegation in &para; 3.c. does not establish a 
disqualifying condition.  Just because Applicant has had problems with alcohol in the past does not mean that he has to abstain from consuming alcohol. There 
is no requirement that even an alcohol dependent applicant completely abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages.  ISCR Case No. 96-0869, 1997 DOHA 
LEXIS 665 *10 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 1997).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's numerous alcohol-related incidents away from work are disqualifying.  DC E2.A7.1.2.1.  Applicant was involved in binge consumption of alcohol 
to the point of impaired judgment (<EM>see </EM>Ex. 4 at 13).  DC E2.A7.1.2.5.  Consumption of alcohol subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism is a disqualifying 
condition.  DC E2.A7.1.2.6.  Although Applicant was diagnosed as a problem drinker, and his doctor found Applicant had "persistent elevated liver enzymes" 
and recommended "[h]e should not drink any alcohol," there has been no diagnosis of alcoholism or alcohol dependence.  Ex. 6 at 14.  In fact, Applicant had an 
alcohol assessment performed in March 2003 that states there is no evidence Applicant has a current drinking problem that would effect (sic) his judgment and 
discretion necessary to handle and protect classified defense information."  Ex. 10 at 2.  Applicant's alcohol problem occurred a number of years ago--the last 
incident was in 1998.  MC E2.A7.1.3.2.  And Applicant has made positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety.  MC E2.A7.1.3.3.  I find for 
Applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P>
