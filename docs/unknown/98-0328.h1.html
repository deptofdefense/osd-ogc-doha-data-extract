<P>On April 30, 1998, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons
(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 15, 1998, in which he elected to have the case determined on a
written record in lieu of a hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)
to the Applicant on July 16, 1998.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or
mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on August 28, 1998, and he submitted no response.</P>

<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on September 1, 1998. </P>

<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<P>The Applicant is 23 years old, unmarried and is employed by a defense contractor as a Laborer.  He is applying for a
Secret-level security clearance in connection with his employment.</P>

<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the
attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the
SOR:</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion J - Criminal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has engaged in a history of criminal conduct, including auto burglary, public intoxication, assault with a
dangerous weapon, and domestic violence.</P>

<P>The Applicant has admitted to a history of criminal conduct beginning as a juvenile, back in 1990, and continuing until as
recently as February 1998.  </P>

<P>The Applicant was first arrested on October 4, 1990, and charged with auto burglary, a felony in violation of the law in
the state in which it occurred.  The Applicant was referred to Juvenile Court and placed on probation.</P>

<P>The Applicant was arrested a second time on September 5, 1992.  He was charged with Challenging to Fight, and Drunk
in Public.  He was again referred to Juvenile Court.</P>

<P>The Applicant was arrested a third time on October 29, 1994, and charged with Aggravated Assault with a Dangerous
Weapon, and Disorderly Conduct.  The Applicant explains that he and his cousin were driving around when an individual,
with whom his cousin had an ongoing dispute, forced them to pull over.  The individual got out of his car, came over to
the driver's side of the car, and started hitting the Applicant's cousin with his fist.  The Applicant got out of the car, ran to
his house and picked up his .22 caliber automatic pistol.  The Applicant and his cousin then got back in the car, picked up
three other persons, and drove around until they spotted the individual who had beaten his cousin.  As the individual was
running toward their car, the Applicant fired the gun in the air through the window on his cousin's side of the vehicle.  The 
Applicant claims that he did not intend to shoot or kill the individual, as his .22 pistol was loaded with bird shot.  The
Applicant was found guilty of both charges.  He was sentenced to the state prison for eight years of hard labor, with six
years suspended, placed on probation for six years following incarceration, and fined $1,250.00 including costs for
Aggravated Assault with a Dangerous Weapon.  He was sentenced to ten days in jail and fined $100.00 for Disorderly
Conduct.  The Applicant served 30 days in state prison, and in February 1995, elected to spend the rest of his
rehabilitation in a boot camp program at a correctional training center.  The Applicant completed the boot camp program
in May 1995, and was transferred to a half way house where he worked until August 1995, when he was paroled.  The
Applicant will remain on supervised parole until 2002.  (See, Government Exhibit 4).</P>

<P>The Applicant was arrested on two occasions in December 1996.  On December 5, 1996, he was arrested and charged
with Criminal Mischief.  The police were summoned to the Applicant's residence on a domestic call because the
Applicant had trashed his and his girlfriend's apartment.  The Applicant was detained overnight, and the charges were
dismissed.  On December 15, 1996, the Applicant was arrested again for Criminal Mischief because he had kicked in his
apartment door.  The charges were subsequently dismissed.  (See, Government Exhibit 7). </P>

<P>On February 9, 1998, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Battery That Constitutes Domestic Violence, a
misdemeanor.  The incident started during a discussion about the Applicant moving out, and giving up his parental rights
to his son.  The Applicant became disturbed, threw a bowl of food at his girlfriend, and then put his hands around her neck
and stated, "I want to rip your neck off".  A fight ensued.  The Applicant was found guilty, and was sentenced to ten days
in jail, with credit for time already served.  Since this arrest, the Applicant has continued to live with his girlfriend to give
himself enough time to find a place of his own.  He and his girlfriend are considering relationship counseling to try to
reconcile their relationship.  (See, Government Exhibit 6).</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 2 (Criterion E - Personal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or an unwillingness to
comply with rules and regulations.</P>

<P>On January 4, 1998, the Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions which required him to
indicate whether in the last seven years, he has ever been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of, any offenses not
listed in response to a, b, c, d or e, above.  The Applicant responded "no."  (See, Government Exhibit 5, Question 23.f.) 
The Applicant stated that he had no intention of  concealing his past arrest history.  (See, Applicant's Answer to SOR).   I
note that the Applicant admitted his more serious aggravated assault, and firearm conviction on the application.  (See,
Applicant's Answer to Question 23.a, and b. on the Questionnaire for National Security Position).  I find that the
Applicant was not careful in filling out the application, but that he did  not deliberately omit, or intentionally conceal his
arrest history.  </P>

<P>The Applicant provided a signed sworn statement dated March 17, 1998, to the Defense Investigative Service wherein he
failed to mention  his arrests of  December  5, 1996, and December 15, 1996, although he mentions four other arrests. 
(See, Government Exhibit 8).  The Applicant explained that because the charges were dropped, he didn't think the
information was relevant.  (See, Applicant's Answer to SOR).</P>

<P><U>Mitigation.</U></P>

<P>The Applicant states that his experience in state prison and boot camp have benefitted him tremendously, and that he has
changed his life because of it.  He realizes the responsibility of raising a two year old son, and that his criminal behavior
of the past must cease.</P>

<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG><STRONG><U>POLICIES</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of  the
1992 Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case
according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on  own common sense.  Because each security
clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm
of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most
applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><U>Criterion J (Criminal Conduct)</U></P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>(1)  any criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>(2)  a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>None.</P>

<P><U>Criterion E (Personal Conduct)</U></P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern:</U></P>

<P>(2)  deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel
security questionnaire;</P>

<P>(3)  deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in
connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</U></P>

<P>None.</P>

<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's
conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</P>

<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DOD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are
reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly
consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P>

<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted
upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately
concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct,
which demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability.</P>

<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an
affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is
predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful
weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in
nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty
of the Applicant concerned."</P>

<P><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted
upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is
therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved
in criminal and dishonest conduct, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</P>

<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational
connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been
established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation
which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P>

<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by evidence that the Applicant has engaged in criminal
conduct (Criterion J).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the
Applicant.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>With respect to the Applicant's deliberate omission of material information concerning his complete arrest history on his
security clearance questionnaire, and in his sworn statement to the Defense Investigative Service, I find that it was not
intentional.  Accordingly, Criterion E (Personal Conduct), is found for the Applicant.</P>

<P>Where an Applicant engages in criminal conduct, it can be presumed that he or she will not take a serious attitude toward
the important matter of protecting classified information.  This Applicant has failed to introduced persuasive evidence in
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him. </P>

<P>The record evidence establishes that the Applicant has engaged in a pattern and history of criminal conduct starting about
eight years ago, and continuing until as recently as February of this year.  His criminal offenses are serious, recent, and
show immaturity and extreme poor judgment.  As a result of his 1994 felony conviction, the Applicant remains on parole
until 2002.    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> </FONT></P>

<P>The Applicant has also failed to respond to the File of Relevant Material, which leaves the record silent on the issue of
rehabilitation.  Although the Applicant shows some sensitivity to his past wrong behavior, it is not clear that the Applicant
has gained the necessary insight into the seriousness of his criminal conduct, or whether he is prepared to act responsibly
in the future.  I cannot say that he is unlikely to repeat his irresponsible conduct.  I find that the Applicant's criminal
conduct was not isolated, was recent, and could possibly recur in the future.  Accordingly, Criterion  Criterion J (Criminal
Conduct), is found against the Applicant.</P>

<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a
security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary
allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of
the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.a.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.b.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.c.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.d.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.e.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.f.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.g.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Paragraph 2: For the Applicant. </P>

<P>Subpara.  1.a.: For the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.b.: For the Applicant.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>DECISION</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
