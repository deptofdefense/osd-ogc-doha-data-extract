<P>    Applicant's conduct raises security concerns over his finances, alcohol abuse, personal conduct and criminal conduct.  He admitted filing for bankruptcy in 1987 which 
was discharged and again in 2000.  He claimed his debts were discharged in the 2000 filing but failed to  submit  any evidence of the discharge.  Further Applicant 
deliberately misled the Government by omissions from his security form. Thus, the Government has established a case of criminal falsification under 18 U.S.C. section 
1001 as he was clearly put on notice of that section of the criminal code to emphasize that he had a duty to reveal all adverse information on the SF 86.  Instead he 
improperly certified that his answers were "true, complete, and correct." On the other hand he has mitigated the isolated alcohol-related arrest.   Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 12, 2000.  The SOR detailed reasons why the 
Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.<A HREF="00-0501.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  (Item 1)  The SOR alleges specific concerns in paragraph 1 over financial issues (Guideline F), alcohol abuse (Guideline G), personal conduct (Guideline E) 
and criminal conduct (Guideline J).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on December 29, 2000, where he admitted paragraphs 1.a. 
though 1.f. but provided explanations; he admitted paragraph 2.a.; he admitted paragraphs 3.a. through 3.d.; and he admitted paragraph 4.a. through 4.c.  He requested a 
determination on the record.  (Item 3)</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel; on January 25, 2001, she prepared the File of Relevant Material (FORM) for the Applicant's review.  Department 
Counsel advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the 
right to be represented by counsel.  A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on January 26, 2001, and again notified the Applicant that he had 
30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the FORM on 
February 12,  2001.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, he did not submit any response before the deadline of March 14, 2001.  On May 7,  2001, the case was assigned to me.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>     </P> 
 
<P>Applicant who is a 45 years old has been an employee of a defense contractor in State #1 since December 1979.  He applied for a security clearance in June1999 by 
completing a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  He was divorced in April 1999; he has two children born in 1980 and 1985. (Item 4)  He 
reported no adverse information on his security clearance form. (Item 4) </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG> <STRONG>and Personal and Criminal Conduct </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>While his June 1999 security clearance application revealed no adverse financial issues, a December 1999 Report of Credit revealed several delinquencies.  (Item 9)  In 
arch 2000 Defense Security Service (DSS) interviewed Applicant who said that he decided to file for bankruptcy in February 2000 (SOR 1.b.) because of his 1999 
divorce which led to increased living expenses after he and his wife separated in September 1998.  There he disclosed net monthly take home pay of approximately 
$1,500 with approximately $1,500 in monthly expenses.  Debts to three of his creditors (Creditor #1, #2, #3 are included in the bankruptcy filing (SOR 1.c,. 1.d., and 
1.e), but he submitted no evidence that these debts have been discharged.  His debt to creditor #4 is not included in the filing; while he claimed it was also discharged, he 
submitted no evidence that it had been discharged.  (SOR 1.f.).   (Items 5, 6)   Further, he did not explain the circumstances that led to his (and his wife's) decision to file 
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 1986 where approximately $10,000 in unsecured debts were discharged in April 1987.  (SOR 1.a.)  In his Answer notarized on 
October 30, 2000, he admitted paragraphs 1.a. though 1.f., but explained that his debts had been discharged; however, he submitted no supportive documentation.   
Weighing all of this evidence, I conclude Applicant did intend to mislead the U.S. government by omitting this adverse financial information from his SF 86 as his financial 
issues arising from the divorce existed at the time, yet he knowingly and willfully failed to include that adverse information on his security form.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG> </SPAN><STRONG>and Personal and Criminal Conduct</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On the SF 86 in June1999 Applicant revealed no adverse information on alcohol abuse or arrests and certified that his statements on the form were "true, complete, and 
correct."  (Item 4)  However, he omitted his arrest of February 1999 where he was found guilty in April 1999 of Driving under the Influence (DUI) and placed on twelve 
months supervised probation and fined $6000 plus community service, ordered to enroll in DUI school; his probation was terminated early for successfully completing all 
the conditions of probation.  </P> 
 
<P>When he was interviewed by the DSS investigator in March 2000, Applicant excused his actions by saying he did not attempt to "hide anything."  However his defenses 
that he did not put the information on the form out of embarrassment or because he just forgot it is not credible.   He claimed the DUI was "completely over with."  But 
the arrest happened in the same year he completed the security form, and he was still on probation at the time he omitted the information.  Weighing all of this evidence, I 
conclude Applicant did intend to mislead the U.S. government by omitting this arrest information from his SF 86.  (Items 4, 5)</P> 
 
<P>In mitigation Applicant maintained he completed his drug and alcohol assessment program and required no counseling or treatment as support for a view that the incident 
was isolated. Further, he has not experienced any other adverse consequences of alcohol.  While he continues to drink, he does so only once or twice a week for a limited 
time period.  (Item 5)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted that in August 1999 he was charged with a misdemeanor violation of an injunction against domestic violence and in September 1999 pled nolo 
contendere and was found guilty and placed on twelve months supervised probation as well as fined and instructed to enroll in the Domestic Violence Intervention 
program.  (Answer, Items 5, 8)  Further, on the SF 86 in June1999 Applicant revealed no adverse information and certified that his statements on the form were "true, 
complete, and correct."  He was advised that a knowing and willful false statement of this form could be punished by fine or imprisonment or both under Section 1001 of 
Title 18 of the United States Code.  (Item 4)   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in 
evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(2)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive 
Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P>       </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criterion F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government raised security concerns over Applicant's financial problems: he has (1) a history of financial problems and (3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.a.-1.f.)  </SPAN>He has twice filed for bankruptcy.  He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 1986 where approximately $10,000 in unsecured debts were 
discharged in April 1987. While he claimed to have resolved his current financial position by having again filed for bankruptcy in March 2000, he provided no 
documentation of the discharge of his debts. He had the responsibility to present evidence of his steps to mitigate these issues.   In response to the FORM he presented no 
subsequent evidence that these debts had been resolved by discharge in bankruptcy nor any other evidence that he had addressed his financial issues in a way that 
demonstrates that his finances are now under control.  In sum, beyond his assertions in his Answer that the debts were discharged, he presented no further evidence that 
he had taken good faith efforts to resolve these past financial issues. Thus, I conclude he has not met the conditions (MC<A HREF="00-0501.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>) that mitigate these security concerns.   After 
considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.  under SOR 
Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government has security concerns over Applicant's alcohol-related arrest in 1999.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  
(1)  Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence.  When he was arrested for DWI, he pled nolo, was fined, and his license was 
suspended for six months.  However, subsequently, Applicant completed the court-mandated education program and was released early from probation for successfully 
completing all of the terms.  Applicant required no counseling or treatment. Further, he has not experienced any other adverse consequences of alcohol; while he continues 
to drink, he does so only once or twice a week for a limited time period.  Thus Applicant meets c<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">onditions that mitigate security concerns:  (1)  The alcohol related 
incidents do not indicate a pattern.  </SPAN>After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I  rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 
2.a. under SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government cited security concerns over personal conduct issues in that Applicant willfully falsified his SF 86 by omitting adverse financial and arrest information 
which was subsequently documented in his credit and arrest reports. Such conduct<A HREF="00-0501.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> reflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. While Applicant declared he did not intentionally 
omit this information from his SF 86, that assertion is an insufficient  defense to the requirement to be forthcoming on a security investigation.  The adverse incidents were 
current at the time he completed the form so his claim that he simply forgot is not credible.  Further, he does not meet the mitigating conditions as there his no evidence of 
C 3:  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts or of MC 4:  Omission of material facts was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.  
While Applicant excused his actions by saying he did not attempt to "hide anything,"  his defenses that he did not put the information on the form out of embarrassment or 
because he just forgot it is not credible.   For example, he claimed the DUI was "completely over with," but the arrest happened in the same year he completed the 
security form, and he was still on probation at the time he omitted the information.  Thus, I conclude that Applicant did deliberately mislead the Government by these 
omissions.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 3.a. through 
3.d. under SOR Paragraph 3.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges security concerns over criminal conduct issues because of his DUI arrest and conviction and the 1999 violation of the injunction against domestic 
violence.  Also he omitted relevant information from his security form discussed above.  The Government has  established a case of criminal falsification under 18 U.S.C. 
section 1001 as he was clearly put on notice of that section of the criminal code to emphasize that he had a duty to reveal all adverse information on the SF 86.  Instead he 
improperly certified that his answers were "true, complete, and correct." For the reasons discussed above, I conclude his conduct in omitting his material adverse financial 
and arrest data was knowing and willful in intent.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against 
Applicant on subparagraph 4.a.through 4.c. under SOR Paragraph 4.</P>
