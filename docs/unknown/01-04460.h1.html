<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 19, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be 
denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 10, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 25, 2001.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 1, 2001, and the case was heard 
on October 25, 2001.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also called seven 
witnesses to testify on his behalf.  The transcript was received on November 1, 2001.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted 
alcohol abuse and related criminal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> 35 years of 
age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.h. and 2.a.  The Applicant consumed alcohol with varying frequency, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication and blackouts, from 
about 1982 until he last consumed alcohol on August 5, 2001 (Transcript (TR) at page 98 line 6 to page 99 line 13, at page 107 line 10 to page 
108 line 18, at page 18 line 21 to page 119 line 13, Government Exhibit (GX) 10 at pages 1~2, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) E).  He "began 
drinking alcohol at the age of 16 . . . [and] would consume a maximum of six beers over a period of three hours" (GX 10 at page 1).  This pattern 
of drinking continued for about a year, when it was reduced to "about three beers on average on each occasion" (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>In February of 1995, the Applicant was arrested for and subsequently pled guilty to Domestic Violence/Assault (TR at page 102 lines 16~18, at 
page 106 line 7 to page 107 line 3, GX 1 at page 3, GXs 2 and 3, and GX 10 at 7~8).  He had consumed hard liquor prior to this arrest (<EM>id</EM>).  In 
ay of 1996, the Applicant received emergency medical treatment for an anxiety attack (GX 4).  He had consumed approximately six beers prior 
to this admission (<EM>id</EM>).  In March of 1997, the Applicant was charged with and subsequently pled guilty to Consuming Spiritous Liquor in Public 
(GX 5, and GX 10 at page 6).  Shortly thereafter, he entered inpatient treatment for a condition diagnosed, in part, as Substance Dependence 
(Alcohol) (GX 6 at pages 3 and 13).  Despite this treatment, the Applicant returned to the consumption of alcohol in "June or July" of 1997 (TR at 
page99 line 14 to page 100 line 7).</P> 
 
<P>In February of 1998, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, Assault/Domestic Violence (GX 1 at page 3, GXs 7 and 8, 
and GX 10 at page 8).  He had consumed alcohol prior to this arrest (<EM>id</EM>).  As a result of this conviction, from March to September of 1998 the 
Applicant received court ordered counseling for alcohol abuse (GX 9).  Despite this counseling, he continued to consume alcohol until a little more 
than two months prior to his hearing (TR at page 114 line 7 to page 117 line 1, and AppX E).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on a regular basis, and as of the date of his hearing had 80 days of sobriety (TR at page 107 
lines 4~9, at page 110 line 24 to page 11 line 5, at page 112 lines 4~10, at page 114 line 7 to page 117 line 1, and AppX E).  Those with whom 
he works only have laudable comments about the Applicant (TR at page 46 line 8 to page 52 line 23, and at page 54 line 8 to page 58 line 4, <EM>see 
also</EM> AppXs D and G).  His wife, mother-in-law, and friends are also very supportive of his sobriety (TR at page 59 line 15 to page 65 line 14, at 
page 67 line 20 to page 70 line 23, at page 72 line 11 to page 75 line 20, and at page 77 line 6 to page 96 line1).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, 
which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according 
to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, 
it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to 
evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as . . . spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or dependence;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the 
relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in Enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) which establishes 
doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's 
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective 
or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that 
the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an 
applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse, as evidenced by three alcohol related convictions.  In 1997, he was diagnosed as suffering from 
Substance Dependence (Alcohol).  Despite this diagnosis, he continued to consume alcohol.  In 1998, the Applicant had his last alcohol related 
arrest and conviction.  As part of his sentence, he was ordered by the court to receive counseling for his alcohol abuse.  Despite this counseling, 
the Applicant continued to consume alcohol until a little more than two months prior to his hearing.  Although he now attends AA on a regular 
basis, and as of the date of his hearing had 80 days of sobriety, it is too soon to say the Applicant's past alcohol abuse is not of security concern.  
Guideline G is therefore found against the Applicant.  <STRONG>This should not dissuade an employer from applying for a future security clearance 
on behalf of the Applicant, if he can demonstrate an additional year of sobriety.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the Applicant past criminal conduct, his last arrest was more than three years ago.  As this criminal behavior is clearly not recent, Guideline J 
is found in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Alcohol Consumption.  The Applicant has thus 
not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline  G, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guideline G.</SPAN></P>
