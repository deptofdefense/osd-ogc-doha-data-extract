<P><FONT FACE="Times">On August 21, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to                                          (Applicant), which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be
denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 8, 1997. The case was received by the undersigned on November 3, 1997, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on November 18, 1997. A
hearing was held on December 5, 1997.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><U></U>Applicant is a thirty-five year old woman. She graduated from college in December 1996,  and has been employed by a defense contractor since May 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">From January 1990 through December 1996, a</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">pplicant used marijuana on approximately thirty occasions and used Valium that had not been prescribed for her on six to ten occasions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that she last used marijuana at a graduation party in December 1996. She further testified that pursuing her professional career is now her top priority, and "there is no room" for
marijuana in her future. She testified credibly that she will not use it again</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">She further testified that she has not used Valium since at least 1996, and has no intention of using it in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Letters from three people who know applicant well (a supervisor, a coworker and a friend) were admitted in evidence (Exhibits A, B and C). These letters establish that applicant is considered to be
a reliable, trustworthy individual who performs well at her job.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><U><FONT FACE="Times">POLICIES</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth the Adjudication Policy (divided into Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the
foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are applicable:</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">DRUG INVOLVEMENT</U></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Disqualifying Factors:</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">1. Any drug abuse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">2. Illegal drug possession.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Mitigating Factors:</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">1. The drug involvement was not recent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">2. The drug involvement was an infrequent event.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">3. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that reasonably suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information. If the Government
meets its burden, it has established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. Once the Government establishes a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, the burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation, extenuation, mitigation or
reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the Government's </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, he or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the Directive's requirement that a
security clearance be granted only upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In this case, the Government established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case under Criterion H. The evidence establishes that from January 1990 through December 1996</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">, applicant used marijuana on approximately
thirty occasions, and used Valium that had not been prescribed for her on six to ten occasions. Applicant's illegal use of these drugs reflects adversely on her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness,
and reasonably suggests that she cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that she has not used marijuana since December 1996 and has not used Valium without a prescription since at least 1996. She further testified that she does not intend to use marijuana
or Valium without a prescription in the future. Considering the evidence as a whole, including applicant's demeanor and conduct while testifying, I find this testimony to be credible and worthy of belief. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In view of (1) applicant's approximately one year of abstinence, (2) her credible testimony that she does not intend to use marijuana or Valium without a prescription in the future, and (3) the very
favorable documentary evidence concerning her reliability and trustworthiness,  I conclude that applicant has reformed, and in all likelihood, will not use marijuana or Valium without a prescription in
the future. For this reason, Criterion H is found for applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">PARAGRAPH 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT FACE="Times"><U>DECISION</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.</FONT></P>
