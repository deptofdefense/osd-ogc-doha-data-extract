<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  In 1986, at the age of </P> 
 
<P>23, he drove drunk from a party after a college football game, and seriously injured two pedestrians.  He pled guilty to two charges of assault, was sentenced to 
10 years in jail, and other punishments.  He only served 30 days on work release, and five years probation.  Since then he has not been in any trouble, and is 
very active in his community with volunteer activities.  The Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) applies and disqualifies him for a security clearance without a 
waiver.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
 
<P>On September 29, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under the personnel security Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge 
to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 24, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant admitted all the allegations.  He requested a 
hearing.  </P> 
 
<P>This case was assigned to me on January 14, 2004.  On January 20, 2004, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing date for February 4, 2004</P> 
 
<P>On that date I convened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The 
Government presented seven exhibits, all of which were admitted into evidence. Applicant appeared and testified, and offered 11 exhibits, which were admitted 
into evidence.  I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on February 13, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all allegations in the subparagraphs of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant drove his car into two women crossing a street when he was leaving a social gathering after a college football game in 1986.  The two pedestrians 
were severely injured.  Applicant had been drinking at the party.  He was charged with Assault and Operating a Motor Vehicle under the Influence of 
Intoxicants (OMVI).  His blood alcohol content was .21.  He did not contest the charges, and regrets the entire event.  His sentence on the assault charge was 10 
years' confinement on each of two counts.  On the OMVI charge he was sentenced to 30 days in jail to be served in the "Community Treatment Center," which 
was a work release program.  Judgment was withheld and Applicant was put on five years probation, and order to perform 400 hours of community service and 
pay restitution.  Applicant also has a civil judgment against him for $10 million.  In case he should receive some type of windfall, that money would go to the 
victims' families.  Applicant successfully completed his probation. (Exhibits 2 to 7; Tr. 10, 21 to 36)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is married and has two small children.  He is 41 years old.  At the time of the accident, he was 23 years old and studying for his master's degree.  He 
is a software engineer.  He enjoys working on the government projects in which he is involved, and on which he was one of the first engineers hired. (Tr. 10, 
21, 33 to 35)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted several character letters from executives and other officials working with him at his place of employment.  Applicant also submitted a 
certificate of appreciation, a meritorious service award, four evaluations, and documents pertaining to his bonuses and other awards from work. (Tr. 6 to 17; 
Exhibits A to K)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is remorseful about the incident, and is sorry it happened.  Applicant does not drink and drive.  He is very involved in youth sports programs, 
continuing his community service work even though he is not required to do so. He fulfilled the terms of his probation, including making monetary payments to 
the victims and driving them to their medical appointments during their recovery period. (Tr. 9, 10, 22, 24 to 27; Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id</EM>. at 527.  The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  </P> 
 
<P>(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable               participation; </P> 
 
<P>(3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; </P> 
 
<P>(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(5) the voluntariness of participation; </P> 
 
<P>(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;</P> 
 
<P>(7) the motivation for the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and </P> 
 
<P>(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive,&sect; E2.2.1., Enclosure 2).</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  See <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  
Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  See Directive Para E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive Para. E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; see Exec. Or. 12968 Section 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.1. The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether  the person the person was formally charged;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.2.3. Conviction in a Federal or State Court, including a court-martial,</P> 
 
<P>of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.<A HREF="03-07804.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A10.1.3. Conditions which could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A10.1.3.6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A10.1.3.7. Potentially disqualifying condition E2.A10.1.2.3 may not be mitigated </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.<A HREF="03-07804.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Smith Amendment</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2001. </EM> The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of that Act.  The amendment was added to Title 10, United States Code, adding a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes 
the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific circumstances.  The Directive was amended in Guideline J to 
incorporate the new Disqualifying Conditions and procedural guidance on the waiver process when the conviction and sentencing condition is applicable.  The 
situation described in this case involves the conviction and sentencing Disqualifying Condition and the waiver procedural guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The statutorily required Disqualifying Condition applies to any employee of a DoD contractor, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of 
eligibility for access to classified information and who has been convicted in any court of the United States or a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year, regardless of the time actually served.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is quite clear in its statement that "A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability 
and trustworthiness."  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable here are 1 ( Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person 
was formally charged) and 2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).  Applicant has one conviction on two counts from 1986.  That conviction 
carried a sentence of 10 years on each of two assault counts.  The Government proved its case on these allegations under this guideline.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable on these facts in this case are MC 1 (The criminal behavior was not recent ) and 6 (There is clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation).  Applicant's terrible accident situation was 18 years ago.  He has changed and improved himself.  He regrets the incident.  He is a 
law-abiding citizen of his community.  Based on his sincerity and demeanor, and the facts in evidence, I believe his testimony.  The non-Smith Amendment MC 
here outweigh the non-Smith Amendment DC, and under those circumstances separately, I would find for the Applicant.  However, the disqualifications 
contained in the Smith Amendment control here, as explained in this Decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Regardless of the analysis under the Guideline J that would grant Applicant a security clearance, the Smith Amendment, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, precludes the 
granting or renewal of a security clearance to those applicants for access who have been convicted in any Federal or State court and sentenced to more than one 
year, regardless of the time actually served.  Applicant was convicted  in 1986 of the two counts of assault and one of OMVI.  The plea to the assault counts 
brought 10 year confinement sentences on each count.  Therefore, he falls within the purview of the Smith Amendment.  DC 3 applies.  MC 7 (which in some 
memorandum documents is lettered "g" under the mitigating conditions heading labeled "E2.A10.1.3, but I label here as "MC 7" for consistency in the 
Directive), the procedural guidance stated above, applies here. Applicant is ineligible for a clearance without a waiver.  I recommend further consideration of 
this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Paragraph 1 Guideline J: Against Applicant</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Subparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant</SPAN></P>
