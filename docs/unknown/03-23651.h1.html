<P>Applicant was arrested three times between September 2000 and September 2003, the last two for physical confrontations with his girlfriend. Applicant failed 
to mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 7 December 2004 detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 22 February 2005 and 
elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 18 November 2005. 
A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on 2 December 2005 and did not respond within the required 30 days. 
The case was assigned to me on 25 January 2006.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old analytical engineer for a defense contractor. Item 6 at 1, 6. He has worked for this employer since March 1998. </P> 
<P>In September 2000, Applicant was arrested for speeding, driving 100 mph in a 65 mph zone, and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. He pled 
guilty to aggravated unlicensed operation and was fined $200 plus court costs. </P> 
<P>Applicant and his girlfriend, with whom he lived, have a son who was born in October 1998. In August 2002, the couple had a dispute over whether he would 
go out with his friends. When he tried to leave with her cell phone, that he had bought and was paying for, she tried to wrest it from him. He ended up throwing 
her to the floor and then chasing her to a neighbor's house. The police were called and he was arrested for assault. Applicant's girlfriend admitted to the police 
that she had previously been arrested for committing domestic violence against Applicant. Applicant was charged with third degree assault, unlawful restraint, 
and risk of injury to a minor (because their son was in the house). Applicant reached an agreement with the prosecutor and the case was nolle prossed. 
Applicant received anger management counseling after this incident.</P> 
<P>In August 2003, Applicant's pregnant sister and her husband were visiting Applicant and his girlfriend. Applicant's sister was washing the kitchen floor. 
Applicant's girlfriend wanted to get something to drink, but Applicant's sister did not want her to cross the wet floor. An argument ensued in which Applicant's 
girlfriend threatened to hit his sister in the stomach. Applicant intervened. Later, Applicant and his girlfriend argued over the use of a television set. The 
argument turned into a physical altercation. Applicant's sister and brother-in-law intervened. Applicant called the police. He was arrested for disorderly 
conduct. His girlfriend was arrested for making a threat against Applicant's sister. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in 2000 (&para; 1.a); was arrested for and charged with 
assault, unlawful restraint, and risk of injury to a minor in August 2002 (&para; 1.b); and arrested for and charged with disorderly conduct in August 2003 (&para; 1.c). In 
his answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline J. Applicant engaged in criminal 
conduct (DC E2.A10.1.2.1) consisting of multiple lesser offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2). An applicant may mitigate security concerns raised by criminal conduct 
by establishing the criminal behavior was not recent (MC E2.A10.1.3.1), the pressures or factors leaving to the violation are no longer present (MC 
E2.A10.1.3.3 and E2.A10.1.3.4), and there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC E2.A10.1.3.6). I am unable to conclude these, or any other 
mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant insists that, since the relationship with his girlfriend ended after the August 2003 incident, the stress that led to his criminal behavior "has been 
completely removed," and "it is impossible to imagine any repeat occurrence." Item 3. But Applicant and his girlfriend have a child who, at least for the first 
couple of years, he helped to raise. If he still plays a part in the child's life, he would have to interact with the child's mother. He failed to explain the child's 
current status and whether he is still having problems controlling his anger. are just too many unanswered questions to conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
criminal conduct security concerns.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline J:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
