  In the decision below the Administrative Judge cites two different versions of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  It is not clear which version the Judge relied on as legally binding in adjudicating Applicant's ADP trustworthiness case.  In order to decide the merits of this appeal, the Board would have  to make a threshold determination as to which version of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is applicable in ADP trustworthiness cases adjudicated  under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  Resolution of that threshold determination would involve consideration of novel factual and legal issues not addressed during  the proceedings below.  The most appropriate course of action would be to remand the case with instructions to the Judge to reopen the record to allow the  parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argument as to which version of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is applicable to Applicant's  ADP trustworthiness case.  Case remanded with instructions.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Anna C. Ursano, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 18, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to automated information systems in ADP-I and ADP-II sensitivity positions for  Applicant.  The SOR was based on 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Michael J. Breslin issued a favorable trustworthiness decision, dated February 8, 2005.  Department 
Counsel  appealed that favorable decision.</P> 
<P>The Composite Health Care System Program Office, the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review (now Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals), 
and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA), effective 
April 9, 1993, under which the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) is authorized to adjudicate trustworthiness cases involving personnel working 
on unclassified automated systems in ADP-I and ADP-II sensitivity positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  This Board has jurisdiction on appeal by 
virtue of the MOA, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended), and DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, dated January 
1987 (as amended).</P> 
<P>The issues raised on appeal are: (1) whether the Administrative Judge misapplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1; and (2) whether the Administrative 
Judge's decision is consistent with prior Board decisions.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).<A HREF="03-21205.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because trustworthiness cases 
involving personnel working on  sensitive ADP positions are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge misapplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  On appeal, Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge 
erred by misapplying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  Applicant counters that the Judge did not misapply that mitigating condition.</P> 
<P>This case presents the Board with an unusual threshold legal question that must be decided before the merits of the appeal arguments made by the parties could 
be addressed in any meaningful way.</P> 
<P>  Applicant's case involves an adjudication of her eligibility for assignment to a sensitive ADP position.  Such adjudications are covered by DoD Regulation 
5200.2-R.  Under the MOA authorizing DOHA to adjudicate ADP trustworthiness cases, the procedures used will be those applied by DOHA under DoD 
Directive 5220.6, but the investigative and adjudicative standards are provided by DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.<A HREF="03-21205.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In the decision below, the Administrative Judge cites the language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 as it appears in Appendix 8 of DoD Regulation 
5200.2-R.<A HREF="03-21205.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  However, the Judge also cites the language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 as it appears in the current version of DoD Directive 
5220.6.  The two versions of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 differ significantly in their wording.  The Judge seems to hold that Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 1 as it appears in Appendix 8 of the DoD Regulation 5200.2-R<A HREF="03-21205.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> is the version applicable to Applicant's ADP trustworthiness case, but 
then construes and interprets it in terms of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 as it appears in the current version of DoD Directive 5220.6.<A HREF="03-21205.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  It is not 
clear whether the Judge's decision is relying on the language  of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 as it appears in the current version of DoD Directive 
5220.6 as legally binding in Applicant's ADP trustworthiness case or only as persuasive authority in construing and interpreting the language of Foreign 
Influence Mitigating Condition 1 as it appears in Appendix 8 of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.</P> 
<P>In order to decide the merits of this appeal, the Board would have to make a threshold  determination as to which version of Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1 is applicable in ADP trustworthiness cases adjudicated under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  Resolution of that threshold  question would involve 
consideration of novel factual and legal issues that were not addressed during the proceedings below.  The Board concludes that the most appropriate course of 
action would be for the Board to remand the case with instructions to the Judge to reopen the record to allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to present 
evidence and argument  as to which version of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is applicable to the adjudication of Applicant's ADP trustworthiness 
case, and to rule on the issue.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is consistent with prior Board decisions</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge's decision is 
not consistent with prior Board decisions.  Applicant counters by arguing that the Judge's decision is consistent with prior Board decisions.  Because of the 
resolution of the first appeal issue, it would be premature for the Board  to address this issue.  Whether or not the Judge's decision is consistent with prior Board 
decisions turns, in large part, on resolution of the unusual threshold question noted earlier in this decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.2, the Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing 
consistent with this decision.  After allowing the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argument, the Judge should issue a new decision 
consistent with the requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.35 and E3.1.25.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> This case involves an adjudication (under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R) of Applicant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive ADP position, not an adjudication 
(under DoD Directive 5220.6) of Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.  However, the Board can cite and rely on its decisions in security clearance 
cases when those decisions support legal propositions and principles that are pertinent to the adjudication of an ADP trustworthiness case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ADP Case 
No. 00-0131 (May 3, 2001) at p. 2 n.2.
