<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he accrued during periods of reduced family income following his wife's disability and ensuing loss of permanent 
work, which he failed to address after his finances improved.  With only unspecified assurances he will address his debts in the future when he is better 
positioned to do so, and no concrete plan for addressing his debts, he fails to mitigate security concerns associated with his past failures to address his 
delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 10, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 8, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on September 25, 2003, and was scheduled for 
hearing on December,18, 2003.  A hearing was convened on December 18, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits.  Applicant 
relied on three  witnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on January 2, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: He is alleged to have incurred 15 delinquent debts which exceed 
$13,600.00 in total and to have a net monthly remainder of approximately $32.00, indicative that he is financially unable to address his debts, which he has not.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of his debt allegations, challenging  only the listed debt to creditor 1.a (paid), creditor 1.l, which he 
claimed represents a double billing, the listed debt to creditor 1.n, which he claims unawareness of, and his alleged incapability of addressing his debts based on 
his $32.00 a month net remainder.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old senior mechanical installer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR 
and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accumulated considerable medical bills in the early 90s in connection with his wife's (A) medical expenses.  She required surgery, which Applicant's 
medical insurance failed to cover completely.  She became disabled following her surgery and was no longer able to hold a job and help cover her bills.  With 
his spouse no longer a source of income, Applicant was forced to assume a larger share of the family's household and educational expenses, which also entailed 
helping his three children attend college.  To help reduce his financial burdens, he contacted the seller of his van in 1996 to try to interest the company in taking 
back the vehicle he had purchased.  The company accepted his request and subsequently auctioned off the vehicle to satisfy the loan balance.  The sale left a 
deficiency owing of $7,507.00, which the lender unsuccessfully attempted to bill Applicant for.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant explored credit counseling in 1993 and was told by his credit counselor that he would be better advised to pay his debts separately, rather than try to 
work out a consolidated payment plan.  She suggested his van deficiency would no longer show up on his credit report in another year and that he would be 
better served to take care of his smaller medical bills initially. To date, though, he has made no attempts to pay these debts or explore repayment prospects with 
his  individual creditors (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 37-38).  While he claims the creditor 1.l and 1.n accounts represent a double billed and erroneous debt, respectively, he 
provides no further documentation from either of these creditors to corroborate his claims, and has failed to date to contact them (R.T., at 38-40).  Without 
some corroboration, these debts that appear on his credit report (ex. 4) remain attributable to him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before his father's death in 1992, Applicant and his family lived with his father in the father's house.  After he passed away, Applicant and W moved into her 
mother's house, where they resided for about six months.  During this period, his daughter and son moved into his father's house while Applicant was putting 
the house into shape to sell.   In May 2003, Applicant sold his father's house. With the $22,446.85 in net sale proceeds (after satisfying settlement charges and 
paying off the mortgages on the property), Applicant used his share of the proceeds (around $5,300.00) to pay off a $4,418.00 deficiency judgment taken by 
creditor 1.a (<EM>see</EM> exs. A and B; R.T., at 50-53) and some pending utility bills unrelated to any of the listed debts in the SOR.  He did not use any of the residual 
balance, though, to address any of his remaining debts.  Each of his remaining listed debts remain outstanding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the six months Applicant and W lived with W's mother, they helped her with her essentials's.  W's mother had medicaid but no other resources to cover 
her expenses.  Just before her mother's death in January 2003, W filed divorce papers in her behalf.  Although the settlement decree specifies obligations of the 
father toward W's mother, neither W nor Applicant have any realistic prospects for collecting anything (R.T., at 66).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the meantime, Applicant purchased the inherited interests of W's sisters in the home owned by W's mother.  Applicant and W finalized their purchase of the 
home from his mother-in-law's estate in December 2003, paying about $68,000.00 for the family home (R.T., at 44, 47-49).  He supplements his own income 
(over $30,000.00 a year) with his wife's disability payments, which currently net around $485.00 a month (R.T., at 61).  While he has taken on no more 
significant debts, he has taken no actions either to reduce his expenses.  He has no specific plan to take care of his old debts, but hopes to address them in the 
future after his daughter finishes her college courses and he pays off his truck. He provides no concrete time table, though, as to when this is expected to occur.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to be highly regarded at work, where he is described by his supervisor and co-worker as a structural lead man who is very dependable and 
trustworthy (<EM>see </EM>ex. D; R.T., at 70-71).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant accrued considerable debt, some medical related, some related to deficiency balances on returned vehicles, and others involving utilities, in the early 
90s after his wife became disabled and could no longer work.  Unable to keep up with his accrued debts on his own income, he let his debts become delinquent.  
Secure in his belief his creditors were no longer pressing him for payment, he has made little effort to date to contact any of them about payment arrangements.  
Altogether, Applicant accrued over $13,000.00 in delinquent debts, of which only the judgment taken against him by creditor 1.a has been satisfied.  </P> 
 
<P> On the strength of the evidence presented, the government may invoke two Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial 
considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P>Many of Applicant's debts became delinquent during a period of tightening finances surrounding his spouse's medical disability and ensuing income loss.  For 
this Applicant is entitled to considerable extenuation credit.  Extenuation is but one of the considerations to take into account, however, when appraising 
security risks associated with a delinquent debt history.  Equally significant are the choices the applicant made in addressing his debts when he is financially 
able to do so.  In Applicant's case, he has taken little action to resolve his debt delinquencies and relies on sincerely based but unspecified promises to pay his 
debts at some point in the future when he is better positioned to deal with them.</P> 
 
<P>Over time, our Appeal Board has shown general consistency in discounting promises  to take repayment actions in the future when resources become available.  
<EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0012 (December 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 29, 1999).  Put another way, the assumed possibility an applicant might 
achieve resolution of his outstanding debts at some future date is not a substitute for a worthy track record of remedial actions, or evidence of financial reform 
or rehabilitation in the present.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0614 (July 12, 1999).  Security clearance decisions are, of course, never an exact science, but rather 
involve predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility based on the person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See Department of Navy v. 
Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).   Without any payment documentation  or definitive plan to address his still outstanding debts, Applicant lacks the 
probative mitigation necessary to absolve him of the pressure and judgment risks associated with being in debt.</P> 
 
<P>In recognition of the extenuating circumstances attending his initial debt delinquencies, Applicant may take advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the 
person's control) of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate his debt delinquencies.  However, he may not fully invoke the mitigating provisions of MC 6 
(initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors), absent more concerted efforts to address his old creditors than he has shown to date.  Unfavorable 
conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to subparagraphs 1.b through 1.p as to the allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines governing 
Guideline F.  Only with respect to the allegations in subparagraph 1.a (covering the payoff of his judgment) does Applicant mitigate raised security concerns.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
