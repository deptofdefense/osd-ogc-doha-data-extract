<P>Applicant was born in Israel of Israeli parents.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1996 but used his Israeli passport to enter and exit Israel in 
January 2001.  He executed a security clearance application (SF 86) in May 2003 and answered "no" to the question whether he held an active foreign passport 
during the last seven years.  He surrendered his expired Israeli passport and renounced his Israeli citizenship in August 2005.  The security concern based on 
foreign preference is mitigated, but the concern based on falsification of the SF 86 is not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 25, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and E (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline 
C, the SOR alleges Applicant possessed an Israeli passport that was issued on July 2, 1995, extended on December 13, 2000, and expired on December 12, 
2003 (&para; 1.a.); he extended his Israeli passport after he became a U.S. citizen (&para; 1.b.); and he used his Israeli passport to exit Israel in January 2001 after he 
became a U.S. citizen (&para; 1.c.).  Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his SF 86 on June 4, 2003, by answering "no" to the question whether he 
had an active foreign passport in the last seven years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 3, 2005.  He admitted the Guideline C allegations and offered explanations, denied deliberately falsifying his 
SF 86, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2005.  On July 22, 2005, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for August 
23, 2005.  The case was heard as scheduled.  I kept the record open until September 23, 2005, to permit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  I 
received his additional evidence on August 29, 2005, and it is incorporated in the record as Applicant's Exhibit B.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
September 6, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He was born in Israel and naturalized as a U.S. citizen on October 25, 1996.  He attended college 
in the U.S. and received a bachelor's degree in computer science in December 2000.  He has never held a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents were born in the Ukraine, emigrated to Israel and became Israeli citizens, and then emigrated to the U.S.  Applicant's mother was 
naturalized as a U.S. citizen in January 1997, and his father was naturalized in February 2001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was issued an Israeli passport in July 1995.  In December 2000, he extended the expiration date of his Israeli passport in order to travel to Israel as 
part of a university student exchange program in January 2001.  He used his Israeli passport to enter and exit Israel.  His parents told him he was required to 
have an Israeli passport, annotated to show a waiver of the requirement for mandatory military service, to avoid being detained in Israel as a draft dodger.  
Applicant also believed he was required by Israeli law to use his passport to enter and exit the country.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 22, 2003, Applicant executed a SF 86.  He disclosed his dual citizenship and his travel to Israel in January 2001.  However, he responded "no" to 
question 15, asking if he possessed an active foreign passport in the last seven years.  When he was questioned about his dual citizenship by a security 
investigator four months later, he disclosed his possession and use of an Israeli passport.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant retained his dual citizenship because he feels affinity for Jewish culture and traditions, and he thought it was "cool" to hold dual citizenship.  He saw 
no reason to renounce his Israeli citizenship until he learned it was an impediment to a security clearance.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he misunderstood question 15, thinking it asked if a new foreign passport had been issued in the last seven years.  He 
stated he did not think the question applied to an extension of a previously-issued passport.  He initially gave the same explanation during his testimony at the 
hearing.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  However, on cross-examination he testified the SF 86 was a long document, he was in a hurry to complete it, and he could not remember why he 
answered "no" to question 15.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 22, 2005, Applicant mailed his expired Israeli passport to the Israeli Embassy, along with a cover letter expressing his desire to renounce his Israeli 
citizenship.  The letter was received by a member of the embassy staff on August 23, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., he or she may be prone to provide information or make 
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying condition may arise if an individual exercises dual citizenship 
(DC 1), or possesses or uses a foreign passport (DC 2).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A3.1.2.1., E2.A3.1.2.2.  Applicant's use of his foreign passport was a exercise of dual 
citizenship.  I conclude DC 1 and DC 2 are established.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions are relevant.  MC 1 applies if dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Directive &para; 
E2.A3.1.3.1.  This mitigating condition is established because Applicant did not affirmatively seek foreign citizenship, but acquired it by virtue of his birth in 
Israel to parents who were citizens of Israel at the time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2 applies if indicators of possible foreign preference occurred before the individual obtained U.S. citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.2.  This condition is 
not established because Applicant's exercise of dual citizenship by using a foreign passport occurred after he acquired U.S. citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When possession or use of a foreign passport is involved, the clarifying guidance issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, 
Communications, and Intelligence (the "Money Memorandum"), dated August 16, 2000, requires denial of a clearance unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the U.S. Government.  Applicant has met this requirement by surrendering his expired Israeli 
passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 4 applies if the individual has expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.4.  This mitigating condition is established by 
Applicant's letter to the Embassy of Israel renouncing his Israeli citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant made it clear during the hearing that he considers himself to be a U.S. citizen.  He retained his dual citizenship because he felt some affinity for 
Jewish culture and traditions, it was "cool" to hold dual citizenship, and he saw no reason to relinquish his Israeli citizenship until he learned it was an 
impediment to a security clearance.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence under the "whole person" concept, 
I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern based on foreign preference.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel argued that Applicant's failure to disclose his foreign passport "shifted the burden to the applicant to explain the omission sufficiently to 
negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification," citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004) at 5.<A HREF="03-26096.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The Appeal Board has rejected this 
interpretation of its decision.<EM> </EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the 
burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant's intent when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's intent at the time the omission 
occurred.  <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits his negative answer to question 15 was incorrect, but he denies intentional falsification.  His disclosures of his dual citizenship and travel to 
Israel in January 2001 support his denial of intent to falsify.  On the other hand, he is a an intelligent and articulate college graduate who meticulously provided 
detailed information on the SF 86 about his family ties and connection with Israel.  His intricate and somewhat convoluted initial explanation of how he 
misinterpreted question 15 as applying only to issuance of a new passport struck me as implausible and disingenuous.  He abandoned that explanation at the 
hearing, falling back to an explanation that he hurriedly answered the question and did not remember why he answered it in the negative.  His fallback 
explanation is inconsistent with the meticulous manner in which he executed the SF 86.  I conclude DC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions (MC 2 and MC 3) are relevant to this case.  MC 2 applies when the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the 
individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Directive &para;E2A5.1.3.2.  Applicant's falsification was isolated, but it also was recent, and 
Applicant did not provide the information until he was questioned by a security investigator.  I conclude MC 2 is not established.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 applies when the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Applicant disclosed his 
foreign passport while being questioned about his dual citizenship, more than four months after he executed the SF 86.  There is no evidence he was specifically 
confronted with his answer to question 15, but the evidence indicates the questioning focused on Applicant's ties to and preference for Israel.  I conclude 
Applicant's disclosure was not "prompt," and it occurred only after he was questioned about his ties to Israel.  The burden is on Applicant to rebut, extenuate, 
or mitigate disqualifying conditions.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the general adjudicative guidelines, I have considered the seriousness of Applicant's conduct.  Although his falsification was not alleged under Guideline 
J, it is relevant to consider that his conduct was a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.1.  It occurred only once, but it was recent.  
Directive &para; E2.2.1.3.  Applicant is relatively young, new to the workplace, and unfamiliar with security clearance procedures.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.4.  Insufficient 
time has passed to determine whether Applicant is rehabilitated and whether a recurrence of his falsification is likely.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.6., E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on his falsification of the SF 86.</SPAN></P>
