<P>Applicant had trouble paying his financial obligations due to a lack of income when he was out of work following an injury on the job.  After a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge in 1996, he began to gamble frequently at local casinos, primarily for recreation.  While he has used some winnings, which have been as 
high as $18,000.00 on occasion, to pay debts and expenses, he does not depend on gambling winnings to meet his monthly expenses.  Nor has gambling caused 
him to fall behind in his obligations.  Applicant currently owes state and federal back taxes because he claimed excess dependents for tax years 1996 through 
2001, and willfully failed to file timely federal and state income tax returns for several years, in protest of corporate policies and the actions of federal agents.  
Applicant submitted a May 1999 security clearance application indicating he had been delinquent on his federal taxes for 1994, but had since paid the debt.  
Over the 2001/02 time frame, Applicant filed all his delinquent state and federal returns, but personal conduct concerns persist because of his demonstrated 
disregard of his tax obligations for several years, and his lack of complete candor on his May 1999 security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 17, 
2002, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on financial considerations (guideline F) 
because of financial difficulties with a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, caused at least in part by gambling, and failure to file income tax returns with back taxes owed.  
Also alleged were personal conduct (guideline E) concerns related to regular gambling, to the underreporting of taxable income on payroll tax forms, to the 
falsification of a May 1999 security clearance application (SF 86)<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> for failure to report income tax debts, and to unsatisfactory conduct on the job.</P> 
<P>On June 4, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and  requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was 
assigned to me on July 1, 2002.  Pursuant to formal notice dated July 12, 2002, the hearing was scheduled for July 26, 2002.  At the hearing which was held as 
scheduled, the Government submitted fifteen documentary exhibits, which were admitted into the record.  Counsel for Applicant presented two exhibits, which 
were entered without objection,<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> as well as the testimony of the Applicant and the Applicant's landlady.  On the Government's motion, SOR subparagraphs 2.c. 
and 2.d. were amended to reflect Applicant answered "yes" rather than "no" to questions 38 ["In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on 
any debt(s)?"] and 39 ["Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"] on his May 1999 SF 86, although the Government continued to allege 
Applicant deliberately did not disclose on that form state tax delinquencies for 1995 through 1998 or a federal tax delinquency for tax year 1996.</P> 
<P>At Counsel for Applicant's request, the record was held open until August 5, 2002, to allow Applicant to submit documentation from his accountant regarding 
the status of any filing of a state income tax return for the most recent tax year as well as a complete copy of his March 1, 1998, security clearance application 
(Exhibit B-2).  By facsimile on July 31, 2002, Applicant's counsel forwarded a letter from Applicant's accountant, indicating Applicant had filed all state tax 
returns through tax year 2001.  Department Counsel having no objection thereto, the document was marked and entered as Exhibit C.</P> 
<P>On August 6, 2002, this office received a transcript of the proceedings held on July 26, 2002.  On review by the undersigned of the file, it was noted Applicant's 
counsel had failed to forward the complete copy of Exhibit B-2.  In response to a request by the undersigned, Applicant's counsel by letter dated September 18, 
2002, forwarded the original of Applicant's Questionnaire for National Security Positions, which was completed on March 1, 1998.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old first class carpenter who has been employed by the same defense contractor since September 1978.  He seeks a security clearance for 
his duties.  Never married, Applicant has for the last twenty-two years rented a room with limited facilities (a small refrigerator, microwave and bathroom 
privileges) in a house owed, and inhabited by, an elderly couple.</P> 
<P>Circa 1987 or 1988, Applicant shattered his knee at work.  Out of work almost eighteen months due to his initial surgery and medical complications, Applicant 
was without a paycheck for that period of time due to the manner in which his workmen's compensation claim was handled.  Applicant's savings were 
insufficient to cover all his expenses, which included the payments on a then new truck, and he began to fall behind in his financial obligations.  By the mid-1990s, Applicant was receiving calls from various creditors demanding payment of his delinquent obligations.  Faced with threatened repossession of his 1987 
model year pickup and a small claims suit against him by a hospital to collect on a debt, Applicant in June 1996 filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7.  Applicant listed as liabilities $3,359.62 in tax debt ($3,187.57 federal and $172.05 state), $7,479.39 in delinquent credit card obligations, and 
$368.61 in medical debts.  With a reported monthly net income from wages and veterans benefits totaling $1,867.00 and monthly expenses of $1,265.00, 
Applicant indicated to the court there would be no funds available for distribution to unsecured creditors.  In October 1996, he was granted a discharge of all 
but the tax debt.</P> 
<P>An occasional gambler at one of the local casinos (casino A) from the early 1990s, Applicant found himself without any credit after his bankruptcy.  Needing 
another source of income beyond his defense-related job, Applicant circa 1997 began to gamble with some regularity at two local casinos, playing the slot 
machines as well as table games (blackjack and baccarat). Applicant has since frequented primarily casino B, as he objects to the manner in which casino A 
treats its employees.  Since 1997, Applicant has gambled"as often as he can," with a frequency which has varied from five times per week-especially when the 
casinos have a promotion-to months with no gambling.  The funds used to gamble come from his wage earnings as well as from a bankroll (gambling winnings 
saved)<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and rotation of monies during the course of his gambling activities.  Applicant usually takes $20.00 to $70.00 with him to gamble, although on one 
occasion he started with $400.00.</P> 
<P>Especially when he is playing table games, Applicant is unable to track accurately his gambling winnings and losses.  The casinos report his yearly net gain/loss 
as tracked through a Player's Club card, which Applicant does not always put in the slot machines and never shows when he is playing table games.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Casino A 
reported Applicant lost an estimated $1,000.00 for 1997.  For those slot and table gaming transactions tracked by his Player's Club card or observed by 
management, Casino B reported losses by Applicant of $53.00 in 1996, $3,352.00 in 1997, $29,859.00 in 1998, $15,025.00 in 1999, and $23,897.00 in 2000.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  
On at least two occasions in 1999, casino B paid out United States Treasury reportable gambling wins to Applicant-$17,188.00 in March and $13,511.00 in 
September.  On one occasion in 1998 or 1999, Applicant parlayed $20.00 into$18,000.00 in winnings.  He left the casino with $7,900.00 that day, some of 
which he saved in his "cookie jar" for gambling and the remainder went to pay bills.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In August 1996, Applicant was notified he owed $197.86 in state taxes for tax year 1995, and that his account had been referred to a collection agency.</P> 
<P>Circa 1996/early 1997, Applicant decided to take a "radical stand" in protest of corporate greed ("They were taking our money and running away and having a 
good time."  <EM>see </EM>Transcript pp. 98, 148); safety issues on the job and what he perceived to be his employer's callous treatment of the workers; and the actions of 
the federal agents at Ruby Ridge and Waco.  For the tax years from 1996 through 2001, Applicant underreported his taxable income by claiming nine 
dependents on his W-4 payroll tax forms.  Applicant also did not file by their respective due dates state individual income tax returns for tax years 1996 through 
1999 and federal returns from 1996 through 2001.</P> 
<P>On March 1, 1998, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in application for a security clearance.  In response to 
questions posed regarding his financial record, Applicant listed his 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He also answered "yes" to whether a lien had been placed 
against his property in the last 7 years for failure to pay taxes or other debts.  Applicant responded affirmatively to both questions 28a ["In the last 7 years, have 
you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"] and 28b ["Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"] and added "All debts are pending 
legal counsel except taxes and I am in the process of making payment arrangements."</P> 
<P>Circa May 1999, the SF 86 completed by Applicant's hand in March 1998, reached the attention of his employer's security department.  Asked by security 
personnel about back taxes, Applicant responded he did not know what the tax debt was.  Told to put something down, Applicant estimated a $3,000.00 federal 
tax debt for 1994 which he indicated was "all paid up."  A typewritten version of his SF 86 was then generated on May 6, 1999, by security personnel.  Listed 
on this form in response to inquiries into his financial record were Applicant's 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the amount of $10,000.00 and  a 1994 tax lien by 
the IRS for a $3,000.00 tax debt, reported to be "ALL  PAID UP."  Listed in response to inquiries into financial delinquencies were the IRS tax debt for 1994 
and a $50.00 medical debt owed a local hospital from 1997.  Under general remarks was typed "SUBJECT STATES THAT ALL INFORMATION IS THE 
BEST TO HIS KNOWLEDGE AND DATES AND AMOUNTS ARE APPROXIMATE."  Applicant signed the form on May 6, 1999, without making any 
changes.</P> 
<P>In early September 2000, delinquent state tax returns were filed for tax years 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Advised by his certified public accountant he could not 
deduct gambling losses, Applicant arranged to have state taxes deducted from gambling winnings at the time of payout by the casino.  In mid-September 2000, 
Applicant was informed by the state's department of revenue services that he owed $2,285.99 for tax year 1997.  In mid-December 2000, the state demanded 
payment of delinquent taxes in the amount of $2,680.30 for tax year 1996 and $1,336.16 for tax year1998.</P> 
<P>Out of work for much of the 2000 calendar year due to a medical operation and complications, Applicant earned only $4,450.58 in total wages that year at the 
shipyard.  He supported himself primarily through disability payments of $380.00 per month, savings, and money gained through gambling.</P> 
<P>       </P> 
<P>Sometime in early 2001, Applicant retained his certified public accountant to prepare his federal individual income tax returns for tax years 1996 through 2000.  
By letter dated April 2, 2001, Applicant's accountant requested from the IRS a printout of any tax credits or payments on record plus any income reported.  In 
late July 2001, the IRS indicated returns were not present for tax years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000.</P> 
<P>In mid-June 2001, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) regarding his financial affairs and entries on his security 
clearance application.  Applicant informed the agent he did not want a security clearance, but had been told he had to apply for the clearance or he would be 
terminated from his employment.   Applicant acknowledged he had financial problems in the past, which he attributed to being out of work for eighteen months 
without compensation.  After some "few years" of trouble paying his bills, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and his debts, excepting state and federal 
taxes, were discharged.  Applicant admitted he underpaid his taxes for the tax years 1996 through 2000 by claiming nine dependents and he had gambling 
winnings on which he owed state taxes.  Applicant indicated he did not know the extent of his federal and state tax debts, so he estimated a $3,000.00 IRS debt.  
Applicant volunteered he had given his accountant a power of attorney to negotiate with the IRS and the state on the back taxes.   Other debts incurred since his 
bankruptcy consisted solely of copay charges to two hospitals, $50.00 to a local facility which was satisfied, and $25.00 to another medical institution which 
had not been paid.  Applicant indicated his current net monthly income amounted to $2,200.00 because he was still claiming nine dependents, and his monthly 
expenses totaled $1,940.00.</P> 
<P>Following the events of September 11, 2001, Applicant made an effort to ensure that his delinquent returns were filed, as the Nation was "at war" and needed 
the money.   Over the next few months, Applicant's accountant filed those state and federal tax returns for tax years 1996 through  2000 which had not been 
previously filed. </P> 
<P>On February 15, 2002, Applicant was reinterviewed by the DSS agent, this time about his wage and gambling income as reported in IRS records for the tax 
years 1996 through 1999.  Applicant expressed his belief his accountant had filed his delinquent federal and state tax returns for tax years 1996 through 2000, 
but questioned the accuracy of the income reported.   Applicant volunteered he had received, just four days before, six letters from the IRS which he had not yet 
opened.  As for his current gambling habits, Applicant indicated he went as often as he could, "sometimes two times weekly, sometimes five times weekly and 
sometimes not for months."  He reported saving some of his winnings and playing back the rest.  Those winnings saved were used to eat, pay rent, for expenses 
and "maybe save."  Applicant denied gambling had any impact on his personal finances.</P> 
<P>Sometime in 2002, Applicant changed his tax withholding to where he now claims zero dependents.</P> 
<P>On or about July 26, 2002, Applicant's accountant filed Applicant's federal income tax return for tax year 2001.  On his 1040 form, Applicant reported 
$32,685.00 in wages and $16,400.00 in gambling winnings to raise his adjusted gross income for that year to $49,085.00. With $1,272.00 in tax payments, 
Applicant owes the IRS $2,735.00 for tax year 2001.  By July 31, 2002, Applicant had filed all his delinquent state tax forms as well.  After recent tax payments 
totaling $2,000.00 to the state, Applicant owed $1,950.00 in back taxes to the state as of late July 2002.</P> 
<P>Over the June to July 2002 time frame, Applicant went to casino B about fifteen times, taking with him $20.00 to $40.00 on each occasion.  Applicant intends 
to continue to gamble in the future, primarily at casino B.  Applicant finds it a challenge to "out think" the cards, and it continues to be his primary form of 
recreation.  Applicant might alter his casino activities in the future, but only to the extent of keeping better records.</P> 
<P>With his rent at $70.00 per week, inclusive of heating/air conditioning, Applicant's living expenses are modest.  He does not depend on gambling winnings to 
pay his expenses, but does live paycheck to paycheck.  Applicant does not have any credit cards.</P> 
<P>Applicant's landlady thinks of him as her second son.  Applicant helps to care for her invalid husband on a routine basis.</P> 
<P>Between June 1995 and March 2001, Applicant was formally reprimanded at work, primarily for unsatisfactory attendance.  The recipient of several recorded 
verbal warnings and written warnings, Applicant views it as a game played by his employer.  On several occasions, Applicant pulled a "no show" when the 
assigned job was changed after he had committed to work overtime.  Some of Applicant's unexcused absences are due to his decision to stay with an ill father 
or coworker.  Of the opinion that his employer accords little respect to the yard worker and takes away benefits such as sick leave while lining corporate 
pockets, Applicant refuses to work any overtime.  Applicant worked substantial hours without pay when he was assigned to a project on the local military base 
in the past, as he felt he was treated fairly there.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section

an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines F and E:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under guideline F, financial considerations, an individual who is overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant had 
financial difficulties in the past, as evidenced by a bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 in October 1996 of $7,479.39 in delinquent credit card debt and 
$368.61 in medical debt.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>   After the bankruptcy, Applicant owed federal taxes of $3,187.57 and state taxes of $172.05.  As of August 1996, an unpaid state tax 
debt for 1995 of $197.86 had been referred for collection.  While Applicant did not incur any new credit card delinquency following his bankruptcy, he failed to 
pay his federal and state income tax obligations.  By September 2000, he owed back state taxes totaling $6,302.45 for tax years 1996, 1997 and 1998.  While 
the record is silent as to the extent of Applicant's outstanding federal tax debt for tax years 1996 through 2000, Applicant underpaid his 2001 federal taxes by 
$2,735.00.  The record also establishes that Applicant has gambled with regularity since about 1997.   Applicant does not deny gambling at casinos sometimes 
up to five days per week, usually starting with $20.00 to $70.00.  Given the legality of Applicant's casino gambling, his chosen recreational activity is of 
security concern only if it causes him to fall behind in his financial obligations (<EM>see</EM> E2.A6.1.2.5.).  Applicant denies gambling has had a negative impact on his 
finances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Characterizing Applicant as a "high stakes" gambler, the Government submits as proof of Applicant's gambling-related financial difficulties: 1) his use of 
winnings to pay for necessities such as rent, food, and expenses; 2) his inability to keep track of his gambling gains and losses; 3) his filing for bankruptcy in 
1996; 4) his failure to timely pay his state income tax obligations for tax years 1995 to 2000; 5) his failure to file or timely pay his federal income tax returns for 
tax years 1996 to 2000; 6) his posting of annual gambling losses as high as $29,859.00.  Applicant admits the use of winnings to pay for necessities, but  only in 
the sense that he co-mingles gambling monies with wage income which he then uses to pay his financial obligations.  There is insufficient evidence to find 
Applicant relies on gambling winnings to meet his monthly expenses.  Based on the income tax return filed for tax year 2001, Applicant's wage earnings 
amounted to $32,685.00.  While his adjusted gross income was increased to $49,085.00 because of gambling winnings, there is no evidence Applicant could 
not pay his expenses on his wage income alone.  Unmarried, Applicant lives modestly, renting a room at $70.00 per week from an elderly couple.  With only a 
small microwave, he eats out frequently, but he manages to remain in his budget.  Even during the calendar year 2000 where his wage earnings amounted only 
to $4,450.58, he had disability income of $380.00 per month.  The Government presented no evidence that Applicant fell behind in his rent or utilities during 
that year.  As for the inability to keep track of his gambling winnings and losses, Applicant admitted he had not always used his Player's Club card and never 
presented it at the gaming tables, so the figures reported by the casinos do not accurately reflect the extent of his annual gain or loss.  While he gambled on at 
least one occasion in the high stakes room, and casino B's records reflect substantial monetary payout to Applicant on two separate occasions in 1999, the 
$30,699.00 won does not account for other winnings that year or indeed, Applicant's losses.  As Applicant testified, his gambling winnings are often rotated 
back into slot machines or parlayed at the gaming tables.  Applicant testified to taking $20.00 to $70.00 with him to the casinos, which does not make him a 
high stakes gambler.  The absence of accurate tracking has an impact on his income as reported for tax purposes, but that is a separate issue raising personal 
conduct, rather than financial concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified credibly his bankruptcy in 1996 was not due to gambling, but rather to a significant delay in his receipt of workmen's compensation benefits.  
Applicant told the DSS agent in February 2002 he had been gambling in casinos for the last ten years, but there is nothing in his statement taken during that 
interview which indicates he was gambling extensively during that entire period.  At the hearing, Applicant testified he went to casino A on occasion 
commencing in 1989/90, but only once or twice per year.  He did not frequent the casinos until about 1997, after he had been granted the discharge in 
bankruptcy.  The record does not support that Applicant fell behind in his income tax obligations or failed to timely pay his income tax obligations because of 
his gambling.  Rather, Applicant made a deliberate decision to limit his tax withholdings by claiming nine dependents on payroll tax forms, which resulted in an 
underpayment of his tax obligations, and  he willfully failed to file timely state and federal income tax returns, as the following exchange illustrates:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q In this statement you're saying that your gambling habits didn't have anything to do with your falling behind on your income taxes either.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A That's correct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q Is that what you're saying?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A That's correct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q How is it that you fell behind on your income taxes?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A I stopped the tax thing when I say how the system stopped working for all of us, it's a collective of many reasons.  When I saw the abuse at [his place of 
employment], when I've seen my coworkers die directly or indirectly as a result of [his employer] that shipyard, it goes against the Constitution, it became 
corporate gain for them and we were dummies at the bottom.  It became, I did it because of many reasons because they didn't respect us, our cries fell on deaf 
ears in Congress on many issues and watched, I did.  And I saw how it didn't work for us, they didn't care, it was only corporate greed, and it still lives to this 
day.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript p. 75).  Since Applicant did not pay his income tax obligations in a timely manner, there is a demonstrated disregard of his financial obligations 
which falls within E2.A6.1.2.3. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), but it is not attributable to gambling losses.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As of September 2000, Applicant owed back state taxes of approximately $6,302.45 and he may well have delinquent federal income tax obligations for tax 
years 1996 through 2000 as well, especially where he claimed nine dependents during those years.  There is documentation of record in his own return that he 
underpaid his 2001 federal income tax obligation by $2,735.00.  Applicant has taken some steps in mitigation, through recent payments reducing the extent of 
his state tax debt to $1,950.00 as of July 2002.  By bringing his federal tax filings up to date, he has taken an initial step toward resolving the outstanding 
federal tax issues.  This favorable evidence must be weighed against several years of financially irresponsible behavior.  Applicant claimed nine dependents 
until sometime in 2002, as an act of protest of his employer's policies and Government agent's actions.  When he completed his SF 86 in May 1999, Applicant 
indicated he owed back taxes, but he had no idea of the amount.  He made no effort to determine the extent of the back taxes owed.  By September 2000, he had 
notice of a $6,302.45 state tax delinquency.  Two years later, he has yet to satisfy in full his delinquent state tax debt.  Nor is there any evidence he forwarded to 
the IRS the $2,735.00 with his 2001 return filed in late July 2002.  His expenditure of funds on gambling, when he had these tax debts outstanding, is 
particularly troubling.  Due to the lack of evidence proving gambling caused him to fall behind in his financial obligations, favorable findings are warranted as 
to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. of the SOR.  However, adverse findings are returned with respect to subparagraphs 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g., because of his 
deliberate disregard of his obligation to timely pay federal and state taxes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's handling of his federal and state income tax obligations also raises security significant personal conduct concerns (see E2.A5.1.2.5. a pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations).  Applicant filed with his employer claims for exemptions from tax withholding to which he was not entitled, not only for the tax 
years of 1996 to 2000, but for tax year 2001 as well (Transcript p. 99).<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant claims not to have known that his filing of false withholding forms was 
illegal until he was notified by his accountant.  (Transcript p. 80).  He testified he had been working with his accountant for three or four years, although he did 
not formally retain his accountant to prepare his delinquent federal returns until the March 2001 time frame (<EM>see</EM> Ex. 15).  Yet, he did not correct his tax 
withholding until 2002.  (Transcript p. 99).  Applicant deliberately did not file his federal income tax returns when they were due for tax years 1996 through 
2000, also as a statement of political protest.  Applicant's willful disregard of his obligations as a United States citizen to file returns and pay taxes is not 
justifiable, however legitimate the concerns about corporate greed or mismanagement.  While Applicant has a fundamental right to protest, his choice of an 
illegal means raises very serious questions for his judgment and reliability.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Although Applicant has corrected his withholdings and has filed all his delinquent 
returns, doubts persist as to whether he can be counted on to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.  There is no meaningful appreciation by him of the 
impropriety or illegality of his actions.  He continues to view his failure to comply with his tax obligations as an exercise of good judgment on his part, and 
equates his behavior to the tax protests of this Nation's founding fathers ("I want to be like our forefathers, Paul Revere, all them people, even Pewter the 
horse."  Transcript pp. 94, 137).    Subparagraphs 2.a. (as to that conduct alleged in 1.f. and 1.g.) and 2.b. are resolved against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges additional personal conduct concerns because of Applicant's failure to disclose on his May 1999 SF 86 his delinquent state income tax 
debt for tax years 1995 through 1998 or his $2,282.00 federal tax debt for tax year 1996.  Applicant denies any intentional concealment, citing his affirmative 
response on the handwritten Questionnaire for National Security Positions, dated March 1, 1998, from which the May 1999 SF 86 was prepared.  Although 
Applicant did not list any specific outstanding tax delinquency on his March 1, 1998 clearance application, he indicated "All debts are pending legal counsel 
except taxes and I am in the process of making payment arrangements."  (Ex. B).  Asked at the personal appearance whether he was referring to state or federal 
taxes, Applicant responded, "Any taxes, any and all."  (Transcript p. 117).  Although not in the detail the Government expects from applicants for security 
clearance, there was at least some disclosure by the Applicant that he had tax debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, there was no such disclosure on the May 1999 security clearance application.  There is nothing on the May 1999 security clearance application which 
indicates Applicant had a then outstanding federal or state tax obligation.  Given Applicant's representation on the March 1998 form that he was in the process 
of making arrangements to pay his debts, one could assume on reviewing the May 1999 form that Applicant had paid up whatever delinquent taxes he owed.  
The reality was that Applicant had elected not to satisfy his back tax obligations over the 1998/99 time frame because of his ongoing concern with the 
corruption in the system.<A HREF="01-24356.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Since he had not filed his delinquent federal and state returns for tax years 1996 through 1998, he may well not have known the 
extent of his tax indebtedness.  Lack of knowledge of the precise amount owed does not extenuate or mitigate his failure to indicate that he owed back taxes.  
The only tax debt listed on the May 1999 SF 86 was a federal tax debt for 1994 of $3,000 reported as "ALL PAID UP."  Applicant signed the form certifying 
that the information provided was the best to his knowledge.   Since he was claiming nine dependents on his tax withholding certificates, he knew he was 
underpaying his taxes.  Under these circumstances, his failure to list any tax delinquency on his May 1999 is found to have been deliberate within the context of 
E2.A5.1.2.2. of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The intentional omission of relevant and material information from a personnel security questionnaire is potentially mitigated where the information was 
unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness or reliability (E2.A5.1.3.1.); the falsification was isolated, not recent, and the 
individual has subsequently presented correct information voluntarily (E2.A5.1.3.2.); the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification 
before being confronted with the facts (E2.A5.1.3.3.); or the omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate 
advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided (E2.A5.1.3.4.).  None of these mitigating factors apply 
in Applicant's favor.  Applicant acknowledged tax indebtedness when he was interviewed by a DSS agent in June 2001, although he provided no specifics, 
despite having been notified by the state in September 2000 at his address of record that he owed $2,680.30 for tax year 1996, $2,285.99 for tax year 1997 and 
$1,336.16 for tax year 1998.  This general admission to tax indebtedness comes two years after his May 1999 SF 86, so it cannot reasonably be construed as 
prompt.  There is no indication of current deception by Applicant with regard to his tax debts.  However, he also refuses to acknowledge his lack of candor on 
his SF 86 about his taxes.  The Government cannot allow applicants to dictate the timing and extent of disclosure.  Applicant not having yet demonstrated that 
he understands his obligation to be completely frank at all times, adverse findings are warranted with respect to subparagraphs 2.c. and 2.d. as amended of the 
SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.e. and documented in exhibit 14, Applicant has been formally reprimanded at his place of employment on several occasions 
between June 1985 and March 2001, primarily for unauthorized absence.  In describing the incidents he could recall, Applicant explained there were occasions 
where he failed to report for work to stay with an ill or dying coworker or when the employer changed the job after he had already committed to overtime.  
However, Applicant also displayed a cavalier attitude toward his employer's policies ("Sure, I take time off when I think it's appropriate for me to take it off, 
not for them."  Transcript p. 132; "If I know I'm getting a warning slip, I'll take the four days because they can't fire because they have to give it.  I'll take the 
four, that's where that comes from.  If you've got warning slips there with four days on them in a row and the fifth day they can walk you, I would take the four.  
I'm proud of that."  Transcript p. 133).  While his absenteeism record alone would not provide sufficient basis on which to deny him a security clearance, it 
reflects an unacceptable tendency to act in self-interest without regard to regulation or propriety.  Subparagraph 2.e. is resolved against him due to the concerns 
about his judgment and reliability raised by his violations of his employer's rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is not doubted that Applicant earned the affection of his landlady.  Over the last three years, he had provided invaluable care for her invalid husband-care 
which her biological son appears not willing to give.  Applicant also has stood by his friends, even at some personal cost (formal reprimands at work).  Yet, 
given his well-documented history of disregard of rules and regulations, I am unable to conclude that Applicant possesses the requisite good judgment which 
must be demanded of those with access.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    
<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>The security clearance application Applicant is alleged to have falsified is improperly identified in the SOR as a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions.  While Applicant completed by hand a Questionnaire for National Security Positions on March 1, 1998 (Ex. B), he signed a Security Clearance 
Application EPSQ Version 2.1 on May 6, 1999.  (Ex. 1). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant's security clearance application dated March 1, 1998, marked and entered as Exhibit B-2, was returned to Applicant's counsel at his request, with 
the understanding a complete copy would be forthcoming after the  hearing for inclusion in the record.  A copy of one page of the clearance application was 
entered as Exhibit B-1 and retained.  Exhibits B-1 and B-2 are together considered to be a single exhibit. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant testified to $18,000.00 being the highest amount accumulated in his bankroll in one day at the casino.  He went home with $7,900.00 that day 
"three or four years ago."  (Transcript p. 181). 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Points, not gambling credits, are accumulated on the Player's Club card which can then be used for shopping in casino stores or eating in a casino restaurant.  
(Transcript pp. 159-60). 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Casino documents indicate the casino is unable to account for any gaming activity where a player's club card is not used.  The loss figures represent only the 
total slot activity (total coin deposited in machines less total coin paid out and less jackpots paid by hand with currency) tracked by the Player's Club card and 
the observed win/loss at the gaming tables.  Especially where Applicant does not always use his Player's Club card and also allowed his Player's Club card to 
be used by a friend on occasion, these figures do not accurately report his gambling activity. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>Applicant also testified to there being one occasion when he was working on a project at the nearby military base where he went to the casino really early in 
the morning and played $20.00 into a $10,000.00 win in the "high roller" pit.  He admitted calling in sick that day.  (Transcript p. 55).  This may well have been 
the same occasion on which he reached $18,000.00 in winnings before rotating the funds.  It is noted casino B paid out a substantial sum to Applicant on at 
least two occasions in 1999, although Applicant also testified to having won "big" at casino A once.  Hoping to get the money back, casino A gave Applicant 
the fanciest accommodations in a hotel onsite. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>There is a basis to consider disqualifying condition E2.A6.1.2.1., a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>Applicant's willful filing of fraudulent withholding exemption certificates so that less money would be withheld from his wages falls within Title 26, Section 
7205 of the United States Code:  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Any individual required to supply information to his employer under section 3402 who willfully supplies false or fraudulent
