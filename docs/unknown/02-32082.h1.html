<P>Applicant has been arrested multiple times for driving while intoxicated and other traffic offenses. He had numerous tax liens and a foreclosure lawsuit filed 
against him. He deliberately either omitted accurate information or provided false information for security clearance applications he submitted in 1996 and 
2002, and in a statement he submitted in 2003. He has failed to mitigate the security clearance concern caused by his personal conduct and the related criminal 
conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 03, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted answers to the SOR that were received 
by DOHA on October 8, 2004 and December 3, 2004. He admitted all SOR allegations, except those contained in subparagraphs 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b, and requested 
a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on June 20, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on June 30, 2005, scheduling the hearing for July 28, 2005. Applicant failed to 
appear for the hearing, but subsequently contacted Department Counsel and indicated he had been on medical leave, and apparently asserted he was unaware of 
the hearing date. An amended notice of hearing was issued on October 3, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 26, 2005. Applicant again failed to appear, 
but again spoke with Department Counsel after the hearing date and provided her with his reason for not appearing. Department Counsel, at my request, 
notified Applicant that if he were able to appear on November 3, 2005, I would conduct the hearing in his case rather than seeking to have it terminated based 
upon his multiple non appearances.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The hearing was conducted on November 3, 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government submitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-14, and admitted into the record without objection. 
Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary evidence. As requested by Applicant, the record was held open until November 11, 2005, to provide 
him the opportunity to submit material in support of his case. However, nothing was ever received from him. The transcript was received on November 18, 
2005.        </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicants' admissions to some of the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 67-year-old man who has been employed as a systems engineer by a government contractor since September 1999. He was previously employed 
as a mechanical engineer by the U.S. Navy from May 1989 until September 1999. He was married in September 1966 and divorced in March 1982. He received 
a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1966, and a master of science degree in the same discipline in 1973. He has held a security clearance 
since approximately 1989, without any complaints ever being made that allege he mishandled classified material or information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant executed security clearance applications (SF 86) on June 25, 1996, and April 3, 2002. In each SF 86, he certified: "My statements on this form, and 
any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith." He also acknowledged in each SF 86 
that he understood willful false statements therein potentially subjected him to the criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SF 86 executed on April 3, 2002, Applicant denied: 1) having ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs; 2) in the 
preceding seven years having been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense not listed elsewhere on the form; and 3) in the preceding seven years 
having had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts. In the SF 86 he executed on June 25, 1996, Applicant denied: 1) in the 
preceding seven years having had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts; and 2) in the preceding seven years having been a 
party to any public record civil court action not listed elsewhere on the form. Each of these denials was false.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the April 2002 SF 86, Applicant failed to list his residence in a western state of the U.S. from 1989 until 1999, and instead listed that his sole residence was 
located in a state in the eastern part of the U.S. However, he did list his employment in the western state from 1989 until 1999 in that SF 86.  The record 
evidence supports a finding that his permanent residence remained in the eastern state despite long periods of time spent residing in the state where he was 
employed. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to conclude his omission of the additional residence was a deliberate omission.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on August 10, 1996, and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of .08 or 
more [a blood test disclosed a BAC of 0.15. (GE 8)]. He pled nolo contendere to the DUI charge, was found guilty of that offense, and was placed on five years 
probation and ordered to pay fines and fees totaling $1,532.00. Additionally, his license was suspended for six months.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on September 7, 1996, and again charged with DUI,  Driving with a BAC of .08 or more [a breath test disclosed a BAC or 0.10 (GE 
10)], and other less serious traffic offenses. He pled nolo contendere to a reduced charge of Reckless Driving, was found guilty of that offense, and was placed 
on three years probation and ordered to pay fines and costs totaling $884.00.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN>  </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on April 1, 1999 and charged with DUI (GE 7). There is no information of record concerning the disposition of this charge. Applicant 
was charged with Driving While License Suspended on November 7, 1996. He entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge and was ordered to pay fines and 
costs totaling $845.00 (GE 11).<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> Although record evidence is scarce concerning the incident, Applicant acknowledged that he was cited for Driving on a 
Suspended and/or Revoked License on October 6, 1998 (GE 6, page 4). </P> 
<P>Applicant was charged with obstructing a public officer in August 1969. There is scant evidence of record in support of the SOR allegation, the record is devoid 
of any information concerning the alleged circumstances surrounding the charge or its disposition, and Applicant denied this SOR allegation. As such, the 
record does not support a finding that this minor and remote in time criminal allegation creates a security concern.</P> 
<P>A municipal school district filed tax liens against Applicant in 1995, 1997, and 1998, based on his failure to pay school taxes levied for the tax years of 1981-88, 1992, and 1995. The total unpaid taxes for those years were $12,885.90. A municipality filed a tax lien against Applicant in the amount of $1,954.43 in 
April 2000. A county filed tax liens against Applicant in 1990<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and 1995, totaling $8,350.26. The Internal Revenue Service filed a tax lien against Applicant in 
1995 for unpaid taxes in the amount of $5,664.85.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A mortgage foreclosure law suit was filed against Applicant on February 23, 1995. He was served with a complaint in that case on May 23, 1995, and an 
attorney entered an appearance on his behalf on May 26, 1995. A judgment was entered against him in the amount of $28,503.31 on October 16, 1995, and a 
praecipe for writ of execution in the amount of $35,147.09 plus costs was issued on December 1, 1995. The judgment was satisfied on January 11, 2001, but 
only after two ordered sheriff's sales of the property were continued, and a stay of execution ordered because a bankruptcy had been filed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement, dated May 29, 2002, to a Special Agent (SA) of the Defense Security Service (DSS). In that statement, he 
described only the 1996 suspended license offense and a single unspecified DUI. However, and contrary to the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.g, 
he never asserts in that statement that those were the only two times he had been arrested in the state alleged. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted another signed, sworn statement, dated April 28, 2003, to the same SA of the DSS. In that statement, he again provided information about 
the 1996 suspended license offense and a single unspecified DUI. However, this time he went on to assert: "these were the only two times I have had law 
enforcement contact or been pulled over or charged for anything including DUIs." He was thereafter confronted by the SA with information about other arrests 
and indicated he could not recall any arrests other than the two he originally described. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a third signed, sworn statement, dated September 26, 2003, to a different SA of the DSS. In that statement, he admitted he had been 
arrested and charged with DUI in connection with the August 1996 and September 1996 offenses, and asserted he could not recall the 1999 DUI. He also 
admitted he had been cited for Driving on a Suspended and/or Revoked License in November 1996 and October 1998. He went on to allege that the reason he 
did not list the DUIs in the SF 86s was because he did not consider the DUI charges when he prepared the form, and thought they were only asking about drug 
related offenses. He went on to further state that he had overlooked the questions regarding criminal offenses. </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-32082.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully viewed Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying during the hearing. I have also carefully considered the substance of his 
testimony and the information he provided in the various statements he gave to SAs of the DSS and in his answers to the SOR. I found him to be as evasive as 
he could possibly be in answering questions at the hearing, and the substance of his statements strongly indicates his conduct was similar when questioned by 
the SAs. His most common response when confronted with adverse information, namely: "I don't recall" is not credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Most illustrative of his lack of credibility is the record evidence dealing with the foreclosure of his house. In a signed, sworn statement he provided to a SA of 
the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) in January 1997, he asserted he was unaware of the foreclosure proceedings when he submitted the SF 86 in June 1996. 
When questioned at the hearing about the foreclosure proceedings and the service of a complaint on him on May 23, 1995, as indicated in GE 12, he insinuated 
he was unaware of the service and suggested it had been done by leaving the notice on the door of his house (Tr. page 54). However, after he was confronted 
with the additional information from GE 12 that an attorney had filed an appearance on his behalf on May 26, 1995, Applicant finally admitted he was aware of 
the foreclosure and had retained the attorney to represent him in the foreclosure proceedings (Tr. page 55).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant's failure to disclose in the SF 86s he submitted his multiple DUI and suspended license 
arrests and charges, the numerous tax liens that had been filed against him, and the foreclosure action, along with the false answers and information he provided 
to the Special Agent in the April 2003 statement severely undermine the ability to place any trust and confidence in him. His false answers, and the reasons he 
has given for providing those answers, raise significant security concerns.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading 
information concerning relevant and material matter to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other representative in connection 
with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination</EM> apply. I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline E and none apply. Guideline E is 
decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J based upon his multiple DUI and suspended license arrests and convictions, the 
false answers he gave in the SF 86s, and the false information he provided to the Special Agents, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or 
admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline J and none apply. Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM> is 
inapplicable because although it has been more than seven years since his last criminal arrest, it has been only about two and one-half years since he provided 
false information to a SA of the DSS in violation of 18 U.S.C.&sect; 1001. Applicant's evasive, misleading, and most likely false testimony at the hearing prohibits 
granting him any consideration under MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>. The remaining mitigating conditions clearly have no 
applicability. Guideline J is decided against Applicant.    </SPAN></P>
