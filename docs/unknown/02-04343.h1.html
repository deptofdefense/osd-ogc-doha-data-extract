<P>In 1997, the Applicant was sentenced to a 24~60 month term of incarceration following his conviction for "Driving . . . While Under the Influence of 
Intoxicating Liquor (F[elony])" (DUI).  His passenger, his fiancee, was killed as a result of his felony DUI.  The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 apply.  The 
Applicant now attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on a regular basis, has not consumed alcohol for about a year, and intends no future consumption.  The 
Applicant's Alcohol Consumption concerns have been mitigated.  However, the Applicant admittedly still owes is excess of $32,000 in past due indebtedness, 
and has done little to address these debts.  His Financial Considerations are therefore not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 24, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on October 6, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on November 7, 2003, and Applicant's reply was received soon thereafter.  The case was received by the 
undersigned for resolution on December 11, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's criminal conduct, past alcohol abuse, and continuing 
financial considerations militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 42 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. and 1.b.  In April the Applicant was arrested for a felony DWI (Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at pages 1~2, and GX 6).  The Applicant and his fiancee were 
at a casino, where they were provided "with beer over the course of the evening" (GX 5 at page 2).  The Applicant describes the circumstances preceding his 
arrest:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I consumed eight to twelve beers.  I was intoxicated when we decided to leave at midnight.  I was driving a new car . . . my fiancee wanted to go fast [and] I 
also wanted to test the vehicle.  There were not many cars on the interstate, so I took off.  I was doing 140 mph when . . . I lost control of the car.  In the 
resulting crash, my fiancee, who was not wearing her shoulder belt was killed (GX 5 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant pled guilty as charged, and was sentenced to be incarcerated a minimum of 24 months to a maximum of 60 months (GX 9).  He served "about 13 
months" in a "Conservation Camp," and the balance of . . . [his] minimum sentence of two years under house arrest" (GX 5 at page 2).  The facts admitted 
above bring this case within the purview of 10 U.S.C. 986, which disqualifies the Applicant from having a security clearance granted or continued by the 
Department of Defense.  In a meritorious case, the Secretary of Defense may authorize an exception to this prohibition.  In requesting that a determination be 
made in his case without a hearing, the Applicant has requested the consideration of a waiver (<EM>see</EM> GX 3 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.~2.d.  The years prior to his arrest, the Applicant "drank fairly heavily. . . . [He] went out with the guys on Friday and Saturday nights and consumed about 
one beer per hour, consuming about six or seven beers over the course of the evening" (GX 5 at page 2).  During his incarceration, the Applicant attended a four 
week alcohol rehabilitation program (<EM>id</EM>).  While under house arrest, the Applicant also attended weekly counseling sessions at AA (<EM>ibid</EM>).  Since his release 
from house arrest in 2001, the Applicant attends AA on a regular basis, and has not consumed alcohol since about December of 2002 (GX 3 at pages 1 and 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.a.~3.k.  As the Applicant avers credibly, there are past due debts and/or liens to nine separate creditors alleged in the SOR.  The first two are to two separate 
banks totaling $175.  He disputes these alleged debts as he has "no idea" as to what they pertain to (GX 5 at page 4).  The next two alleged debts are, in fact, the 
same debt to a third bank for about $10,359 (GX 5 at page 4, and GX 12 at page 5).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt (GX 5 at page 4).  The 
fifth alleged debt is to yet another bank in the amount of about $817 (GX 12 at page 5).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt (GX 5 at page 4).  
The sixth alleged debt is also to a bank in the amount of about $18,744 (GX 12 at page 6).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt (GX 5 at page 4).  
The seventh alleged debt is to a utility company for $124 (GX 12 at page 6).  He intended "to pay this debt in full in Jun 02," but has offered nothing to show he 
has carried through with his intention (GX 5 at page 4).  The eight alleged debt is for a credit card in the amount of about $2,448 (GX 12 at page 6).  He has 
done nothing to address this past due debt (GX 5 at page 4).  The ninth alleged debt is, in fact, a state tax lien for $2,234 (GX 12 at page 7).  It has been paid; 
and as such, the Applicant has been released from this lien (GX 3 at pages 12~13).  The final alleged debt is a county tax lien in the amount of about $148 (GX 
12 at page 7).  The Applicant has done nothing to address this lien (GX 5 at page 4).  In December of 2001, the Applicant had a positive monthly cash flow of 
about $1,571 (GX 5 at page 6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's AA sponsor speaks laudably of the Applicant's alcohol recovery efforts (GX 3 at pages 3~5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Conviction in a Federal or State court . . . of a crime and sentence to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">7. Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense . . . has 
granted a waiver.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown 
between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational 
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in 
all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude 
towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was convicted of felonious conduct that occurred nearly eight years ago.  He was sentenced to from 24~60 months of incarceration, of which he 
spent 13 months in a Conservation Camp and another 11 months under house arrest.  The third disqualifying condition is therefore applicable; and as such, 
under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986, Guideline J is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the Applicant's past alcohol abuse, the Applicant drank abusively prior to his arrest in 1996.  Alcohol was clearly a contributing factor to the accident that 
took the life of his fiancee.  The first disqualifying condition is therefore applicable.  Since his incarceration, the Applicant has turned his life around vis-a-vis 
alcohol.  He no longer consumes the intoxicant, and he attends AA on a regular basis.  These are clearly "[p]ositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety" 
under the third mitigating condition.  Therefore, I find Guideline G for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, as to the Applicant's Financial Considerations, he has done little to address his remaining $32,000 in past due indebtedness.  This is so, despite a 
positive monthly cash flow in excess of $1,500.  Disqualifying condition 1 is thus clearly applicable, as the Applicant has "[a] history of not meeting financial 
obligations."  As there is no mitigation here, Guideline F is also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Criminal Conduct and Financial Considerations.  The 
Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines F and J, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate 
burden of persuasion under Guidelines F and J.</SPAN></P>
