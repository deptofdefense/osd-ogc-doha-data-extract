<P>Applicant's active use of his foreign passport to travel to Iran after he became a U.S. citizen raise security concerns over foreign preference.  He initially 
declared that he would not relinquish his foreign citizenship or his foreign passport in order to comply with Department of Defense (DoD) policy.  Later he 
stated he had an intent to do so, but provided no evidence that he had relinquished his foreign passport as required.  He mitigated the allegations of foreign 
influence.  Although his family members are dual citizens, there is no evidence that they have ties to the government, or could be exploited by a foreign power 
in a way that would force him to choose between his ties to them and to the United States (U.S.).  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>When the Government could not reach a preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant,<A HREF="02-10601.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 3, 
2003.  The SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C) and in paragraph 2 over foreign influence (Guideline B).  
Applicant received the SOR and replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer of October 17, 2003; he admitted all allegations and requested a decision without 
a hearing.  </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who completed a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which contained ten exhibits.  Exhibit 9 was a U.S. 
Department of State Consular Information Sheet that I considered submitted for Official Notice.  Exhibit 10 was the August 16, 2000, DoD policy 
memorandum on Guideline C.  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on December 8, 2003.  Applicant received it on December 15, 2003, and responded on 
January 9, 2004 with his exhibit A.  On February 3, 2004, Department Counsel indicated he had no objection to this submission.  On February 20, 2004, the 
case was assigned to me. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant, 52 years old, went to work for a defense contractor in State #1 in March 1995.  He also is a visiting lecturer at a state university.  In April 2000 he 
completed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) to seek a security clearance. (Answer; 
Exhibit 4)  </P> 
<P>He attended college in Iran.  (Exhibit 5)  In 1984 he received a Ph.D. degree from a U.S. university in State #1. (Answer; Exhibits 4, 5)   </P> 
<P>He married a citizen of Iran in 1983 in Iran.  They have two children born in the U.S. in 1987 and 1991 who are dual U.S. and Iranian citizens.  (Exhibit 4)</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Born in Iran in1952, Applicant came to the U.S. in August 1974 to go to graduate school in State #2.   He then moved to State #1 where he completed his Ph.D.  
 He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1999 and obtained a U.S. passport in April 1999.  (Exhibits 4, 5, 7)   </P> 
<P>Applicant maintains his dual citizenship and travels on his Iranian passport to visit his elderly mother and siblings who live in Iran.  For example in August 
2001 he went to Iran on his Iranian passport and re-entered the U.S. on his U.S. passport.  He insisted in October 2001 he was unable to surrender his Iranian 
passport because it is his only link to his family remaining in Iran. He would not give up his Iranian passport until relations between Iran and the U.S. improve.  
With his Iranian passport he can enter without a visa.   (Answer; Exhibits 5, 6, 7, 8)  He has no plans to return to Iran to live.  (Answer) </P> 
<P>Applicant advised that Iran does not "honor" the foreign citizenship of the Iranian nationals and as a practice does not renounce Iranian citizenship based on the 
assumption of foreign citizenship.  (Answer)  In May 2003 and again in January 2004 Applicant stated he was willing "not to renew" his Iranian passport, but 
he provided no evidence that he took any steps to implement his intent.  Also, he stated he would be willing to renounce his foreign citizenship, but provided no 
evidence of steps to implement this intent.  (Exhibit A)</P> 
<P>All of his financial interests are in the U.S.  Applicant provides no financial assistance to his relatives in Iran nor to any foreign organization or educational 
institution. He never served in the military in Iran and has no financial interests there, nor does he receive any benefits from Iran. He  has never been 
approached by any foreign intelligence operatives and would report any such approaches to his security officer or to the FBI.  (Answer; Exhibits 5, 6; Exhibit A)</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's mother has visited the U.S. twice, but is too ill to move here, even though she is eligible.  (Answer)  Nothing in her background would make her 
vulnerable to coercion, pressure or influence.  </P> 
<P>His father-in-law is a citizen of Iran but has been granted residency in the U.S.  (Answer)  Nothing in his background would make him vulnerable to coercion, 
pressure or influence.  </P> 
<P>Applicant  has three siblings who are residents of and citizens of Iran.  None of them work for the government or are agents of a foreign power.  His brother is a 
radiologist in private practice.   His elder sister is retired; she and her husband are in the process of obtaining U.S. residency.  His younger sister is self-employed.  His family in Iran has no affiliation with the Government of Iran.  (Answer; Exhibit A)  Nothing in their background would make them vulnerable 
to coercion, pressure or influence.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's spouse is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran; she has lived in the U.S. since 1984 and received her BA and MA in the U.S.; she is a teacher in a U.S. 
school system.  She maintains her passport to visit her parents in Iran.  (Answer; Exhibit A)  Nothing in her background would make her vulnerable to coercion, 
pressure or influence.  </P> 
<P>Their two children are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran; both were born in the U.S. and are on their mother's passport.  (Answer; Exhibit A)  Nothing in their 
background would make them vulnerable to coercion, pressure or influence.  </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>U.S. Department of State Guidance</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>The U.S. Department of State Consular Information Guidance on Iran notes the current government emphasizes vehement anti-U.S. stances; the U.S. prohibits 
most trade with Iran.   U.S. citizens who go to Iran should exercise caution as authorities sometimes confiscate the U.S. passports of U.S.-Iranian dual nationals.  
(Exhibit 9)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility divided into conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's 
access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the 
evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed the following relevant Adjudication Guidelines:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG><A HREF="02-10601.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</STRONG>:</P> 
<P>(1)  the exercise of dual citizenship; </P> 
<P>(2)  possession and/or use of a foreign passport<A HREF="02-10601.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>; </P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)   a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may 
be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference     </STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's active exercise of his dual citizenship by using his Iranian passport  for travel to Iran after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen raises a security 
concern under Guideline C, Foreign Preference as he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  the exercise of dual citizenship and (2)  possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport.  In addition, DoD policy clarification of August 16, 2000 explains that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying<A HREF="02-10601.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
condition.  To mitigate an Applicant must surrender his foreign passport or obtain official approval for its use.  While dual citizenship is not prohibited <EM>per se 
</EM>by policies of the United States, any conduct indicating possible foreign preference does raise a security concern where such action would increase the risk of an 
individual being influenced by the needs, desires, or aims of a foreign nation.  Applicant's possible foreign preference arise from his active exercise of dual 
citizenship even after he became a U.S. citizen.  Applicant possessed a foreign passport and used it on trips to Iran to visit his family even after his U.S. 
passport was issued to him.  Applicant did so for convenience rather than to attempt to get an Iranian visa on his U.S. passport.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided no evidence that he as relinquished his foreign passport.  As long as he retains possession of this  passport, he has not complied with 
Department of Defense (DoD) policy.  Further, while he states he is willing to relinquish his citizenship in Iran, he provided no evidence to establish that his 
intent is credible.  Clearly, his motivation to continue to visit his elderly mother is strong.  While his reservations about the difficulties of traveling to Iran on 
his U.S. passport may be  well founded and even confirmed by State Department guidance, under DoD policy that is not a basis to justify or excuse use of a 
foreign passport while a U.S. citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant maintains that he would not compromise classified U.S. information, that statement alone does not establish sufficient the preference for the 
U.S. under DoD security policy.  After reviewing all of the evidence in the record and considering all of the security policies, including the August 16, 2000, 
policy clarification memorandum, I conclude he has not met the DoD mitigation conditions to indicate his clear preference for the United States.  Acts 
indicative of foreign preference warrant careful scrutiny.  Hence, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.b against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant mitigated the Government's security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a foreign 
country: Applicant's relatives  have no current ties to their foreign government; nor is there any substantial likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence 
over Applicant.  While his mother and siblings reside in Iran, one sister is in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen.  His wife and children, while dual citizens, 
live in the U.S.  None of his relatives have any ties to the government of Iran.  Applicant is not vulnerable to duress merely because of these family ties.  
Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, 
or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.   Since Iran and the U.S. have no established diplomatic relations, acts indicative of foreign influence 
warrant careful scrutiny.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, here I conclude these family ties do not raise such concerns.  
Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e. in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.Guideline C:     AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to 
the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigation factor addresses 
the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this guideline are that possession and use of a 
foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate 
foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the
