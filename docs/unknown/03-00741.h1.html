on active duty.  Applicant had four arrests and convictions for driving while intoxicated from 1989 to 2002.  His driving privileges have been suspended.  He 
has one conviction in 2000, for driving on a suspended license.  He admitted to drinking to excess on occasions from 1975 to 2002.  Applicant was jailed as

consumption and his criminal conduct.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 15, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G 
(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 25, 2004.  He did not provide complete information and was requested by DOHA on May 3, 2004, to 
complete his response.  He provided a complete response on May 12, 2004, admitting all the allegations under Guidelines G and J and requesting a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The request for a hearing was received by DOHA on May 18, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the 
case on September 9, 2004, and the case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 15, 2004.   A notice of hearing was issued on October 21, 
2004 for a hearing scheduled for November 10, 2004.  Applicant's  requested for a continuance of the hearing scheduled for November 10, 2004 was granted.  
The case was reassigned to me on December 9, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 14, 2005 and the hearing was held on February 3, 2005.  
Seven government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant and two Applicant witnesses were received during the hearing.  The 
transcript was received on February 14, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old electronic maintenance communications technician for a defense contractor.  He retired from active military duty after serving 20 
years in communications and electronics maintenance.  He was granted a security clearance while on active duty.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He admitted he drank alcohol to excess from 
1975 to 2002.  He admitted he had been arrested and convicted four times from 1989 to 2002 for driving offenses involving alcohol to include driving while 
intoxicated.  He admitted he had been arrested and convicted for driving with a suspended driver's license.  He admitted to attending alcohol treatment 
programs as a result of his alcohol related driving convictions.  He admitted to being arrested on false imprisonment and kidnaping charges that were not 
prosecuted.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant started drinking alcohol at age 18, the legally permissible age to drink alcohol in the state he was living.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He was arrested and convicted in 1988 
while he was on active military duty for drinking in public.  Again while still on active duty, Applicant was arrested and convicted in 1989 for driving while 
intoxicated and was fined, received a suspended jail sentence, and placed on probation.  His driver's license was also suspended.  He was again arrested and 
convicted in March 2000, for driving under the influence, and was fined and received a suspended jail sentence.  His driver's license was again suspended.  He 
was convicted in September 2000, for driving under the influence and on a suspended license.  He was sentenced to a fine, a short jail sentence and his driver's 
license was again suspended.  As a result of this conviction, he attended a court ordered alcohol treatment program.  Applicant was arrested in April 2002, for 
again driving under the influence and on a suspended driver's license.  He was sentenced to serve 60 days in jail, placed on probation after his jail sentence, to 
pay a fine, and his driver's license was suspended indefinitely.  Again, Applicant attended a court ordered alcohol treatment program.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married in October 1980 and has three children.  He and his family lived in  a number of locations while Applicant was on active military duty.  
Applicant and his spouse had marital problems after Applicant retired from active military duty in 1996.  They separated in 1999, and were finally divorced in 
December 2001.  When Applicant and his wife separated, Applicant moved from the home.  Applicant was drinking alcohol heavily during this time.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He 
purchased a home near his family in September 2001,  and his oldest daughter moved in with him.  His wife also was engaged to another man and this upset 
Applicant.  Applicant visited bars and drank at home.  His appearance was slovenly and he was not neat at home.  During this time, he was distant from his 
family and disregarded them.  He continued to drink heavily until his arrest for driving under the influence in April 2002.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's 60 day jail sentence in 2002 caused a change in his attitude and behavior.  During his 60 day jail sentence, Applicant's daughter paid his bills but 
because he was not working, he was barely solvent.  After being released from jail in June 2002, he attended court ordered alcohol counseling.  Applicant 
became more concerned with family matters, took care of his home, and ensured his personal appearance was appropriate.  He started improving his house and 
added special feature.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>   Since Applicant's license was suspended, his daughter drove him to work.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife started seeing each other again and 
were remarried in December 2004.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He has paid all of his recurring expenses on time and has managed to save also $20,000.  Since his remarriage in December 
2004, his wife now drives him to work since his driver's license is still suspended.  He has a good support system from his family, i.e. his wife, married 
daughter and grandson, and his other two children at home.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His supervisor is aware of his past drinking problems but considers him a good, honest, hard 
worker who does not have work related problems.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's drinking habits also changed as a result of his time in jail from April to June 2002 and court ordered alcohol counseling.  He stopped drinking.  
From June 2002 until February 2005, Applicant drank only one beer on two occasions and had a sip of champagne at his remarriage in December 2004.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  
Applicant completed a court ordered private sector alcohol treatment program after his third driving while intoxicated conviction in 2000 with a fair to fairly 
good prognosis.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Applicant completed a court ordered military operated alcohol treatment program after completing his jail sentence in June 2002.  At the start 
of this program, Applicant was evaluated by licensed clinical social workers with an admissions diagnosis of alcohol dependence.  A discharge diagnosis was 
not made.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant also attended some Alcohol Anonymous meetings but does not now participating in any such programs.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant was recently 
examined by a licensed clinical social worker in a recognized alcohol treatment program with a favorable result and prognosis.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's sister was murdered and nephew severely wounded by intruders in May 2001.  Applicant and his brothers went to the area to attend to the sister's 
family and their mother.  They also wanted to assist police in apprehending the individuals responsible for the attack.  One of Applicant's brothers hired an 
individual to help apprehend the assailants.  While Applicant was at the airport picking up his daughter, the brothers and the other man abducted an individual 
they thought was the assailant, tied him up, and put him in the back of a car.  The brothers located Applicant at the mother's house and told him they had an 
individual in their car.  Applicant and his brothers drove around for awhile discussing what to do and decided to turn the individual into the police.  Applicant, 
his two brothers, and the other individual were arrested and charge with kidnaping and false imprisonment.  His brothers and the other person were convicted of 
false imprisonment and sentenced.  Applicant was not prosecuted since applicant was not present when the individual was apprehended.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a

(5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)

<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant

doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption:  A security concern exists because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of information due to carelessness.</P> 
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct:  A security concern exists because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability 
and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as, those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G.  Applicant's convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol, public drinking, and attendance 
at alcohol treatment programs brings the matter under Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, . . . or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>); and E2.A7.1.2.4 (<EM>evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>).  Applicant had four convictions for driving 
while intoxicated in twelve years.  He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by licensed clinical social workers in two separate alcohol treatment program.  
However, Applicant's consumption of one beer on two separate occasions and a sip of champagne in almost three years is not an excessive consumption of 
alcohol or the abuse of alcohol that would trigger Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition E2.A7.1.2.6 (<EM>consumption of alcohol subsequent to a 
diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program</EM>).</P> 
<P>The Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions that apply to Applicant's alcohol consumption are E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>the problem occurred a number of years ago 
and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>); and E2.A7.1.3.3 (<EM>positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>).  The last alcohol related incident 
occurred in 2002 almost three years ago.  Since that incident, Applicant has changed his alcohol-related behavior significantly.  He has very little alcohol 
consumption ( two beers and a sip of champagne) in the intervening three years.  He has taken pride in the appearance of his home and himself.  He has 
improved his finances and is saving his financial resources.  He continues to work for the same employer and is highly thought of by them.  He has reconciled 
with his wife and has remarried her.  While he has not taken advantage of alcohol support groups or programs, he does have a good support group with his wife, 
children, and grandson.  Applicant's alcohol problems occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of recent problems.  There are positive changes 
in behavior that support his sobriety.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns of alcohol consumption.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J.  Applicant's arrests and convictions for driving under the influence, public drinking, and driving 
with a suspended driver's license, and his arrest for false imprisonment brings the conduct under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.2.1 
(<EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>), and E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple 
lesser offenses</EM>).  There is no dispute Applicant was arrested and convicted on the alcohol related offenses, for driving with a suspended driver's license, and 
arrested for false imprisonment.</P> 
<P>The Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions that apply to Applicant are E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>); and E2.A10.1.3.5 (<EM>acquittal</EM>).  
Applicant's alcohol related criminal behavior happened from 1988 to 2002.  Since 2002, there have been no recent alcohol related offenses.  He has only a 
limited consumption of alcohol so as not to cause a repeat of such criminal behavior.  Applicant has not driven since his license was suspended indefinitely in 
2002 and has others drive him to work.  There have been no more driving related offenses since 2002.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any security concerns 
based on alcohol-related criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>The arrest for false imprisonment was the only criminal behavior not tied to alcohol consumption.  The fact Applicant was arrested for a criminal offense does 
not prove Applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  The fact criminal charges were dropped or dismissed is not dispositive of the issue.  The underlying basis of 
the criminal charges should be considered to determine if Applicant engaged in criminal conduct.<A HREF="03-00741.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Applicant's brothers imprisoned the alleged assailant, took 
the person to Applicant, and asked for his help.  The person was turned over to the police.  While it is difficult to determine why prosecutors decided not to try 
Applicant but did try the brothers, it is reasonable to conclude that Applicant did not engage in criminal activity and there was no basis for a prosecution.  I 
conclude Applicant did not engage in criminal activity concerning the false imprisonment.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any security concerns under 
Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept to reach a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  I conclude 
Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
