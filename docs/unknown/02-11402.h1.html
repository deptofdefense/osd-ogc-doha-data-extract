<P>The Applicant's parents and sister are citizens and residents of Iran.  His father-in-law is an Iranian citizen living in the U.S. and his mother-in-law is a 
naturalized U.S. citizen living in the U.S.  The record evidence is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 20, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-11402.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. On April 
1, 2003, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 27, 2003, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated May 5, 2003, and was given the opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation. The Applicant's response to the FORM was due on June  26, 2003. No response has 
been received. I was assigned the case on September 3, 2003. The Department Counsel presented eight exhibits (Items).  The record closed on September 3, 
2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B). The Applicant admits: his parents and sister are citizens of Iran living there and his father-in-law is a citizen 
of Iran.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 41-years-old, has worked for a defense contractor since December 2001, and is seeking a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was born in Iran.  In November 1997,  he came to the U.S. to attend school and to make a life for himself.  Since coming to the U.S., his only 
return to Iran was during the summer of 1979. In 1983, his father visited him in the United States. In July 1991, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  His 
parents are citizens and residents of Iran, both of whom have U.S. alien registration cards. The Applicant last saw his father in 1992, which was the last time his 
father was in the U.S.  His father is self-employed in the poultry/live stock trade and has no connections with the Iranian government. (Item 5, p.2)  He last saw 
his mother, a retired school teacher, in 1998.  His mother visits the U.S. every two or three years.  She was last in the U.S. in 2002, when she visited the 
Applicant's sister.  He calls his parents monthly.  The Applicant's only financial interest in Iran is his possibility of inheritance. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's father-in-law is a citizen of Iran, residing in the U.S., and owns a car wash. His father-in-law is more than 73 years of age, is not proficient in 
English, and because of the language requirements is not likely to qualify for U.S. citizenship.  His mother-in-law is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  The Applicant's 
sister is an Iranian citizen, residing in Iran who is a housewife, mother, and has no connection with the Iranian government.  He occasionally talks with her by 
telephone.  His sister visited him in the U.S. in 1983 and 1991. The Applicant has another sister who lives in the U.S. who was born in Iran and became a 
naturalized U.S. citizen in January, 1991. The Applicant has other extended family members in Iran to whom he is not close nor with whom he maintains 
contact. The Applicant's wife was born in Iran and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March, 1999.  The Applicant is willing to bear arms against Iran, if 
necessary. (Item 5)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P>  Foreign Influence (Guideline B) The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  
E2.A2.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country; E2.A2.1.2.1. </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </P> 
 
<P>1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States; E2.A2.1.3.1. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> 484 U.S. at 527.  The President has restricted 
eligibility for access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United 
States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential 
for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2" The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, at 
531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, (Foreign Influence).  Under Guideline B, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person has immediate family and other persons to whom he is bound by affection who are not citizens of the United States, reside 
in a foreign country, or may be subject to duress. The Applicant's parents and sister are citizens and residents of Iran. Thus, DC 1<A HREF="02-11402.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he is not at risk of being vulnerable due to family ties.  He must show close relatives are not in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Additionally, the Applicant's parents and sister are immediate family members, with whom the individual has 
close ties of affection and are citizens of, and reside in a foreign country. His father is self employed in the poultry/ live stock trade business, his mother is a 
retired school teacher, and his sister is a housewife. There is no showing his parents or sister are agents of a foreign government. The Applicant's contact with 
his parents and sister cannot be said to be causal or infrequent. Therefore, MC 3 does not apply to them. </P> 
 
<P>There is no indication the Applicant provides support to his relatives in Iran nor that they provide him support.  However, because of the strength of the 
Applicant's ties with family members the security concerns engendered by the foreign citizenship of his parents and sister, who reside in Iran, are not mitigated. 
I find against the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.a. and 1.c.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's father-in-law is an Iranian citizen, but resides in the U.S. and owns a car wash.  His mother-in-law is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the 
U.S.  I find MC 1<A HREF="02-11402.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> applicable as to his parents-in-law and find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.b. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant may, at some future date, inherit property from relatives in Iran. The possibility of inheritance is purely speculative and, in this instance, of no 
security relevance. An Applicant does not have a financial stake in a country merely because he may inherit property at some future date. See ISCR Case No. 
97-0403 at page 3 (Appeal Board decision May 13, 1998) </P> 
 
<P>In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P>
