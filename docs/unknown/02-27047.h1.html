<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense contractor. She was arrested in 1995 and charged with credit card theft, pled guilty, 
and was sentenced to five years confinement suspended with three years supervised probation and a fine of $350. Applicant is indebted to four creditors for a 
total amount of over $7,000.00. She admits that these debts are outstanding but avers that she intends to pay one, is paying on two others, and disputes the 
fourth. No evidence was offered to prove those assertions but even assuming that the one disputed debt is not owed and that some payments have been made, 
the remaining debts exceed $4,000.00 according to her credit report. Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 26, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, </EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated February 12, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have her case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on May 25, 2004. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant did not respond and the case was assigned to me on July 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense contractor. She was arrested in 1995 and charged with credit card theft and pled 
guilty. She was sentenced to five years confinement suspended with three years supervised probation and a fine of $350. These facts were admitted but she 
offered some exculpatory explanations but without proof. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is also indebted to four creditors for a total amount of over $7,000.00. She admits that these debts are outstanding but avers that she intends to pay 
one, is paying on two others and disputes the fourth one. No evidence was offered to prove those assertions but even assuming the disputed debt is not owed 
and some payments have been made, the remaining debts still exceed $4,000.00 according to her credit report. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant holds a passport for a foreign country where she was born but cannot locate it and claims she would relinquish it if it could be found and has no intent 
to use it. The FORM concedes that issue and asks for a finding in favor of the Applicant on that allegation. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegations of criminal conduct raise a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J relating to a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses 
(E2.A10.1.2.2.) and allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.). While several 
mitigating  factors might be applicable if adequate evidence had been offered, the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 and the implementing regulations are 
unequivocal that an applicant is disqualified from holding a security clearance if convicted of a crime and sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment 
absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense. However, in view of my finding regarding financial considerations, no recommendation regarding a waiver is 
necessary. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts prompted the allegation in the SOR of violation of Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations 
(E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence of</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) include the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fact that the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has established reasons to deny her a security clearance because of criminal 
conduct. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates 
the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 
8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted to the Applicant to show that the mitigating conditions are applicable to her. She has failed to meet that burden. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I concur in the recommendation of Department Counsel in the FORM that the allegation relating to Guideline C be in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline J:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
