<P>Applicant is 38 years old, married with three children, and employed by a defense contractor  He has a 1999 court-martial conviction for assaulting his wife, 
and a 2000 civilian arrest for similar conduct, reduced to disorderly conduct.  Applicant gave false information about these incidents to investigators during his 
security clearance application process.  Applicant also has delinquent debts which he has not paid, even after his income increased substantially in the past three

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On October 9, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated December 4, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He did not request a hearing.  Later, Applicant 
submitted several extension requests to obtain legal counsel to advise him on a response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), which the Government sent 
to Applicant on January 24, 2003, on Applicant's non-hearing case.  Applicant requested a hearing on May 30, 2003.  </P> 
<P>This case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but reassigned to me on December 22, 2003 due to caseload considerations.  A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on February 3, 2004, setting the hearing for February 18, 2004.  Applicant received the Notice of Hearing on February 10, 2004.  I convened 
the hearing on that date to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented 
eight exhibits which were admitted into evidence.  Applicant appeared, testified, and submitted 18 exhibits, including three exhibits submitted after the hearing 
and to which Department Counsel had no objections<A HREF="01-26493.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>.  I received the transcript of the hearing on March 2, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government moved to amend the SOR in subparagraph 1.a. to delete "2001" and insert in its place "2000".  Applicant had no objection.  The motion was 
granted. (Tr. 152)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant denied the SOR allegations in Paragraph 1 (Guideline E).  He admitted the allegations in Paragraph 2 (Guideline J), except he never admitted nor 
denied subparagraph 2.c. that alleged his actions specified in Paragraph 1 violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.  He admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 3 a. through 
3.d., 3.f. through 3.h., and denied subparagraphs 3.e. and 3.i.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He is married and has three children.  Applicant formerly served in the Air Force until his 
discharge after his court-martial in 2000.  Applicant received an honorable discharge on January 22, 2000.  Applicant was an E-5, but the court-martial sentence 
reduced him to pay grade E-2. (Tr. 81, 85; Exhibits 1 at 4 and 5, 2, 8, and L) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was apprehended by military authorities in February 1999 for an incident of domestic violence with his spouse in their  residence on a military base at 
which Applicant was stationed at the time.  Applicant was tried at a special court-martial, and convicted in September 1999 on two specifications of assault and 
one of communicating a threat to his wife.  Applicant was sentenced to six months confinement and a reduction in grade from E-5 to E-2.  The reduction in 
grade reduced Applicant's income and thereby caused part of his financial problems involving unpaid bills.  Applicant reluctantly admits he assaulted and 
committed battery on his wife in that incident by hitting her in the head several times, grabbing her hair, and choking her.  His commander kept Applicant out 
of the marital home for several months until the court-martial occurred as a result of the incident. (Tr. 78, 79, 94, 101 to 107; Exhibits 4, 6, and 8)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested by civilian police authorities in October 2000 and charged with Assault and Domestic after his wife called police during an altercation 
they had after dinner.  Applicant's spouse had her wrist injured during the altercation, including having the skin broken.  Applicant later plead guilty 
todisorderly conduct, and he paid a fine of $75.00. (Tr. 78, 79, 101, 103; Exhibits 5, 7, S)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not fully disclose the full extent of the actions and injuries involved in his altercations with his spouse in two interviews with government 
investigators.  The interviews occurred in November 2000 and January 2001.  Applicant continued in the interviews to omit descriptions of his physical actions 
toward his spouse, and assert his spouse had mental and emotional problems which made her the aggressor in these situations.  Applicant admitted in a third 
interview in July 2001 that he was not truthful in the previous two interviews about the full extent of his actions in the two domestic altercations in 1999 and 
2000 because he was embarrassed.  Applicant did not disclose his 2000 domestic violence arrest upon the advice of his attorney that the case was not yet 
resolved so he should not disclose it. (Tr. 88 to 107, 135 to 137; Exhibits 4, 5, and 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has several delinquent debts.  He had a six month plan to pay off the bills in 2000, but only paid two of the nine debts.  In his Answer to the SOR in 
December 2002, Applicant stated he had a 12 month plan to pay all his past due bills in full.  At the hearing Applicant stated he would pay the debts listed in 
subparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., 3.d., and 3.h. that totaled $560 within 60 days.  Later he stated he would pay them in one year.  These are small debts which could have 
been paid before the hearing.  Applicant's salary has increased by $24,000 in three years, he has no credit cards at present, and rents a townhouse.  He has the 
disposable income to have paid these four delinquent and small denomination debts.  Applicant has paid two debts (subparagraphs 3.c. and 3.i. in full.  
Applicant's current status on the delinquent debts listed in the SOR are set forth in the chart below:(Tr. 60, 62, 66, 162; Exhibit 4 at 5; Answer at 5)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to the demotion he incurred resulting from his court-martial, his wife losing two jobs due to health problems in 
about 1997 and then in 2001.  Applicant does not have credit cards.  Applicant currently has one car, which he bought after another car was repossessed for 
non-payment (subparagraph 3.f.).  (Tr. 49, 61, 62) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has 17 employment evaluations from 1988 to 2003, all showing he meets or exceeds expectations and standards, including his military service 
evaluations.  Applicant also submitted character references from co-workers and superiors. (Exhibits N, O, P)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant completed a "Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program" in 1999 as a result of the domestic incident in February 1999.  Applicant 
submitted a report from 1999 of his spouse's social evaluation and reaction to the 1999 incident. (Exhibits A and B)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(A) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a 
personal security or trustworthiness determination.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; E2.A5.1.2.2 </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(6) A refusal to cooperate was based on advice from legal counsel or other officials</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">that the individual was not required to comply with security processing requirements and, upon being made aware of the requirement, fully and truthfully 
provided the requested information; E.2.A5.1.3.6</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(A) The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; E2.A10.1.2.1 </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. E2.A10.1.2.2</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) The criminal behavior was not recent. E2.A10.1.3.1</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.2.3</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.3.6</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, I draw only those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, I conclude the Government proved its case as Applicant deliberately stated in the official interview that he did not attempt to hurt 
his wife in 1999, but in fact he punched her in the back of the head, pulled her hair, and grabbed her neck.  He was convicted at a special court-martial in 1999 
of these acts and admitted the hair pulling at the hearing.  Applicant also admitted in a statement in July 2001 that he had not been truthful in the November 
2000 statement about what physical actions he perpetrated against his wife.  I find Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2 applies to subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR.  I 
do not find any (Mitigating Conditions) MC that apply to these allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR, I conclude the Government proved its case.  Applicant did assault his wife in 2000 and she was injured, as shown by 
the statement in Exhibit 7 from the police officer who responded to the telephone call from Applicant's wife.  This allegation pertains to a statement made by 
Applicant to an investigator in January 2001.  At that time the disorderly conduct charge was adjudicated in the state court, and the case concluded.  Applicant 
refers to his attorney in that statement, but Applicant's attempt to have MC 6 apply are not effective, because the issue is the veracity of his statements in 
January 2001, not at any time earlier.  Applicant also admitted in his July 2001 statement that he was not truthful about the actions he took against his wife in 
October 2000.  Therefore, I apply no MC on this allegation.  Consequently, I find against Applicant on Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government proved its case.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, 
reliability and trustworthiness.  A security concern arises and may be disqualifying in this case when there are allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person is formally charged, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1.  Also, DC 2 applies here, because a single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses has occurred.  This conclusion also applies to subparagraph 2.c. of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1 ( incident was not recent) applies here.  The arrests were five and four years ago.  There are no repeated offenses on record.  Applicant is employed and 
has taken counseling on marital dispute resolution.  His statements to the investigators were made three and four years ago, and are also mitigated for 
subparagraph 2.c.  Therefore, I find for Applicant on Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering Guideline F (Financial Considerations), I find DC 1 and DC 3 apply.  Applicant incurred these debts over the past seven years.  Seven of the nine 
debts alleged are small in amount, being less than $1000.  Applicant chose to pay off one debt for $541 in the past three years.  His large increase in salary over 
the past four years enabled him to pay the other small debts, but he did not do so.  He contests one debt, and has paid two debts (subparagraphs 3.c. and 3.i.), 
but the other debts remain unpaid with no persuasive reason for not doing so.  Applicant had since October 9, 2002, when the SOR was sent to him to pay the 
debts or arrange for installment payment plans.  He also obtained several extensions of time to file a response to FORM which was prepared initially when he 
did not request a hearing.  He has had two years to pay $560 from his $66,000 annual salary, at present, but did nothing.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had some financial downturns when he was demoted in the military as part of his court-marital sentence.  But since 1999 he has done better 
financially, including reducing his expenses for housing.  The hearing showed he has about a $1000 monthly with which to pay debts.  I conclude Applicant did 
not make good faith efforts to pay his debts in the past four years.  He has paid his current expenses for food, housing, clothing, etc.  But these debts from phone 
companies, credit purchases, and automobile purchases or leases have not been resolved.  He did pay two delinquent bills, and I give him credit for those 
payments.  Between his Answer, statement, and testimony at the hearing, he gave four different time periods within which the debts would be paid, but only two 
were paid.  Therefore, I do not apply any MC to this allegation.  I conclude against Applicant on Guideline F.</SPAN></P>
