<P>The Applicant sought and was granted political asylum in the U.S.  He was involved in the pro-democracy movement vis-a-vis the People's Republic of China 
(PRC).  His elderly parents, although  citizens of the PRC, reside in the U.S. with Applicant's naturalized American sister.  The Applicant's elderly mother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC, but resides much of the year in the U.S. with the Applicant and his wife.  His mother-in-law has permanent residency status.  The 
Applicant has little contact with his step-father-in-law, who is a citizen of and resides in the PRC.  The Applicant visited the PRC in 1996 to visit his parents.  
He plans no further visits to the PRC.  None of the Applicant's foreign relatives is connected with any foreign government or subject to coercion.  Mitigation is 
shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on June 28, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on August 24, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 9, 2005, and the case was heard on September 28, 
2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript 
(TR) was received on October 11, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Influence militates against the granting of a 
security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.d.  He denies subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c., as his mother 
resides in the U.S., and his father-in-law is deceased.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">44 years of age, has a 
Ph.D., and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant sought and was granted political asylum in the U.S. (TR at page 26 line 19 to page 28 line 12, and Applicant's Exhibits (AppXs) 6 and 7).  He 
was involved in the pro-democracy movement vis-a-vis the PRC (<EM>Id</EM>).  He came to the U.S. in 1986 to pursue his Master's and Ph.D. (AppXs 6 and 7).  He 
became a naturalized American in 1996, and has established a net worth in the U.S. of about $1,750,000 (TR at page 25 line 11 to page 26 line 18, and AppXs 4 
and 7).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.d.  The Applicant's elderly parents are  citizens of the PRC, but reside in the U.S. with Applicant's naturalized American sister (TR at page 18 line 25 to 
page 20 line 5, and AppX 1).  They are retired college professors (<EM>Id</EM>).  The Applicant's elderly mother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC, but resides much of the 
year in the U.S. with the Applicant and his wife (TR at page 21 line 13 to page 22 line 14, and AppX 2).  His mother-in-law is a retired factory worker, and has 
permanent residency status in the U.S. (<EM>Id</EM>).  The Applicant's father-in-law is deceased, and he  has little contact with his step-father-in-law, who is a citizen of 
and resides in the PRC (TR at page 22 line 23 to page </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">23 line 12, and AppX 3).  The Applicant visited the PRC in 1996 to visit his parents (TR at page 24 line 21 to page 25 line 10).  He plans no further visits to the 
PRC (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has the unqualified support of those who know and work with the Applicant (AppX 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant came to the U.S. in 1986 to pursue his Master's and Ph.D.  As he was involved in the pro-democracy movement, the Applicant sought and was 
granted political asylum in the U.S.  The Applicant's parent's, mother-in-law, and step-father-in-law are citizens of the PRC.  The first disqualifying condition 
under Foreign Influence is therefore applicable as "[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country."  However, the Applicant's parents 
and mother-in-law are permanent U.S. residents, and he has little contact with his step-father-in-law.  None of the Applicant's immediate family member is 
connected with any government, and there is no evidence that their presence in the U.S. or in the PRC can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I 
conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such attempt at exploitation (TR at page 28 line 13 to page 29 line 11).  The first 
mitigating condition is therefore applicable as "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States."  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline B is 
found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
