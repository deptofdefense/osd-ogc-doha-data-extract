<P>Applicant with the commission of regular marijuana use in college, which ceased after graduation, with the exception of an isolated recurrent recreation use in 
ay 2000, convinces that he has no need for the substance or any intention to use it again and mitigates the conduct covered in the SOR.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 10, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on November 26, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 7, 2001, 
and on December 13, 2001 was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on December 28, 2001, for the purpose of considering whether it would be 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 
two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on January 4, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the hearing, procedural issues arose over Applicant's real and present need for a security clearance and whether Applicant held a security clearance 
previously approved by the Treasury Department that followed an investigation into the same illegal drug- related issues as were raised in this clearance 
proceeding at DoD.  Resolution of these issues are necessary before proceeding to the merits of the proceeding, since they raise preliminary jurisdictional 
questions.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant satisfies by the letter supplied by his direct supervisor (<EM>see</EM> ex. A) that his employer has been the recipient of DoD contracts in the past covering 
network security vulnerability assessments (for which Applicant has been trained and promises to be a key player on future such projects), and by logical 
extension of its developed expertise and experience should be in line to receive future projects of a similar nature. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enough is shown herein to conclude that Applicant has a sufficient need for a security clearance to proceed to resolving the second presented procedural issue 
herein: Whether the security clearance Applicant applied for with the Treasury Department in September 2000 and subsequently investigated involved the same 
or lesser scope of investigation as did his more recent application for a top secret clearance with DoD.  If so, he would be entitled to reciprocity and clearance 
herein on his DoD application on the strength of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), Section 2-203, since Applicant's same 
disclosed marijuana use was presumptively investigated by Treasury and mitigated when it granted him a clearance.  Section 2-203's reciprocal recognition of 
other agencies' clearance grants based on a similar investigation is conditioned on a showing that the current investigation does not exceed the scope of the 
prior investigation that produced the earlier agency clearance grant.  Because Applicant's top secret clearance application with DoD exceeds the scope of the 
clearance sought with his earlier Treasury application, Section 2-203 reciprocity requirements are neither triggered nor applicable here.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supporting submission, which includes both his unsigned and signed January 11, 2002 letter from his superior, is admitted as exhibit A.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jurisdiction established with the settling of preliminary issues covering Applicant's demonstrated need for a security clearance and potential reciprocal 
entitlement arising out of Applicant's previously approved Treasury clearance, this case will proceed to the merits of the illegal substance issues raised in the 
SOR and answer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 24-year old network security specialist for a major accounting firm with ongoing defense work with DoD that requires his holding a security 
clearance at the top secret level for the work responsibilities he will be tasked to do.  He establishes a need for a clearance to work on contracts his employer 
either has with DoD or stands to obtain (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  He previously held a security clearance while working for his current defense contractor on a contract 
requiring a clearance with the Treasury Department, albeit not at the same scope (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have (a) smoked marijuana from September 1996 to May 2000 and (b) used marijuana in part during a period after he had completed his 
application for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted smoking marijuana from September 1996 to May 2000, and doing so in part after he had completed a security 
clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Appellant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his sophomore and junior years in college, Applicant used marijuana infrequently: roughly every two to three months in social situations, fifteen times 
total. He has never sold or purchased the substance, or been involved in any confrontations with law enforcement over possession.  He admits to knowing 
marijuana use was illegal when he used it.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant came to recognize his use of marijuana was a mistake and quit using it his senior year in college, with his last college use coming in the Fall of his 
senior year to the best of his recollection (<EM>i.e., </EM>in October 1998).  He never felt any urge to get "high" on the substance, and usually used it in combination with 
alcohol, although his use was never influenced by alcohol (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 65-66).  After a considerable hiatus from any marijuana use, he tried it once again while 
on vacation with old college friends in May 2000 (<EM>compare</EM> ex. 2 with R.T., at 57-62).  At the time of his slip, he had a security clearance application pending 
and was keenly aware that drug use of any kind was not only illegal, but against official DoD policy.  When asked about his future intentions by an interviewing 
DSS agent in August 2000, he assured he had no intention of using marijuana in the future (ex. 2).  He has kept to his word on this stated intention and averted 
any recurrent marijuana use since his last use in May 2000, even when he associates with old friends who still occasionally smoke the substance (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 
62).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be sure, Applicant does not rule out the possibility of his trying marijuana at some time in the future, should he return to college for any reason,  but believes 
he has learned his lesson and does not want to make another mistake by using marijuana again (R.T., at 65-70).   Applicant's assurances of his having no 
intention to return to marijuana use in the future are backed by his avoidance of recurrent use since 1998, save for his one slip in May 2000, and by overall 
demonstrated maturity and responsibility with his current employer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to be well regarded by his employer who has put him in for a security clearance and exhibits considerable candor and responsibility, both 
with his employer and with his personal affairs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Any drug use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1  The drug involvement was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3  A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a well regarded network security specialist, who over a two-year stretch during his sophomore and junior years in college used marijuana 
occasionally in social situations: some fifteen times altogether.  Except for an isolated slip while on vacation with his old college friends in May 2000, he has 
never used marijuana, or any drug, since college.  What adds to the security significance of his 2000 slip is his pending security clearance application and 
knowledge that drug use was not only illegal but against DoD policy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to fully abstain from marijuana use after accepting a new position with his current employer and initiating a security clearance application 
was not the result of any deliberate disregard on his part of existing DoD drug policy strictures, however, but rather the direct consequence of his being around  
individuals he generally doesn't associate with (<EM>viz., </EM>his old college friends), while vacationing.  The incident has matured him even more: to the point now 
(over eighteen months since his last slip) where he insists he will not use marijuana again, and potentially jeopardize his clearance and job.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Whether or not Applicant can consistently refrain from active marijuana involvement and/or use of other illegal substances in the foreseeable future remains the 
principal security concern.  For Applicant to fully mitigate his occasionally revisited marijuana use, he necessarily needs to demonstrate a seasoned  intention 
not to abuse marijuana in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To help him make the convincing showing that he should be trusted on his hearing assurances that he will never use marijuana or other illegal substances as 
long as he holds a security clearance, Applicant places great stress on his highly valued work, his maturity and understanding of how marijuana use and 
clearance access do not mix.  Applicant's management support for his role in network security projects that require a clearance is certainly a favorable 
consideration to factor into a whole person evaluation of his drug-free commitments.  But it is not dispositive either.  Our Appeal Board has consistently drawn 
bright distinctions between an applicant's value to his employer (as Applicant most certainly is considered by his supervisors and colleagues) and his eligibility 
to be cleared to access classified defense information.   <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0370 (January 28, 1999); ISCR Case No. 96-0710 (June 20, 1997).   
Predictability judgments about an applicant's likelihood to return to drugs are more heavily weighted by the applicant's prior substance abuse history and the 
amount of seasoning that has occurred since discontinued usage.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both Applicant's history and his currently expressed intentions to avert marijuana in the future, when coupled with the  trust he engenders in his professional 
efforts to date, are sufficient  to absolve him under the facts of this evidentiary record of still active security concerns about his marijuana use.  With almost 
eighteen months of sustained abstinence, he exhibits the seasoning to surmount any doubts about his ability to avoid recurrent use in the foreseeable future.  
Both his exhibited abstinence and his sustained commitments not to return to drug use since his first and only slip in May 2000 enable him to take full 
advantage of two of the mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs: MC1 (non-recency) and MC 3 (demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs 
in the future) are all available to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Considering Applicant's overall record, the circumstances of his use of marijuana in college,  the seasoning that has occurred since his last slip in May 2000, 
and his convincing showing of his intention not to resort to illegal drugs in the future, Applicant is absolved of any risks of recurrent illegal drug involvement at 
this time.  Favorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of Guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS listed above, 
this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P>
