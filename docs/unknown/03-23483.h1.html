His last period

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 9, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 4, 2005, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. This case was 
assigned to me on November 25, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 23, 2006, setting the hearing for March 6, 2006. The transcript was received at DOHA on 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. The SOR contains ten (10) allegations under Guideline H (Drugs).  In his response, Applicant admits all SOR allegations and adds an 
overall explanation.  The factual admissions are accepted and incorporated as Findings of Fact.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence of record, I make the following Findings of Fact as to each SOR allegation:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline H (Drugs)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - Applicant used marijuana , with varying frequency, at times daily, from about 1975 to late 1989, and then again from April 2002 to at least December 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. - Applicant tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test conducted by his employer on December 20, 2002. He was suspended for one week without pay and referred to his 
company's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) office.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. - Applicant was evaluated for Substance Abuse by an EAP counselor and attended four EAP sessions in January 2003.  You were referred for extensive outpatient substance abuse counseling. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. - You received treatment from February 13, 2003 to April 10, 2003 for a condition described as cannabis dependence. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. - Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted a DoD security clearance on June 17, 2000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. - Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) by another Government agency. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. - Applicant's SCI access was revoked on February 19, 2003, based on his positive drug test as cited in 1.b., above.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. - Applicant continued to use marijuana after he signed a document on August 16, 2001 in which he acknowledged that unlawful use of any narcotic substance, marijuana, or dangerous drugs 
may result in the removal of his SCI access.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i. - Applicant received two citations between the late 1970s and early 1980s for Possession of marijuana. He was fined on both occasions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.j. - Applicant used cocaine approximately six times while in college (September 1976 to June 1981). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the 
presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood 
of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it 
is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance. An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having 
to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts 
alleged in the Statement of Reasons. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it 
is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer (born in March 1958). He has been a licensed engineer for about 25 years (Tr at 28). He admits all ten suballegations, and adds comments in mitigation. 
Applicant has used marijuana (and occasionally cocaine) over 14 years from 1975 to 1989 and again from April 2002 to at least December 2002, during which latter time his admitted use of 
marijuana was "daily," except "for July and August" (GX at page 2). His last use of record occurred shortly before he tested positive for marijuana on a random drug screening in December 2002, 
which was a little more than thee years prior to the March 6, 2006 hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The August 5, 2003 medical report views Applicant as "very responsive to treatment goals and sought additional knowledge through bibliotherapy" [reading a book or article and becoming involved 
with the characters and ideas therein] and states that his "prognosis is good" (<EM>Id</EM>.). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am required to predict the risk of future misconduct based substantially on past conduct, current statements, and demonstrated rehabilitation of both thinking and conduct. This record compels the 
initial conclusion that Applicant's cessation of marijuana was not voluntary and would likely have continued for some unknown period, but for the December 2006 drug screening and positive for 
marijuana test result. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The next question is whether he has demonstrated such rehabilitation. My evaluation must first decide whether the apparent lack of drug use over the past two years reflects a basic change in both 
outlook and conduct or is simply a response to the pressure of the ongoing adjudicative process. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant points out that he "satisfactorily" completed outpatient treatment in May 2003 (GX 6). A 
letter from the drug counseling agency, dated October 2, 2003 (AX B), relates Applicant's 2003 marijuana use to "marital conflict." The author of the letter does "not assess [Applicant] as at risk for 
substance abuse. He has shown strength and willingness to grow that go far beyond that of a 'dependent' personality. In fact, I se [Applicant] as blossoming into a leader. . . . [Applicant] is a man of 
strength who can be trusted to remain consistently responsible" (<EM>Id</EM>.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The writer of a second letter (AX C) was a counselor who met Applicant during the 2003 treatment program. The writer, who has 13 years in the field, has gone on to open two drug and alcohol 
treatment centers in their mutual home area. Their paths have crossed again in their private lives, and the writer has been greatly impressed by Applicant's maturity and contributions to his 
community (see, also AX E). A third writer, a clergyman who also holds a Master's Degree in Psychology, has known Applicant for some year and believes he has "the inner strength of character 
that is necessary to give a favorable prognosis for his complete recovery" (AX D) (<EM>see, also</EM>, Tr at 29-31). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant continues to attend meetings of a "12-step group" and has learned the hard consequences of self medicating to kill the pain of his marital problems and father's terminal illness and death 
(Tr at 28 -30). He has taken four drug screening tests between November 2005 and February 2006, all of which produced negative results. These results are helpful, but not highly probative on the 
issue of Applicant's overall rehabilitation since they occurred during the current investigation and adjudication and do not necessarily reflect a voluntary change in Applicant's thought processes. He 
also states a willingness to undergo a lie detector test in order to verify his sincerity. However, under the DOHA adjudication process, my decision must be based on the evidence in existence at the 
closing of the record and, in any case, by official DoD policy, "lie detector" results are generally not admissible. Applicant stresses the "importance" of his work (Tr at 31), but that point is not 
relevant to the issue of whether he is eligible or not. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The facts of record relating to his marijuana use are that are of special concern include: (1) when confronted by his company about the positive drug test result, he initially denied he had used 
marijuana and admitted it only later (GX at page 6). Considering the extent of his marijuana use, the test result cannot have been a surprise to him.  His extensive marijuana use in 2003 occurred (2) 
several years after he had received a DoD security clearance in June 2000; (3) after he had received SCI access; and (4) after he signed a document on August 16, 2001 acknowledging that his 
unlawful use of any narcotic substance, marijuana, or controlled substance may result in the removal of his Special Security Access. His defense, in general, is that he was "not thinking clearly" at 
the time because of his depression (Tr at 33). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's early drug use (marijuana and cocaine) occurred from ages 17-22. He used marijuana on a social basis about once a week, by himself and with friends (Tr at 40). He used cocaine about 
six times during the same period (Tr at 42, 43). He began using marijuana again in April 2002, while vacationing in Hawaii (Tr at 45, 46). He used it daily between mid-April and the end of May, 
when he stopped because he feared the consequences (Tr at 48). He used it once again after Thanksgiving 2002 (Tr at 46). It was apparently this use that was detected during the random drug 
screening. His father's cancer was detected in 2001 and his final deterioration began in early 2002 (Tr at 47). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no real question about the extent of Applicant's drug use.  However, the last use of record occurred more than three years ago, and the ultimate question is whether Applicant has 
demonstrated rehabilitation or is simply in an interim period before using again.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Conditions (DC) (1) - any drug abuse and (2) illegal drug possession are applicable. Mitigating Condition (MC) (1) is applicable as the last use /is still "recent." MC (2) is applicable, 
at least in part, since the drug use, although not isolated, was "infrequent." In context however, this factor, by itself, is not enough to outweigh the Government's negative evidence. Last, MC (3) is 
not applicable, since Applicant has not yet demonstrated "an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Concern: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.   Drug abuse or dependence may 
impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P>

dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program, are all shown by the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">               Mitigating Conditions: (1) The drug involvement was not recent; (3) he has demonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future; and (4) he has satisfactorily completed of a 
prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and he has received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical 
professional.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">           As to the question of whether Applicant has adequately demonstrated rehabilitation, I conclude that he has done so.  While any drug involvement is unacceptable in someone seeking a 
security clearance, the ultimate issue is not one of punishment but of the likelihood of unacceptable future conduct.  As I evaluate the evidence, the last three years of Applicant's life have been 
substantially positive.  In the context of eight months of marijuana use in 2002 and a  prior use more 14 years earlier, his use of marijuana in 2002 is deemed to be no longer "recent."  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">               The Government is certainly correct in its concerns about the issue of Applicant's drug on his eligibility for a security clearance.  The fact of Applicant's history of drug use is made even 
more serious by his using marijuana after receiving a security clearance, access to SCI material, and signing a document acknowledging his understanding of DoD policy against such drug use.  
Without substantial mitigation, the exercise of such poor judgment and lack of self control in the past would almost certainly make him ineligible for a security clearance under Directive 5220.6.  
However, under the specific facts and circumstances shown by the record, Applicant has overcome the evidence supporting the SOR by recent positive conduct, the passage of time, and the opinion 
of mental health professionals.  I conclude he has demonstrated that he currently possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets. </SPAN></P>
