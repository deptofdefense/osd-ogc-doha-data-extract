<P>As a divorced single mother with two young children, Applicant encountered financial problems which led to Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 1995. In 2003, she encountered financial problems again 
after an automobile accident prevented her from working for one year. She incurred 14 delinquent debts totaling $12,211.  Applicant's step-father helped her with her financial affairs.  She has paid 
off most of the debt. The debts remaining are medical accounts where the creditor was not identified on the credit report and could not be located. She made a good faith effort to resolve her 
accounts. The omission of her delinquent debts on her trustworthiness application was not intentional.  She has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and

<P>On September 29, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-04774.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On August 24, 2006,

and transferred to me on October 20, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on November 3, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>November 29, 2006. Due to a scheduling conflict for Applicant's counsel, 
the hearing was continued to December 5, 2006, and<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was conducted on that date. The government submitted Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-5 which were admitted into the record without 
objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one witness and submitted one exhibit with subparagraphs 1-11 which was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted without 
objection.  </SPAN>The record was held open until December 19, 2006, to allow Applicant to submit further documents.  A ten page document was submitted on December 7, 2006, marked as AE B, and 
admitted without objection. A nine page document was received on December 14, 2006, marked as AE C, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 
13, 2006.</P>

Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Guideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations, and 
Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant first experienced financial difficulty in 1995 which resulted in her filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  She encountered additional 
financial problems around 2003 after a car accident prevented her from working for a year. The SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $12,211.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).   I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>), since she experienced financial troubles over the past 
few years.  I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) due to her prior history of financial responsibility, including the 1995 bankruptcy and her most recent financial problems.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies.  Applicant's 1995 bankruptcy was the result of a divorce and her struggle adjusting to taking care of  her two children on her own. After her bankruptcy, her 
finances were under control for a period of seven years.  In late 2002, she was injured in a car accident which prevented her from working for a year.  Financial problems occurred as a result of her 
inability to work. Conditions beyond Applicant's control contributed to both periods of financial instability.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply only 
with respect to the fact that Applicant has not received any formal financial counseling.  I do note  that her financial problems now appear to be under control.  Applicant lives within her means and 
has resolved most of her delinquent accounts. The only accounts that have not been resolved are accounts where she and her step-father have been unsuccessful in locating the creditor.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's step-father was a big facilitator in resolving Applicant's accounts.  One might question her ability to handle her finances on her own.  I believe she can.  She is cautious about her spending 
habits.  She was financially stable for a period of over seven years after her bankruptcy discharge in 1995. In 2003, she recognized that she needed help with her finances and sought the assistance of 
her mother and step-father.  The accounts were resolved using her money.  Her step-father helped organize her financial situation.  He essentially did what most credit counseling agencies would have 
done for Applicant.  </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies.  Applicant resolved six of the delinquent accounts. The total approximate 
balance of these delinquent accounts on the SOR was $11,151.  Seven accounts remain unresolved, an approximate total of $1,050. Applicant and her step-father were proactive in trying to locate 
these accounts.  They are all medical accounts.  The evidence supporting these accounts are entries on Applicant's credit report indicating that she owes these "medical accounts."  The entries are too 
vague and do not give Applicant adequate notice as to the exact name of the creditor.  Regardless, Applicant and her step-father attempted to locate these accounts and have paid three other medical 
accounts which may or may not related to the medical accounts listed in the SOR. If they successfully locate these creditors, Applicant is able to pay the accounts.  Adequate attempts have been made 
to locate these creditors and Applicant has demonstrated a good faith effort to resolve her delinquent accounts. She has resolved a large majority of debt balance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has  mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a 
security clearance, trustworthiness position, or other official matters is a concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant explained that she did not list her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on the public trust application because she was not aware of the delinquent debt. Her step-father 
had been helping with her finances since 2003. He testified that he was unaware of these delinquent accounts. I find both Applicant and her step-father's testimony credible.  I find Applicant did not 
intentionally falsify her trustworthiness application. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the 
"whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. Applicant took the initiative to resolve her financial problems even prior to applying for her 
trustworthiness position. She resolved the accounts where the creditors were able to be located.  She was not aware that she had delinquent accounts when she filled out her trustworthiness 
application. Her proactive attempts to resolve her accounts with the help of her step-father and the favorable recommendations from her friends and co-workers mitigate the trustworthiness concerns 
raised in her background investigation. Based on the evidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is 
granted.</P>
