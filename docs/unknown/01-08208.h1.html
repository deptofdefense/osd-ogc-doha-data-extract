<P>Applicant's marijuana use stopped one year before close of the record.  Use happened between ages of 17 and 22.  Applicant has matured and evinces credible

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 10, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 6, 2001, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on January 9, 2002.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents 
in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on January 25, 2002, and submitted a response on February 15, 2002</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The 
Department Counsel did not object to the admissibility of the additional material.  The case was received by the undersigned on February 26, 2002.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 23, single and has a bachelor's degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Buyer, and he seeks to obtain or retain a DoD security 
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant first began using marijuana in approximately 1995, when he was 16.  From September 1997 to June 1998 the Applicant used marijuana 
approximately twice a week.  From July 1998 to December 1999 the Applicant used marijuana about monthly.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 1-2.)  He used 
marijuana two or three times in the year 2000.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 1-2.)  He stopped using marijuana in January 2001, a year before the record closed.  
He expresses a credible intent not to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.  (Applicant's "Response to File of Relevant Material Submitted by 
Department Counsel.")</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted using psychedelic mushrooms once in May 1998.  He has not used them since that time and evinces a credible intent not to use them in 
the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used marijuana from 1996 to January 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The unrebutted evidence shows that the Applicant stopped using 
marijuana a year before the record closed.  He stated that in January 2001, as he entered his last semester of college, and signed his last sworn statement, "I 
realized it was time for a change in my life and it was time to stop using drugs."  (Applicant's "Response to File of Relevant Material Submitted by Department 
Counsel.")  In addition, the evidence shows that his marijuana use had been steadily decreasing before stopping entirely in January 2001. He has been 
continually open and honest with the Government concerning his marijuana use.  Accordingly, his statements concerning his future intentions are accorded due 
weight.  The Applicant was a very young man throughout the time of his drug use.  His heaviest use came when he was 18 and 19, which is when he used 
mushrooms for the only time.  His written answers and statements show a young man who is truthful, maturing and understands his responsibilities as a 
clearance holder.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, the likelihood  of recurrence is virtually nil.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to subparagraph 1.d., the Applicant is not a current user of illegal drugs.  Accordingly, I find that the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 do not apply to this 
case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
