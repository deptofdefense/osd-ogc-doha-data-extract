<P>Applicant failed to demonstrate that her family members living in Laos were not agents of a foreign government or so situated as to provide a point of influence 
on Applicant, thus failing to mitigate the foreign influence concerns. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 29 March 2006, the Appeal Board remanded this case to me "for the purpose of locating the [<EM>U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human 
Rights and Labor, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Laos, dated <STRONG>23<A HREF="02-24875.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></STRONG> February 2001</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">] and making it part of the rec</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ord." The Appeal Board 
concluded that I erred by not including the report in the record forwarded on appeal. As directed, I have attached the requested report to this decision (Tab A). 
In addition, to complete the record, I have attached copies of the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: Laos, 
dated November 2003 </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet: Laos, dated 30 December 2003</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Tab B), 
both of which were officially noticed at the hearing but missing from the case file forwarded to the Appeal Board.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-24875.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DISCUSSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One aspect of the Appeal Board remand that must be addressed is the conclusion that a publication officially noticed over the objection of one of the parties 
must have hard copy included in the record of trial. The Appeal Board's conclusion ignores an essential component of official notice: that adjudicative facts 
may be noticed when they are capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. In other words, 
you could look it up. The noticed State Department publications are well within this requirement. Although I was not required to take official notice of these 
publications, it was well within my discretion to do so. Further, while Department Counsel provided hard copy to me and Applicant as a matter of convenience, 
hard copies were not required for me to take official notice. I could have as easily and properly taken official notice of these publications with only a citation to 
their locations, whether physically in a library or in an agency on-line reading room. For clarity, I attach a "screen shot" of the State Department's access page 
to its major reports--notably including human rights reports from 1993-2005 (Tab C). I can easily access and print same report I officially noticed (Tab D) 
varying only in the number of printed pages. Thus, any interested party can--working from the cite I gave in the record (Tr. 15)--locate the publication that I 
noticed. Another important component of official notice is the ability to take official notice at any time in the proceeding, whether requested or not. Addressing 
Applicant's issue that I should not have taken official notice of the 2000 human rights report because it was irrelevant because outdated, I take official notice 
that the section of the 2000 Human Rights Report upon which I largely based my three-sentence finding about the government of Laos--section 1.f. Arbitrary 
Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence--remains essentially unchanged in subsequent reports through 2005. (See, Tab C)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board remand requires no change to my Findings of Fact, Policies, Conclusions, or Formal Findings. Accordingly, there is no reason to change my 
decision.</SPAN></P>
