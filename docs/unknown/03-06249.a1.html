<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On January 10, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 30, 2005, after the 
hearing, Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding the security concerns raised under Guidelines F and J had 
not been mitigated.<A HREF="03-06249.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in his characterization and weighing of Applicant's mitigating evidence.  Absent that error, Applicant 
would have been entitled to a favorable clearance decision.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, 
the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge found Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of financial difficulties which included the nonpayment of debts and 
the failure to file Federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003.  The Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the 
mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant 
mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to some of the allegations.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not 
favorably applying any mitigating conditions to the remainder of the allegations, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented 
in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable 
clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
