  Department Counsel does not have the burden of presenting direct or objective evidence of a nexus between an applicant's conduct and circumstances and an unfavorable security clearance decision.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge had to evaluate the security  significance of the totality of Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts, not just each one separately.  There is a rational connection between terrorism  and security clearance adjudications.  A credibility determination does not relieve a Judge from the obligation to weigh the evidence as a whole.  For  various reasons, it is neither legally required under the Directive nor practical for the Board to ensure consistency among Hearing Office decisions.   Applicant has not shown that the Judge's conclusions under Guideline B are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 31, 2003, which stated the 
reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence).  Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated April 21, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether Department Counsel failed to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case against Applicant that 
supported the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding certain matters 
raised security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence); (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant did not mitigate the 
security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence); and (4) whether the Administrative Judge failed to evaluate Applicant's security 
eligibility under the whole person concept.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify 
how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 
00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or 
(2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary 
or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it 
reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the 
record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) 
at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether 
they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not 
required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are 
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect 
a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party 
challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 
4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact about his ties and contacts with immediate family members and in-laws who are citizens and residents of Pakistan.  However, Applicant does raise various challenges to the conclusions that the Judge reached about his 
family ties and contacts.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Department Counsel failed to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case against Applicant that supported the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security 
clearance decision</SPAN>.  Applicant argues Department Counsel "failed to submit any evidence into the record that meets [its] burden" of establishing a 
<EM>prima facie</EM> case against Applicant.  This claim of error is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to prove controverted SOR allegations.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel does not have the burden 
of presenting direct or objective evidence of a nexus between an applicant's conduct and circumstances and an unfavorable security clearance 
decision.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In this case, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for concluding Department Counsel had presented sufficient evidence concerning 
Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts to meet its burden of establishing a <EM>prima facie</EM> case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), thereby shifting 
the burden of persuasion to Applicant to present evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised under that Guideline.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding certain matters raised security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  Applicant 
makes five arguments that the Board construe as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that certain matters raise 
security concerns under Guideline B.  Specifically, Applicant argues: (a) the Administrative Judge did not have a rational basis for concluding 
Applicant's family ties in Pakistan raise security concerns under Guideline B; (b) the Judge erred by concluding Applicant's giving of annual gifts of 
money ($300-$600) constituted financial support and contributed to Applicant being vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign 
government; (c) the Judge erred by concluding that the livelihood of Applicant's brother raises a security concern under Guideline B; (d) it was 
arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to conclude the fragile health of Applicant's father and father-in-law increases the security concerns under 
Guideline B; and (e) there is no rational connection between terrorism and the adjudication of Applicant's security clearance case.  With one exception 
that constitutes harmless error, Applicant's claims are not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The main thrust of the first three arguments is that the Administrative Judge erred by not viewing Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts separately 
and reaching a conclusion as to the security significance of each one in isolation.  Under the whole person concept,<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> the Judge had to evaluate the 
security significance of the totality of Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts, not just each one separately.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant is not entitled to have the 
Judge engage in a piecemeal analysis of his family ties and foreign contacts.  The Board need not decide whether the Judge could have concluded that 
each family tie or foreign contact involved in Applicant's case --  standing alone -- was sufficient to raise security concerns under Guideline B.  All the 
Board must do is decide whether there is sufficient record evidence to allow the Judge to reasonably infer or conclude that the totality of Applicant's 
family ties and foreign contacts raise security concerns under Guideline B.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge had a rational basis for 
concluding that the totality of Applicant's ties with immediate family members and in-laws in Pakistan raised security concerns under Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P>The Board finds persuasive Applicant's argument that the Administrative Judge erred by concluding the fragile health of Applicant's father and father-in-law increased the security concerns under Guideline B.  The Judge articulated no rational basis for her conclusion on this point, and it is not obvious 
or self-evident from the record evidence concerning the health status of Applicant's father and father-in-law why the Judge reached her challenged 
conclusion on this point.  However, considering the record as a whole, this error is harmless.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument that terrorism has no rational connection to a security clearance adjudication is not persuasive.  As noted earlier in this decision, 
Department Counsel does not have to present direct or objective evidence of a nexus.  Moreover, Applicant's argument goes too far by asserting that 
the existence of terrorism is irrelevant to the adjudication of security clearance cases.  Contrary to Applicant's assertion, it is possible to envision 
several ways in which terrorists could pose a threat to classified information.  Terrorists can be expected to try to harm the United States, directly or 
indirectly.  There is no reason to expect such terrorists would ignore opportunities to attack United States interests, directly or indirectly.  If terrorists 
had an opportunity to hurt the United States by obtaining classified information, there is no good reason to expect they would simply ignore such an 
opportunity.  Terrorists could try to compromise classified U.S. information to gain information that could be of operational benefit to them (<EM>e.g.</EM>, gain 
insight into sensitive military technology that they could exploit directly against the U.S. military or civilian targets, or use such access to try to develop 
countermeasures to help themselves on a tactical level when conducting their terrorist operations and related activities).  Similarly, terrorists could 
reveal to other adversaries of the United States classified information that they cannot exploit themselves, so that those other adversaries could exploit it 
to the detriment of the United States.  Furthermore, terrorists need to obtain funding for their operations.  Terrorists have engaged in theft, drug dealing, 
and other illegal activities to obtain funding.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Classified  information could have value to foreign countries willing to pay for it.  Terrorists could try to 
gain access to classified U.S. information in order to sell it to the highest bidder.  There is no good reason to assume that terrorists would overlook an 
opportunity to obtain classified information for sale to the highest bidder as a means of obtaining funding for their terrorist activities.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  For all these 
reasons, the Board concludes it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to take into account that there are individuals and groups 
in Pakistan who have acted and continue to act in a manner that is hostile to U.S. security interests.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  
Applicant raises several arguments that the Board construes as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant did 
not mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline B.  Specifically, Applicant argues: (a) the Judge erred by not giving more weight to her 
favorable credibility determination; (b)  the Judge made a foreign policy assessment concerning Pakistan that is not supported by the record evidence 
and is contrary to official Executive Branch statements about U.S.-Pakistan cooperation;  (c) the Judge erred by not applying Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 1; (d) the Judge erred by concluding Applicant's relationship with his father and father-in-law is not casual and infrequent; (e) the 
Judge failed to give due weight to the "clear evidence of mitigation" he presented.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant conflates a credibility determination with record evidence, and seeks to elevate Applicant's statements to status of binding or conclusive 
evidence.  A credibility determination -- whether favorable or unfavorable -- is not a substitute for record evidence.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Even if an Administrative Judge 
concludes that an applicant's testimony is credible, that does not mean that the Judge must accept that testimony uncritically without regard to 
considering and weighing that testimony in light of the record as a whole.  A credibility determination does not relieve a Judge from the obligation to 
weigh the evidence as a whole and reach reasonable conclusions from the record as a whole.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Even if the Judge concluded Applicant had testified 
honestly and sincerely, the Judge would still have to consider and weigh Applicant's testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole when assessing 
the security significance of the evidence concerning Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, Applicant's credibility argument does 
not demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes that DOHA proceedings are not intended to adjudicate foreign policy issues committed to other parts of the federal 
government.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Moreover, Applicant correctly notes that decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges are not legally binding precedent and can 
only be cited as persuasive authority.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant then proceeds to argue that the Board should follow the views of Hearing Office 
Administrative Judges who have reached conclusions about Pakistan that are favorable to Applicant,<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> despite his candid acknowledgment that some 
Hearing Office Judges in other cases have reached conclusions about Pakistan that are not favorable to him.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant offers no cogent reason why 
the Board should follow one set of Hearing Office decisions over the other set of Hearing Office decisions.  Applicant's argument does not 
demonstrate the Judge committed error in this case.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument concerning Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> is not persuasive.  As noted earlier in this decision, the Administrative 
Judge had a rational basis for concluding Department Counsel presented sufficient evidence concerning Applicant's family ties and foreign contacts to 
meet its burden of establishing a <EM>prima facie</EM> case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), thereby shifting the burden of persuasion to Applicant to 
present evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised under that Guideline.  Applicant's burden of persuasion included 
presenting sufficient evidence to warrant application of pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  The Judge concluded Applicant did 
not present sufficient record evidence to warrant application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  There is no presumption of error below, and 
an appealing party has the burden of showing error below.  Applicant's argument that the Judge erred by not applying Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1 reduces to a disagreement with the Administrative Judge's conclusion that the record evidence does not warrant application of Foreign 
Influence Mitigating Condition 1, without any cogent argument or reason for how or why the Judge's conclusion is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.  Applicant's argument falls short of meeting his burden of persuasion on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument concerning the nature of his relationship with his father and his father-in-law fails to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  
To a large extent, Applicant bases his argument on decisions by Hearing Office Judges in other cases.  As discussed earlier in this decision, such 
decisions are not legally binding precedent.  Applicant has not presented a cogent argument for why the Board should follow the Hearing Office 
decisions he relies on in support of this claim of error.  There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members are not casual in 
nature.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant may have ties of affection for, or obligation to, the parents of the applicant's 
spouse.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's 
contacts with his father and father-in-law in Pakistan were not casual or infrequent.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to evaluate Applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the 
Administrative Judge did not apply the whole person concept, arguing that: (a) the Judge did not weigh the record evidence properly; (b) Applicant's 
testimony was truthful; (c) Applicant testified that there is "zero possibility" of any security compromise; and (d) Applicant's need for a security 
clearance is limited to access to secure areas only, not access to classified information itself.  These arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>(a) Applicant disagrees with the Administrative Judge's weighing of the record evidence, but fails to articulate a cogent argument or reason why the 
Judge's weighing of the evidence was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Standing alone, Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of 
the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when weighing the 
record evidence.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>(b) The argument is a variation of Applicant's conflating credibility with weight of the record evidence.  Even if the Administrative Judge concluded 
Applicant's testimony was truthful, such a conclusion would not compel the Judge to find in Applicant's favor.  Moreover, Applicant's testimony is 
relevant evidence, but it is not binding, conclusive or dispositive under the whole person concept. </P> 
 
<P>(c) Applicant's opinion about the security significance of his conduct and circumstances is not binding or conclusive on the Administrative Judge.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  
The Judge was not required to accept Applicant's opinion or use it as the basis for her security clearance decision.  Moreover, Applicant's statement 
that "the basis for Judge Anthony's decision is a mystery" is not an argument that demonstrates error below.  Acceptance of Applicant's argument 
about the significance of his opinion would lead to the untenable result that the federal government would not be able to deny or revoke a security 
clearance unless an applicant affirmatively concedes that he or she poses a security risk.</P> 
 
<P>(d) Applicant's limited need for access is irrelevant.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard applies whether an applicant needs a 
security clearance for access to classified information or for access to a secure area.<A HREF="02-29403.a1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  The security concerns raised under Guideline B in this case do 
not turn on whether Applicant needs access to secure areas only or access to classified information itself.</P>

<P>Applicant claims on appeal that there was no evidence presented to show a terrorist threat to U.S. classified information and that such a threat runs 
contrary to common sense or human experience.  I think Applicant's claims are frivolous.  Furthermore, the terms of the Directive clearly raise the 
government's concerns about an applicant's foreign ties even where there are no questions of terrorism.  The government is not obligated to present 
evidence to prove that the Directive is justified.</P>

that are not challenged on appeal are not proper subjects for review by the Board.  In view of the foregoing, it is neither legally required under the 
Directive nor practical for the Board to undertake the task Applicant asks it to assume. 
<P><A NAME="N_15_">15. </A> Applicant's acknowledgment of Hearing Office decisions that run contrary to his position reflects a proper recognition of his professional 
obligations to this tribunal, which the Board appreciates. 
<P><A NAME="N_16_">16. </A> Implicit in Applicant's arguments is the premise that countries that are not openly hostile to the United States, or which do not have interests inimical 
to the United States, cannot pose a risk to the security of classified information under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  That premise is not warranted.  
The United States is entitled to protect classified information from any person, entity, or country not authorized to have access to such information, not 
just those that are hostile to the United States or have interests inimical to the United States.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-26976 (October 22, 2004)
