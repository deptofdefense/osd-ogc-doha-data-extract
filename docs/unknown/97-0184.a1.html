<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Larry H. Layton, Esq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross issued a decision, dated February 11, 1998, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.  The Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing consistent with the rulings and instructions set forth in this Decision and Order
for Remand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Government Exhibit 1 was obtained under circumstances reflecting duress and
disregarding it as not a credible statement; (2) whether the Administrative Judge's favorable credibility determination of Applicant is sustainable; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusions
are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 7, 1997.  The SOR was based on Criterion D (Sexual Behavior), Criterion E (Personal
Conduct), and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  The SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in criminal sexual conduct in March 1986 and January 1996, and falsely denied to government investigators in
November 1987 and December 1996 that he had engaged in such criminal sexual conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on August 26, 1997.  The Administrative Judge later issued a written decision in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from that favorable decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Government Exhibit 1 was obtained under circumstances reflecting duress and disregarding it as not a credible statement</U>.  At the hearing,
Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibit 1, a written statement signed by Applicant in December 1996, which was admitted into evidence.  A Special Agent of the Defense Investigative
Service<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> and Applicant testified about the December 1996 interview which led to the creation and execution of Government Exhibit 1.  The Administrative Judge found Government Exhibit 1 was not a
credible statement.  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred because there is no legal or factual support for the Judge's finding about Government Exhibit 1.  Department Counsel's contention is
well-founded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because DOHA proceedings are civil, not criminal in nature, the procedural protections available to defendants in criminal proceedings are not applicable.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0127 (July 29,
1997) at p. 2; ISCR Case No. 95-0818 (January 31, 1997) at p. 6.  In addition, the exclusionary rule is not applicable in DOHA proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0792 (June 27, 1996); DISCR
Case No. 90-2069 (March 25, 1992) at p. 5.  Accordingly, even in the face of a claim that an applicant's statement was the product of coercion or duress, an Administrative Judge should not exclude the
statement from the record evidence.  However, if the Judge finds that an applicant's statement was the product of coercion or duress, such a finding clearly would go to the weight to which that statement
is entitled.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at p.  3; DISCR Case No. 92-0896 (December 30, 1993) at p. 4 n.1.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In reviewing the Administrative Judge's findings about Government Exhibit 1, the Board will consider federal decisions addressing the issue of whether confessions made by criminal defendants were
the product of coercion or duress.  Because DOHA proceedings are civil in nature, the federal decisions in criminal law cases will be considered as persuasive authority only.  For the reasons that follow,
the Board concludes that under applicable legal principles, the record evidence does not support a finding that Applicant's written statement was the product of coercion or duress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In considering whether a confession was voluntary, it is necessary to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding that confession.  Matters pertinent to such an evaluation include: the
circumstances surrounding the interrogation (including its length and continuity); the person's maturity; the person's education; the person's physical condition; and the person's mental health or
condition.  <EM>Withrow v. Williams</EM>, 507 U.S. 680, 693 (1993).<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Essential to any finding that a confession was not voluntary is evidence that the confession was obtained because the actions of the
interrogator(s) were coercive, oppressive, or reasonably calculated to overbear the will of the person making the confession.  <EM>Colorado v. Connelly</EM>, 479 U.S. 157, 163-64 (1986); <EM>Miller v. Fenton</EM>, 474
U.S. 104, 109-110 (1985); <EM>Lucero v. Kerby</EM>, 133 F.3d 1299, 1310-11 (10th Cir. 1998);<EM> United States v. Braxton</EM>, 112 F.3d 777, 780-81 (4th Cir. 1997)(en banc), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 118 S.Ct. 192 (1997).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this case, the Administrative Judge specifically noted that there was no evidence that the Special Agent tried to intimidate Applicant, but found that "under the particular circumstances of this case, the
Applicant could reasonably perceive himself to be under duress."  There is no record evidence showing that the actions of the Special Agent were coercive, oppressive of reasonably calculated to
overbear Applicant's will.  Indeed, the Judge's finding of duress is contradicted by the Judge's recognition that there is no record evidence that the Special Agent tried to intimidate Applicant.  The
Judge's finding of duress is not based on applicable legal principles nor supported by the record evidence, and therefore, it cannot be sustained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge's finding of duress was pivotal and essential to his finding that Government Exhibit 1 is not a credible statement.  Since the Judge's finding of duress is legally and factually
flawed, his finding that Government Exhibit 1 is not a credible statement cannot be sustained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable credibility determination of Applicant is sustainable</U>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant was a credible witness.  In support of this finding,
the Judge indicated Applicant was "a very credible witness" who gave testimony that "is consistent with his prior statements," and concluded Applicant's "credibility was not shaken by vigorous cross-examination by the Department Counsel."  Elsewhere in the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant's wife and best friend "confirmed circumstantial parts of the Applicant's testimony concerning his
ability to repair cars and that he only has one kidney."  Department Counsel contends the Judge's favorable credibility determination should not be sustained because it is not supported by the record
evidence as a whole and the Judge failed to consider Applicant's testimony in light of record evidence that was contrary to his testimony.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds Department
Counsel's contention to be persuasive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge's credibility determinations must be given deference on appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a.  However, the deference owed to a Judge's credibility
determinations does not immunize them from review, nor does it preclude the Board from concluding that a challenged credibility determination cannot be sustained.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0356
(April 21, 1998) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 96-0360 (September 25, 1997) at p. 3.  <EM>See also Paredes-Urrestarazu v. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service</EM>, 36 F.3d 801, 818 (9th Cir. 1994)(factual
finding is not rendered unassailable merely because trier of fact indicates the finding is based on demeanor of witness).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge's credibility determinations are entitled to deference because the Judge has the opportunity to personally observe and assess the demeanor of an applicant while the applicant is
testifying at the hearing.  However, a Judge cannot rely solely on his or her assessment of an applicant's hearing testimony when making a credibility determination about the applicant.   As the Supreme
Court has noted:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">"[T]he trial judge may [not] insulate his findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations, for factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to
believe a witness.  Documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness' story; or the story may be so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable fact-finder would not
credit it.  Where such factors are present, the court of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding purportedly based on a credibility determination."  <EM>Anderson v. City of Bessemer</EM>, 470 U.S. 564,
575 (1985).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this case, the Judge's favorable assessment of Applicant's credibility is flawed because it erroneously limits itself to considering Applicant's hearing testimony and ignores record evidence that clearly
detracts from that testimony.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a. ("The Appeal Board shall . . . determine whether or not: The Administrative Judge's findings of fact are
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record. . . .").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As discussed earlier, the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant's written statement (Government Exhibit 1) was given under duress is legally and factually flawed.  On its face, that written
statement seriously detracts from a finding that Applicant's testimony was credible or consistent with his prior statements.  Moreover,  the Judge's favorable credibility determination is not saved by his
conclusions that Applicant successfully withstood cross-examination or that his wife and best friend "confirmed circumstantial parts of the Applicant's testimony."  The portions of their testimony cited
by the Judge were trivial, tangential to the issues of the case, and essentially unsupportive of the important aspects of Applicant's testimony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge's favorable assessment of Applicant's credibility is not sustainable on the record evidence as a whole, or for the reasons given in the Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>.  Department Counsel contends that the Administrative Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.  In support of that contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Department Counsel had presented a <EM>prima facie</EM> case against Applicant,
but then concluding that Applicant did not engage in the conduct alleged in the SOR; (b) the Judge erred by suggesting the investigation of Applicant and the issuance of the SOR were improperly
motivated; and (c) the Judge's favorable conclusions under Criteria E, D, and J are not supported by the record evidence.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes some of Department Counsel's
arguments have merit.<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The reasoning of Department Counsel's first argument is legally flawed because the logical structure of the Administrative Judge's analysis is legally sound.  Department Counsel has the obligation to
present evidence to support contested SOR allegations.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 14.  Once Department Counsel has presented evidence to support contested SOR allegations,<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>
the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence that either: (a) rebuts the evidence against him, or (b) extenuates or mitigates proven conduct.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15. 
If an applicant presents evidence that successfully rebuts or refutes the evidence presented against the applicant, then the Judge can find that the alleged conduct did not occur.  It is legally permissible
for a Judge to find that Department Counsel presented evidence that supports controverted SOR allegations, yet also find that the evidence presented by an applicant successfully explained, rebutted or
refuted the evidence presented against that applicant.<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  <EM>See Black's Law Dictionary</EM> (6th edition, West Publishing Co., 1990) at pp. 1189-1190 (definitions of "prima facie," "prima facie case," and
"prima facie evidence").  Accordingly, the Board rejects Department Counsel's argument that once the Judge found Department Counsel had presented evidence supporting the controverted SOR
allegation, the Judge was legally or logically precluded from finding that Applicant successfully rebutted or refuted the evidence against him.  However, because of the errors identified elsewhere in this
decision, the Board cannot sustain the Judge's finding that Applicant successfully rebutted or refuted the evidence against him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel's second argument has merit.  It was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to suggest (Decision at footnote 4) the decisions to investigate Applicant
and issue the SOR were improperly motivated by an impermissible animus against Applicant's sexual orientation.  First, Applicant did not raise the issue of impermissible animus in response to the
SOR or at the hearing.  Indeed, Applicant's defense to the SOR allegations was inconsistent with raising any such defense.  Second, the Judge's suggestion is based on mere conjecture, lacks any basis in
the record evidence,<A HREF="97-0184.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> and ignores the legal principle that there is a rebuttable presumption of good faith and regularity on the part of government officials.  Third, the Judge's supposition is untenable
because the security significance of allegations of falsification and criminal sexual misconduct do not, logically or legally, turn or depend on the sexual orientation of an applicant.  Regardless of an
applicant's sexual orientation, acts of falsification raise serious questions about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information and can warrant an adverse security clearance decision.  <EM>See,
</EM>e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0525 (June 17, 1997)(falsification concerning sexual abuse of granddaughter); DISCR Case No. 93-1314 (October 25, 1994)(falsification concerning criminal heterosexual
misconduct).  Regardless of an applicant's sexual orientation, acts of criminal sexual misconduct raise serious questions about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information and can
warrant an adverse security clearance decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0461 (December 31, 1997)(sexual misconduct with adult woman); ISCR Case No. 96-0587 (March 24, 1997)(sexual
misconduct with minor boy); ISCR Case No. 95-0912 (February 27, 1997)(sexual exhibitionism); ISCR Case No. 95-0817 (February 21, 1997)(sexual misconduct with minor stepdaughter).  The
Judge's imputation of bad faith on the part of the government lacks any basis in law or the record evidence.  To the extent the Judge's favorable decision is based on his unsustainable finding of bad
faith, it is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel's third argument also has merit.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge's finding of duress in connection with Government Exhibit 1 and his favorable
credibility determination are legally flawed and cannot be sustained.  Because the Judge's favorable findings and conclusions are based on his rejection of Government Exhibit 1 and his favorable
credibility determination, they cannot be sustained on appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating harmful error.  Pursuant to Item 33.b. of the Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge.  After
correction of the errors identified in this decision, the Judge must issue a new decision  consistent with the requirements of Items 35 and 25 of the Additional Procedural Guidance.</FONT></P>
