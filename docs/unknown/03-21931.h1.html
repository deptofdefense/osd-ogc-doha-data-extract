<P>Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1980 from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and has immediate family members who are  citizens/residents of the PRC 
and an extended family member who is a PRC citizen residing in the U.S.   He fails to mitigate security risks associated with foreign influence concerns over 
the status of his family members connected to a country without any history of respect for human rights and the rule of law, and which has a reputation for 
targeting the U.S. for information gathering and acquiring advanced technologies.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On February 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on February 27, 2004, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 6, 2004, and received it on April 9, 2004.  Applicant timely responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him.   
The case was assigned to me February 11, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have parents who are citizens and residents of the PRC who he visits, (b) a sister and brother who are citizens 
and residents of the PRC and (c) a father-in-law who is a citizen of the PRC currently residing in the United States.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted each of the allegations without explanation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old senior system engineer who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are 
incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1980 in search of a better life and married his current spouse in 1984.  Both he and his wife became naturalized U.S. 
citizens in 1994. They have two children who are U.S. citizens by birth.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and siblings (sister and brother) remain citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant maintains regular contact with them and visits them 
annually in the company of his spouse.  Between 1994 and 2002, he traveled to the PRC on nine separate occasions to visit his family.  His father-in-law 
currently resides in the US and has applied for US citizenship.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, the PRC maintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC 
is known to use its intelligence services to gather information about the U.S. and to obtain advanced technologies.  The PRC actively monitors international 
communications satellites from maintained intercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on U.S. military operations and exercises.  Examples of 
PRC economic espionage are cited in an Annual Report to Congress in 2000 (official notice taken).  Most of the examples of illegally exported technology to 
the PRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in missile and aircraft guidance systems, highly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras and missile 
microchips. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Established in 1949, the PRC with over 1.3 billion people is the world's most populous country.  Today it continues to undergo rapid economic and social 
change.  Political power, however,  remains centralized in the Chinese Communist Party with little indication of any change in the foreseeable future.  As a 
corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a positive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights 
groups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC's lack of any cognizable tradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Examples of human rights abuses are many in the Consular Information Sheet produced by the U.S. State Department (official notice taken).  PRC security 
personnel, for example, are known to place foreign government officials, journalists, and business people with access to advance proprietary technology under 
surveillance.  Hotel rooms and personal computing devices for these categories are sometimes searched. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides its poor human rights record, the PRC is reputed to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sanction forced child labor, coercive abortions and sterilizations in the country's family planning 
programs.  Labor unrest has sparked in the country as a result of the government's economic reforms and increased emphasis on productivity improvement in 
its state-owned enterprises.  Continuing US-PRC disputes over Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet undermine improvements in US-China military relations. And 
PRC sponsored espionage aimed at U.S. military and economic interests increase the need for heavy security monitoring over sensitive U.S. industries. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>See

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members, co-habitant or associate  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an emigre from the PRC who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994.  His wife, who also immigrated  from the PRC, became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen, resides with him and their two children in the U.S.  While his father-in-law currently resides in the U.S., he has applied for U.S. citizenship (still 
pending).  By contrast, Applicant's parents and siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC,  a country known to engage in economic data collection in the 
U.S., and are in regular contact with Applicant and his spouse.  Altogether, Applicant has visited his immediate family members in the PRC  annually since 
1994 and maintains regular contact with them.  Security issues of concern to the Government center on (1) Applicant's status as a prior PRC citizen and 
resident, and (2) the current status of Applicant's parents and siblings as citizens and residents of the PRC, with whom he maintains regular contact, and (3) the 
status of Applicants' father-in-law, a citizen of the PRC and resident of the U.S..</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant's father-in-law (still a PRC citizen who resides in the U.S. and has applied for U.S. citizenship) 
and parents and siblings who are PRC citizens and residents might be subject to undue foreign influence by PRC authorities to access classified information in 
Applicant's possession or control.  Because Applicant's immediate family members reside in the PRC, they present potential security risks covered by 
Disqualifying Condition  (DC) 1 (immediate family members in a foreign country) of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The 
citizenship/residence status of these relatives in the PRC pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could 
compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control.   The Government's concerns have merit.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From what is known from the accounts of Applicant, neither his father-in-law who resides in the U.S. nor his parents and siblings who reside in the PRC have 
any financial or political affiliations with the PRC's government.  Too little is known about Applicant's U.S. residing father-in-law or immediate family 
members residing in the PRC, however, to fully discern what foreign pressures or influence they might be vulnerable to at this time.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What is known about the PRC is that it is a country that historically has targeted the U.S. for economic and proprietary data collection, and one that lacks any 
demonstrated positive history of human rights and respect for the rule of law.  While the PRC has shown interest in bilateral cooperative efforts with the U.S. in 
efforts to combat terrorism and aid in the suppression of nuclear arms threats in the region, it remains a country in considerable flux amidst widespread 
controversies over forced child labor, family planning, labor unrest, sovereignty issues over Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet and PRC sponsored espionage aimed 
at U.S. military and economic interests.  Human rights abuses and intensified campaigns against religious beliefs by PRC officials remain contentious issues 
between the U.S. and the PRC as well.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of the citizen/residence status of Applicant's immediate family members in the PRC and the U.S., respestively, and the lack of any documented 
information about their PRC government connections (if any) and situations, the potential for vulnerability of these family members remains a risk.  The risk of 
a hostage situation is not an acceptable one in this case, and Applicant may not take advantage of any of the mitigation benefits available MC 1 (presence of 
immediate family in host country poses no unacceptable security risk) of the Guidelines.  Overall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's 
having family members who are citizens/residents and/or citizen of the PRC are insufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's 
ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his immediate familial relationships in the PRC and the U.S.  Unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS  and CONDITIONS listed above, this 
Administrative Judge makes the following separate FORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Appellant's eligibility for a security clearance:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">CRITERION B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
