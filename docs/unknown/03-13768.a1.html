  Application of the Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Even if Applicant's financial difficulties arose due to circumstances outside of his control, the Administrative Judge could consider  whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties.  Given the record evidence, it was not arbitrary or capricious for  the Judge to conclude Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties.  Security clearance decisions are not  limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct at the workplace.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 2, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guidelines F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated January 25, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issue: whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's 
indebtedness had been fully mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's indebtedness had been fully mitigated</SPAN>.  On appeal, 
Applicant contends the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by his significant state and federal tax indebtedness were 
fully mitigated by application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 2,<A HREF="03-13768.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  3<A HREF="03-13768.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and 6<A HREF="03-13768.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and the "whole person" concept.  In support of that contention 
Applicant argues that: (a) the indebtedness resulted from conditions beyond his control--his wife's loss of her job and his subsequent separation and divorce, 
(b) his debts were discharged in bankruptcy two months prior to the hearing, (c) the Judge should have treated his first bankruptcy, which had occurred more 
than ten years prior to his second bankruptcy, as an isolated incident, and (d) he has held a security clearance for 31 years and has favorable character references 
from his employer.   For the reasons set forth below, the Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.</P> 
<P>The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) at p. 7.  Accordingly, the Administrative Judge's finding that many of the 
Applicant's original financial problems could be traced in part to conditions that were largely beyond his control did not compel the Judge to make a favorable 
security clearance decision.  Even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances outside his control, the Judge reasonably could 
consider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0462 (May 25, 2000) at p. 4; 
ISCR Case No. 99-0012 (December 1, 1999) at p. 4.  In this case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to it consider such factors as: (a) the length of 
Applicant's history of financial difficulties, (b) the extent and nature of his indebtedness, (c) his uneven and/or unsuccessful efforts at paying off or 
compromising his indebtedness, and (d) the presence of multiple discharges in bankruptcy, in reaching his adverse security clearance decision. Given the record 
evidence, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant's recent resolution of the significant tax indebtedness was a not a substitute for a timely, 
responsible approach to resolving his financial difficulties.  Therefore, the Judge was not required to conclude, as a matter of law, Applicant's history of 
financial difficulties was fully mitigated under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 3.  Given Applicant's repeated involvement with bankruptcy 
there is no basis for concluding the Judge erred in deciding not to apply Mitigating Condition 2.</P> 
<P>Likewise, the Board has previously discussed what constitutes a "good-faith" effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:</P> 
<P>"In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.' However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation.'  ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (October 12, 1999) at p. 4 (discussing concept of good-faith in connection with another provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines).  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) 
in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. [Footnote 12]" ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6.</P> 
<P>Again, given Applicant's history of financial problems, his repeated involvement with the bankruptcy process, the sizable nature of the tax indebtedness, and 
the fact that the debts at issue had been incurred years earlier, but had been resolved only after the invocation of the security clearance process, it was reasonable 
for the Administrative Judge to decide that the evidence was insufficient for him to conclude that Applicant's efforts to otherwise resolve his debts had been 
made in "good-faith."  Therefore, although the Judge gave Applicant some credit under Mitigating Condition 6, the Judge was not required, as a matter of law, 
to conclude Applicant's history of financial difficulties was fully mitigated under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.</P> 
<P>With regard to Applicant's final argument, the Board notes that the federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons 
granted access to classified information.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but 
rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See Department of the 
Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security 
implications<EM>.  See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0123 (January 11, 2000) at p. 3.  The Guidelines set forth in the Directive address a variety of examples of off-duty 
conduct and circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine an applicant's security 
eligibility.  A whole person analysis, by its very language, is not confined to the workplace.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-11231 (June 4, 2004) at p.3.  The favorable 
evidence cited by Applicant did not compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security decision.  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a 
whole and consider whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0296 (April 18, 2000) at p. 
6.</P> 
<P>Considering Applicant's burden of persuasion and the record as a whole, the Board finds that the Judge's adverse security clearance decision is sustainable.</P>
