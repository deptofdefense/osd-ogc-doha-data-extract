<P>Applicant has an extended history of engaging in deviant sexual conduct with himself, a boyhood friend, a transvestite, a homosexual stranger, his child, his
stepchild, other children, his sister, and his family pet. In 1998, he was convicted of Sexual Battery-Solicitation and placed on five years probation after his 17-year-old stepdaughter reported multiple acts of sexual abuse committed upon her by Applicant between May 1997 and May 1998.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On November 13, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-22088.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR, dated December 19, 2003, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing. In his response to
the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a. and 3.a., but admitted all other SOR allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 24, 2004, that was mailed to Applicant February 25, 2004. Applicant did not
object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for consideration within the 30-day time period provided to him. The case was
assigned to me May 10, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to some of the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 54 years old, has been employed by a defense contractor since October 1987, and is presently working as a shipping supervisor. He quit high
school during the 10</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> grade, subsequently obtained a general educational development diploma, and thereafter obtained an associate's degree. Applicant served
in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from December 1967 to December 1973, attaining the rank of Staff Sergeant (E-6). He has been married five times
to three different women. He married his present wife in March 1996. He has a daughter who is 22 years old. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on May 23, 1998, and charged with sexually abusing his then 17-year-old stepdaughter. The specific allegations were: in May 1997, he
rubbed her buttocks over her nightgown; in August 1997, he fondled her breasts, digitally penetrated her vagina, and forced her to masturbate him; and in May
1998, he rubbed her body simulating sexual intercourse. Applicant pleaded guilty to Sexual Battery - Solicitation on October 1, 1998, and was sentenced to five
years probation and ordered to complete psychosexual counseling.   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">During counseling, the full extent of Applicant's basically lifelong sexual deviance was revealed. His first sexual experience occurred at the age of 15 when he
was masturbated by a male friend.<A HREF="02-22088.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He had another homosexual encounter at a relatively young age while running away from home, and engaged in anal
intercourse with a female impersonator when he was 22 years old. His conduct progressed to numerous incidents of inappropriate sexually-oriented touching of
minor children who were as young as six years of age, both when he was a juvenile and as an adult, and peeping into the windows of juveniles, which began
when he was in late 30s. He had sexual intercourse with his 27-year-old sister when he was approximately 40 years old. Also while he was in his 40s Applicant
masturbated a dog, allowed the dog to lick his penis on 3-4 occasions, and, on occasion, would masturbate while driving to work and in the lavatory while at
work. Applicant also admitted to inappropriately sexually touching his 14-year-old daughter, and regularly sexually fantasizing about minor-aged children,
including a second stepdaughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant completed all requirements for graduation from the court-mandated sexual offenders' treatment program on August 27, 2001, and was officially
graduated as of that date. As a graduate of the program he is entitled to free follow up care as long as he desires. There is no indication in the FORM whether he
has pursued follow up care, and there is no prognosis about the likelihood of continued deviant conduct.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant completed a Personnel Security Questionnaire ( DD 48) on October 7, 1987, and checked "No" in response to question 15: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Have you ever used any
narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) or Cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish) except as prescribed by a licensed
physician? </EM>When he was interviewed during the course of sexual offender treatment on January 31, 2000, he disclosed he had used marijuana and speed, the
last use occurring 15 years prior.    </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1
through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline D,
pertaining to sexual behavior, Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their  respective DC and MC,
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sexual behavior</SPAN>. Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects
a lack of judgment or discretion. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a history of engaging in deviant sexual behavior that began circa 1965, when he was 15 years old, and continued until he was arrested in 1998,
when he was 49 years old. His conduct ranges from the sexual abuse of children to bestiality and incest. He was convicted of a sexual offense and ordered to
serve a sentence of probation that was scheduled to terminate in October 2003. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether
or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>; DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a pattern of self-destructive or
high-risk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder</EM>; DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,
exploitation, or duress</EM>; a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">nd DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which  reflects lack of discretion or judgment </EM>all apply in this case. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior occurred during or prior to adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM> clearly
does not apply. Considering the nature and extent of Appellant's conduct, I conclude that MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of
subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM>; MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM>; and MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The
behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress </EM>also do not apply. Guideline D is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal conduct under Guideline J is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets.  A history of illegal behavior
indicates an individual may be inclined to break rules.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Sexual Battery - Solicitation in October 1998 and placed on five years probation for multiple acts of sexual abuse committed
against his stepdaughter between May 1997 and May 1998. DC1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally
charged</EM> and DC2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply in this case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>.  </EM></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no indication Applicant has committed any criminal conduct since 1998. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was recent</EM>
applies. I have fully considered the remaining mitigating conditions and do not find that any apply. While Applicant was only convicted on one occasion for
sexually abusing a minor child, the statements he provided during sexual offender treatment clearly disclose this was not an isolated incident as he had sexually
abused numerous other children over a span of many years. There is no indication he was pressured or coerced into committing any of the acts, or any credible
evidence they were not done voluntarily.<A HREF="02-22088.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Lastly, although Applicant graduated from the sexual offender program there is no evidence to support a finding that
he has been rehabilitated or that his conduct in unlikely to recur. Considering all of the evidence, including the whole person factors, I find the sole mitigating
condition is substantially outweighed by the disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a personnel security questionnaire in 1987 in which he indicated he had not abused controlled substances. In January 2000 he indicated he
stopped using marijuana and speed 15 years earlier, which would seem to indicate he had used those controlled substances as far back as 1985. Applicant
emphatically denies he had any intent to intentionally falsify the questionnaire in question. Considering his candor in admitting the numerous sexual allegations
contained in the SOR, the circumstances under which he disclosed his prior drug use, and the period of time that had elapsed between when he submitted the
questionnaire and provided an estimate on when he last used controlled substances, I find he did not intentionally falsify the questionnaire. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, Applicant's significant history of engaging in deviant sexual conduct with his daughter, stepdaughter, sister, other children, family pet, and others
seriously calls into question his judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and willingness and/or ability to comply with rules and regulations. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable,
unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of
information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the
person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">apply. No mitigating condition applies to this conduct.
Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.      </SPAN></P>
