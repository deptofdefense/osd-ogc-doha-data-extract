<P>Applicant's foreign family ties have been mitigated and do not raise a security concern.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 12, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on November 29, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 22, 2004, scheduling the hearing for January 27, 2005.  At the hearing 
the Government presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
February 10, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 32 years of age.  He holds a 
asters Degree in Business Administration and a Masters Degree in Systems Engineering.  He is employed as a Systems Engineer for a defense contractor.  He 
seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in South Korea.  His family moved to the United States in 1991 at the young age of eighteen.  He obtained his college and advanced 
degrees in the United States.  He married a woman from South Korea in 2000.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit A, page 1).  The Applicant sponsored his wife and she 
is currently in the final process of getting her United States citizenship.  They have a young child who was born in the United States.  The Applicant became a 
naturalized citizen of the United States in February 2000.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother and brother are also naturalized United States citizens who reside in the United States.  The Applicant's grandmother is a citizen of 
South Korea but lives in the United States.  She entered the United States on a tourist visa and overstayed her visa.  She is currently living with the Applicant's 
mother in the United States.  She came to the United States to take care of her daughter, the Applicant's mother, who has brain cancer.  She is in the process of 
becoming a legal permanent resident of the United States.  All of the Applicant's immediate family members live in the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a mother-in-law and three sister-in-laws who are citizens of South Korea, and reside in South Korea.  The Applicant's talks to them about 
once a month by telephone to see how they are doing.  None of the Applicant's family in Korea or in the United States have ever been associated with, 
employed for, or agents of, the Korean government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has traveled to Korea on at least eleven different occasions from January 1998 to October 2001.  During this time, he worked in a technical 
leadership position that involved international business.  On each occasion, the travel was required by his United States employer.  None of the travel was for 
personal reasons.  The Applicant was not involved in any defense related work or classified work during this period.  (Tr. p. 27).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has purchased a home in the United States worth approximately half a million dollars.  (Tr. p. 51).  He has no assets of any kind in Korea.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A letter of recommendation dated October 8, 2004, from the Director of Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft, indicates that the Applicant is extremely dedicated 
and diligent toward his work assignments.  He is also considered to be very honest and a person of high integrity.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A letter of recommendation from the Applicant's Manager indicates that the Applicant is the hardest working individual on his team.  He works long hours and 
inspires his teammates to do the same to achieve schedule commitments.  He is very well respected among his colleagues.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that immediate family member(s), spouse, father, mother, sons daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates(s) in questions are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) 
and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules 
and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign influence has a direct 
and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 32 year old Applicant came to the United States when he was eighteen years old.  He became a United States citizen.  He obtained his advanced education, 
established his family, and made the United States his home.  He has a young child who was born in the United States.  His mother, brother and grandmother 
also reside in the United States.  The Applicant is married to a Korean citizen who is in the final process of receiving her United States citizenship.  None of the 
Applicant's family members in Korea or in the United States have ever been affiliated with, employed for, or agents of, the Korean Government.  Therefore, 
mitigating condition <EM>(1) a determination that the immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question would not constitute an unacceptable 
security risk </EM>applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although his mother-in-law and three sister-in-laws still reside in Korea, he has only casual and infrequent contact with them.  Mitigating condition<EM> (3) contact 
and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent </EM>also applies.  The Applicant has significant assets in the United States and none in Korea.  
Except for his mother-in-law and three sisters-in-law in Korea the Applicant has, for the most part, cut all of his ties with Korea.  The Applicant credibly 
testified that there is no situation that could ever occur that would force him to reveal classified information to any unauthorized individual no matter what their 
relationship to the Applicant.  He has no foreign ties or contacts that could potentially influence him.  Therefore, I find that there is no situation that could create 
the potential for foreign influence that could result in his compromise of classified information.  Accordingly, the Applicant's request for a security clearance 
must be granted under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline  B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P>
