<P>The Applicant has surrendered her Taiwanese passport and renounced her Taiwanese citizenship.  However,  her close and continuing relationship with a foreign financial interest, namely her 
parents, poses a security risk.  Clearance is denied.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should 
be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 18, 2005, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on November 25, 
2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 7, 2006, scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2006.  At the hearing the Government presented eleven exhibits.  The Applicant presented seven 
exhibits and she testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open until March 10, 2006, to allow the Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted one 
Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of six pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 7, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 24 years of age and holds a Bachelors Degree in Electrical 
Engineering.  She is employed as a Multi-Discipline Engineer II for a defense contractor.  She seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Taiwan.  She moved to the United States in 1997 at the age of sixteen and was sponsored by her uncle and cousins who had moved here earlier.  She attended high school 
and then went on to college, where she obtained her Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering.  She became a United States citizen in June 2002, and was issued a United States passport in July 
2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's father and mother are citizens and reside in Taiwan.  Her father is a physician.  Her mother is a housewife.  They own a home in Taiwan worth approximately $600,000.00 in United 
States dollars.  (Tr. p. 42).  They also have a checking account in Taiwan with about $500,000.00 in it.  (Tr. p. 42).  The Applicant's father and mother travel back and forth between the United 
States and Taiwan about three or four times a year.  The Applicant contacts them by telephone about once a week and by e-mail about once a week.  Her father and mother plan to move to the 
United States when they retire.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant lives with her two brothers and sister in a home that was purchased and is owned by her father and mother.  Her parents pay for all of her living expenses and other miscellaneous 
bills so that she is able to save her earnings and invest them.  She has $50,000.00 in her savings account, $50,000.00 in stocks, and $30,000.00 in her 401K in the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's maternal and paternal grandmothers are citizens of and reside in Taiwan.  She contacts them only during her visits to Taiwan.  The Applicant also has a friend in Taiwan who 
recently quit her job to go back to school to get her MBA.   She contacts her by e-mail about once a week.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has traveled to Taiwan on seven separate occasions in 1998, 2000, 2001 (twice), 2002 and 2003.  She tries to visit Taiwan about once a year to see her family there and stays about 
three weeks on each given visit.  She usually travels with her brothers and sister and stays at her parents home in Taiwan.  She also visits her grandmothers during this vacation.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has acted in such a way as to show a preference 
for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant renewed her Taiwanese passport on December 27, 2000, that was not to expire until December 27, 2010.  Since becoming a United States citizen she has used her Taiwanese passport 
on only one occasion when traveling to Taiwan in 2002 because she was uncertain which passport to use.  She now uses only her United States passport to travel abroad.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a letter dated October 7, 2005, to the Taipei Economic And Cultural Office, the Applicant indicated that she surrendered her Taiwanese passport.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibit 7).  She testified that 
she is also willing to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship and requested that the record remain open for additional documentation to support this effort.       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A letter dated March 8, 2006, stated that the Applicant mailed her letter requesting to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship to the Taipei Economic And Cultural Office on March 1, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Post-Hearing Exhibit).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Performance and Development Summary for 2005, indicates that she is an effective team member with excellent technical skills.  She is a quick learner, great team player and  needs 
minimal supervision.  She was submitted for a team achievement award based upon her outstanding performance.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibit A). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or 
mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent 
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  
Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful 
to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens 
of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Sharing living quarters with a person or person, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number 
of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   
The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a 
rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely to be 
repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The 
mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes that 
the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct and negative impact on her suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was a dual citizen of the Taiwan and the United States who possessed a Taiwanese passport.  Disqualifying Conditions, <EM>(1) The exercise of dual citizenship </EM>and<EM> (2) Possession and/or 
use of a foreign passport</EM> apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions  <EM>(1) Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country </EM>and <EM>(4)  Individual has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship </EM>are applicable<EM>.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since learning that possession of a foreign passport is not permitted when holding a security clearance, in compliance with the provisions of the Money Memorandum, she surrendered her foreign 
passport to the Taiwan Economic And Cultural Office.  She has also renounced her Taiwanese citizenship.  Under the circumstances, the Applicant has done everything possible to be in compliance 
with the requirements of the directive and the Money Memorandum.  Accordingly, she has clearly demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this 
case, I find for the Applicant under Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that she is vulnerable to foreign influence.  The Applicant's father, mother, grandmothers on both sides, and a friend are all citizens and 
residents of Taiwan.  The Applicant has close, regular, frequent and continuing contact with her parents.  The Applicant resides in a home owned by her parents in the United States and is 
completely dependent on them for her financial support.  In fact, her parents in Taiwan, pay all of her bills and living expenses in the United States.  Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) an immediate 
family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country,</EM> (2) <EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or 
person, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists </EM>and (8)<EM> A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign owned or operated 
business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.  </EM>The Applicant retains close ties with Taiwan.  Based on the foregoing, under the current policy, the Applicant raises a 
security concern and Guideline B is found against the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not 
met his ultimate burden of persuasion under B.  Guideline C is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
