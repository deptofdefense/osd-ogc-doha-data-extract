<P>Applicant has a history of abusive drinking that is marked by both blackouts and a still recent aggravated DWI conviction.  In an ensuing aftercare program, the 
licensed alcohol drug abuse counselor who evaluated him characterized his condition as alcohol abuse on the Axis 1 scale.  Despite a favorable prognosis from 
his aftercare counselor and commitment to abstain, Applicant returned to drinking (sometimes to what could be characterized as abusive), which he continues to 
do.  Based on Applicant's drinking history and abstinence failures, it remains too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant can avoid risks of recurrent 
judgment lapses associated with his past alcohol abuse.  Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 21, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 25, 2003,and received it on October 20, 2003.  The exhibit file contains no documentation that he provided any 
timely response to the FORM within the time permitted .  The case was assigned to me December 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 28-year-old material handler for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol to excess from the time he was 21 to the present, (b) consumed 2 to 6 beers a night 
between 1996 and 1999, (c) blacked out 15 times after alcohol use from 1997 to 1998, (d) been arrested for aggravated DWI in August 1999, to which he pled 
no contest, was found guilty, fined $600.00, sentenced to 6 months in prison (suspended for 2 years) and had his driving privileges suspended for a year, (e) 
attended an alcohol aftercare program in July and August 2000, completing the program in September 2000, (f) attended an alcohol treatment program, 
completing this program in September 2000, and (g) continued to drink.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, including his 1999 aggravated DWI offense and disposition.  He denied drinking 
excessively every day and denied consuming alcohol past December 31, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant began drinking at the age of 19, mostly on the weekends at a friend's house.  For the ensuing 2 years, he consumed from 1 to 6 beers a sitting.  In 
some weeks he would not a drink at all; in other weeks he would engage in drinking in one to two sittings a week (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).  When Applicant turned 21, he 
increased his alcohol consumption to 4 to 5 nights a week.  During each sitting he estimates to have consumed 2 to 6 beers, depending on his mood.  His 
drinking at first relaxed him.  But as he increased his consumption, he blacked out on numerous occasions, about 15 times in 1997 and 1998, altogether (ex. 5).</P> 
 
<P>Preceding his 1999 aggravated DWI, Applicant consumed 10 beers, 2 shots of tequila and a tequila sunrise.  On the way home from a friend's house, he passed 
out behind the wheel and veered into a parked car.  He was taken to a hospital for testing and blood work.  Thereafter, he was arrested for aggravated DWI after 
he registered a blood alcohol level in excess of .16 per cent (<EM>see</EM> ex. 7).  As the result of his ensuing guilty conviction, he was sentenced to 6 months in jail 
(suspended for 2 years), fined $600.00, and had his driving privileges suspended for 2 years.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant attended both an alcohol aftercare program and an alcohol treatment program  following his 1999 aggravated DWI conviction.  From his counseling 
experiences, he gained good feedback about the dangers of drinking.  In his alcohol treatment program, he was diagnosed by a licensed alcohol and drug abuse 
counselor with alcohol abuse, based on his taken history of consumed alcohol of up to 7 beers a sitting and his 1999 aggravated DWI conviction.  Applicant 
attended all 6 sessions prescribed by his treatment counselors and is credited with gaining useful knowledge about the disease of alcoholism.  His treatment 
counselors assigned him a favorable prognosis, but recommended he continue his claimed abstinence (which he assured he had adhered to for the previous 3 
months).  </P> 
 
<P>After completing his contemporaneous aftercare and treatment programs and attending a few AA meetings, Applicant convinced himself he could control his 
drinking without the need of aftercare, treatment, or AA.  Despite claims in his answer he discontinued drinking altogether in December 2002, he stated 
otherwise in his signed, sworn to interrogatory responses (<EM>i.e., </EM>3 to 4 beers at a time on a weekly basis after March 2003).  With nothing more in the record to 
reconcile these competing stories, Applicant cannot avert inferences that he continued to consume alcohol after December 2002 at the consumption levels stated 
in his interrogatory responses (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6).  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list guidelines to be considered  by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
Judges must consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the 
"Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the 
judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the 
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are 
intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related 
to alcohol use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4  Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5  Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3  Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a material handler for a defense contractor with a considerable history of alcohol abuse.  His past record of excessive consumption and 
blackouts must be assessed as well when evaluating his diagnosis, counseling and drinking patterns following his 1999 aggravated DWI conviction. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his 1999 aggravated DWI conviction, Applicant elected to enroll in both an aftercare program and treatment program.  Each program was designed 
to (and appeared to) help him better understand the nature of alcoholism and abusive drinking.  Despite a favorable prognosis from his treatment counselors, 
which to some extent hinged on his continued abstinence which he underscored with his counselors, he returned to drinking, at times even to excess.  On the 
strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away from work), DC 4 (evaluation of alcohol abuse by a licensed social worker) and DC 5 (habitual or binge consumption).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance eligibility, major emphasis must be accorded his past recent drinking history, the aggravated nature of 
his 1999 DWI conviction, his ensuing counseling and abuse evaluation by a licensed social worker, and his continued drinking despite his commitments to 
abstain.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions to date, Applicant demonstrates some progress in learning about alcohol abuse. However, he did not stay long enough with his abstinence 
commitments to sustain the faith placed in him by his treatment counselors.  Not only are his assurances of discontinued drinking in December 2002 belied by 
his earlier admissions in his interrogatory responses, but his drinking level even arises to abusive levels on occasion for someone who presents with the serious 
abuse history that Applicant has (<EM>i.e., </EM>3 to 4 beers at a weekly sitting).  Without any sustained abstinence record, he is not in a position to take advantage of  the 
key mitigating condition for evaluated alcohol abuse, namely DC 4 (following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence the individual has successfully 
completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participates in meetings of AA or a similar organization, has abstained from 
alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a 
staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In fairness to Applicant he has been able to avoid any additional alcohol-related incidents away from work and seems to have reduced the amount of his 
drinking, both in terms of the number of sittings per week and the amounts consumed in each sitting.  His efforts do merit some use of MC 3 (positive changes 
in behavior supportive of sobriety).  But his efforts to date still lack the probative weight necessary for crediting him with sufficient indications of sustained 
mitigation of both his drinking problems and encounters with law enforcement authorities to overcome any residual security risks associated with his past 
alcohol-related judgment lapses.  Based on this written record, it is still too early to make safe predictions about Applicant's ability to avert recurrent judgment 
lapses associated with his drinking.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make the convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert 
any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with 
such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related allegations covered by Guideline G. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
