<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On March<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 10</SPAN>, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 24</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On May 31<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006</SPAN>, the case was 
assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice dated June 29, 2006, a hearing was held on July 19, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Government's Exhibits 1-3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit  (Applicant's Exhibit 
A) and offered his own testimony.  The record was left open, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> submitted additional documents which have been marked collectively as Exhibit B. All exhibits have been entered into 
evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN>July 27<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under 
Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. </SPAN>The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J</SPAN><STRONG>, </STRONG>and two allegations, 2.a. 
and 2.b., under Guideline G. Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.  The admitted allegations are incorporated as Findings of Fact.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 26 years old, and unmarried. He is employed as an Aerospace Engineer by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1  Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts that occurred in 2002 and 2004, and which have been included  in the SOR as 1.a. and  1.b.</SPAN>  
Both allegations will be discussed as they were alleged in the SOR: </P> 
 
<P>a.   Applicant was arrested on July 23, 1991, and charged with DUI and Negligent Driving. On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 22, 2003, a</SPAN> bench warrant was issued for his failure to appear. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> testified that during the 
court process, the case had been continued, but he had never received notice of the continued date. He never knowingly failed to attend any court scheduled appearance. When he learned of the 
bench warrant, he returned to the court and quashed the warrant and set the case for trial (Tr at 21-22). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was sentenced to 365 days in jail, of which 363 wee suspended, five years probation. He was ordered  to pay $1,560 in probation fees, a fine of  $880, and $125 in court fees. His license 
was suspended for 365 days. </P> 
 
<P>b.   Applicant was arrested on July 25, 2004, and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, and (2) Driving With Blood Alcohol Level of .08% or Higher.  Applicant was found 
guilty and was sentenced to serve 180 days in jail, which was suspended. He was fined $1,700, ordered to participate in a counseling program, to serve two days of public work service, and he was 
placed on five years of probation. Finally, his driver's license was restricted for 70 days.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> was required to attend 30 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)meetings as a result of his first arrest and three AA meetings because of his second arrest. He attended all the required meetings 
and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN> seven more (tr at 44-45).     </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2  Guideline E (Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>         a.   That  information  as  set  forth  in  subparagraphs  l.a. and l.b., above.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>b.   Applicant attended 40 hours at an alcohol education school in June through August, 2004, at the suggestion <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of an</SPAN> alcohol counselor, who reviewed his case as a result of his 2002 arrest.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">At the hearing </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> testified that he</SPAN> has consumed no alcohol since July 24, 2004, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and he intends to abstain from imbibing in the future.  Applicant</SPAN> also <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">testified that  he has changed his 
lifestyle by running and cycling and reading self-help books to improve himself (Tr at 27- 31). I find Applicant's testimony regarding his abstention and his desire never to consume alcohol again to 
be credible. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Four individuals submitted character letters on behalf of Applicant (Exhibit A). Two have known him primarily through work related interaction, one was a friend and former roommate, and the 
fourth is from <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> mother. All of them were extremely positive about Applicant's excellent character and honesty.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> mother and friend spoke about the profound change in 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> since he no longer consumes alcohol, and now lives a much healthier life. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN>   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the overall common sense determination 
required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish 
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of 
such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has 
a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government has established by substantial evidence that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's conduct, which occurred </SPAN>in 2002 and 2004<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and which is the basis for allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR,  </SPAN>is criminal.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(E2.A10.1.2.1.), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(E2.A10.1.2.2.)</SPAN>, a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">apply because Applicant's conduct did involve serious criminal offenses, the 2 DUIs. Regarding Mitigating  Conditions (MC), I 
find that there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, and MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(E2.A10.1.3.6.) applies,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was extremely convincing that he has not consumed any alcoholic beverage since 
July 2004, and he intends never to drink alcohol again. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's consumption of alcohol to excess has led to his two alcohol related incidents in 2002 and 2004.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, in this case driving under the influence, which is Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) (E2.A7.1.2.1.). </SPAN>It has also been established <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">that Applicant has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment which is which is DC 
</SPAN>(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </P> 
 
<P>MC (E2.A7.1.3.3.) applies, because <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as discussed above, Applicant has changed his behavior positively and significantly </SPAN>to support his sobriety.  Guideline G is concluded for Applicant.</P>
