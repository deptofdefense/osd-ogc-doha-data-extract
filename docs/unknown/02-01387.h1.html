<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant, a 41-year-old security guard for a defense contractor, had several extra-marital affairs and took leave from her place of duty without so annotating

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, applied for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), the federal agency 
tasked with determining an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information, declined to grant Applicant a clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-01387.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-01387.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 11 December 2002 detailing why a clearance was 
not granted and recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the 
SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant failed to meet the personal conduct (Guideline E), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and sexual behavior (Guideline D) personnel 
security guidelines. </P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 26 December 2002 and 27 January 2003.  The case was originally assigned to me on 19 February 2003.  On 13 
arch 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The 
Government's case consisted of two exhibits.  Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one witness to testify, and submitted 10 exhibits at the hearing.  A 
transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on 21 March 2003.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old security guard for a defense contractor.  Tr. 47.  Prior to accepting the security guard position, Applicant had worked as a 
maintenance employee for the same defense contractor.  She currently possesses a security clearance.  Tr. 20.  </P> 
<P>Applicant was married to her first husband from 1976-1982.  However, after about 1978, the couple had several periods of estrangement and separation.  Tr. 41.  
In 1979, Applicant had a sexual affair with a man to whom she was not married.  Answers.  After their divorce in 1982, Applicant and her ex-husband re-married in 1984.  Tr. 42.  In 1985, they divorced again.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>Applicant married a different man in 1988, separated from him in 1991, and filed for divorce.  Tr. 42-43.  Applicant's husband refused to sign the paperwork 
and the divorce was eventually dropped.  In 1998, Applicant's husband filed for divorce and alleged adultery as one of the grounds so that he would not have to 
distribute property equitably.  Tr. 26; 43.  Applicant's husband did not finalize the divorce, but she did in January 2003.  During her marriage to her second 
husband, Applicant had sexual affairs with three men.  All of these affairs occurred while Applicant was separated from her husband.</P> 
<P>In her statements to DSS agents, Applicant never denied having sexual relationships with men other than her husbands.  Exs. 1, 2.  She simply refused to accept 
the characterization of these affairs as extra-marital.  Although she was still married during these affairs, she was separated from her husbands and there was no 
chance of reconciliation.  She understood that she could live separate and apart from her husband.  Tr. 25; Ex. G at 1.  Although Applicant tried to keep the 
affairs quiet, some of her family, friends, and professional acquaintances were aware of them.  Ex. 2 at 2.</P> 
<P>While Applicant was working as a maintenance employee, she took an hour or two leave per month without annotating it on her time card and without getting 
the express permission of her supervisor.  Ex. 2 at 1.  In a 31 July 2001 statement given to a DSS agent, Applicant stated, "At no time have I ever left the job 
without being excused or without having taken appropriate leave."  Ex. 1 at 2.  Nevertheless, Applicant's supervisor gave her authority to take small periods of 
time off without annotating her time card as long as her work was done well and she did not make it a habit.  Tr.  52-53, 58.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.  Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 2.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. May 9, 
2001).  Once the Government has established a prima facie case by substantial evidence<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate the facts.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D-Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline D that Applicant had four extra-marital affairs and had sex with her supervisor in an automobile at the work site.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline D, sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the 
individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.  The following conditions are possibly 
applicable and could raise a security concern in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Directive &para; E2.A4.l.2.3. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following mitigating conditions may be applicable to Applicant's case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature.  Directive &para; E2.A4.l.3.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability.  Directive &para; E2.A4.l.3.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.3.4. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only evidence that Applicant had sex in public with her supervisor is a statement given by an unnamed individual to an agent investigating Applicant's 
security worthiness.  That statement is hearsay, and I have no basis upon which to judge its credibility.  Applicant and her former supervisor both denied having 
any sexual relationship or being in a car together.  After closely observing their demeanor and listening to their testimony, I am convinced of their credibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security 
suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2 1996).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, however, the Government failed to establish the existence of any of those 
criteria.  There is no evidence that these affairs indicated a lack of discretion or judgment or made her vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Although 
she did not want these affairs to become public knowledge, neither did she hide them from her family, friends, and some of her co-workers.  She was not 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if I had concluded that the Government had established a prima facie case, I would still rule for Applicant under this Guideline.  Applicant has mitigated 
any security concerns.  The affairs are not recent, were done while she was separated from her spouses, were not conducted at the same time, and she never 
denied them.  Under the circumstances, my finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that, while Applicant was married, she had several sexual affairs and then lied about the affairs to Defense 
Security Service (DSS) agents and in a signed, sworn written statement she provided them.  DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified her time card by failing to 
record absences from work of approximately one to two hours each month.</P> 
<P>Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  The following conditions could 
raise a security concern in this case and could be disqualifying:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.3..</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.  Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.2.5. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following applicable conditions could mitigate the security concerns in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.3.l.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.3.5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a prima facie case that Applicant deliberately provided false information to DSS agents investigating her security worthiness by 
asserting she did not have extra-marital affairs and by denying she absented herself from work without annotating her time card or getting permission from her 
supervisor.  However, Applicant mitigated the security concerns.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence Applicant ever denied her sexual affairs.  She simply refused to accept the characterization of those affairs as extra-marital.  While she was 
still married at the time of these affairs, she believed she was authorized to live separate and apart from her husband and that included the option of carrying on 
sexual affairs.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant now admits that she took off one to two hours a month from her job, but did not annotate it on her time card.  Yet, her supervisor at the time testified 
that he granted Applicant authority to take some time off as long as her duties were performed and she did not make it a habit.  The supervisor also testified that 
Applicant kept her part of the bargain by performing her duties well.  Under the circumstances, I cannot conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified the 
information she provided to secure a clearance.  The finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant's denial in her signed, sworn statement of having extra-marital affairs and leaving work without 
permission amounted to violations of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.  
The following applicable conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following conditions could apply to this case and mitigate the security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The crime was an isolated incident.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, it is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or to 
make or use any false writing "in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States."  The granting of security 
clearances is a function of the executive branch of Government.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  The term "false," as used in &sect; 1001, means "more than simply 
incorrect or untrue.  An intent to deceive or mislead is required under the act . . . ."  <EM>United States v. Lange</EM>, 528 F.2d 1280, 1286 n.10 (5<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1976).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As discussed above, Applicant never denied that she engaged in sexual affairs with four men while she was married.  She simply refused to accept the 
characterization of them as extra-marital, or as immoral.  Under these circumstances, it is doubtful that her quibbling over the term "extra-marital" is relevant or 
material to a determination of her security worthiness.  Regardless, I am convinced she did not intend to deceive or mislead the DSS agents about her sexual 
affairs during her marriages.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence on Applicant's failure to annotate her time card to show periods of time she was not at work is more problematic.  In her first statement, she did 
not offer the agents an explanation, she simply denied it outright.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted leaving the job without express permission, but 
maintained that her supervisor had authorized her to take brief periods off without annotating her time card.  The Government established a prima facie case 
against Applicant.  However, Applicant's defense that her supervisor knew what she was doing was supported by the weight of the evidence.  Thus, her 
absences were not unexcused.  I am convinced that Applicant never intended to mislead the investigator.  Furthermore, her misstatement was an isolated event 
and is not likely to recur.  Under the circumstances, the finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
