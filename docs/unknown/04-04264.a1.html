<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 5, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline K (security violations), pursuant to Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. 
Wesley granted Applicant's request for a security clearance. Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Administrative Judge's favorable security decision is arbitrary, capricious and contrary 
to law and record evidence.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant did not file a reply brief.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Factual Findings</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.. Facts</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found the following:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old senior software engineer for a defense contractor.  He had a Top Secret clearance for almost 20 years, and the incident at issue was 
his sole security violation.   The Judge found that Applicant is a senior software engineer who received annual training in the NISPOM.</P> 
 
<P>Late at night, Applicant attempted to log on to an administrator's classified computer, but was unable to do so because access was limited to those with an 
administrator's password.  Applicant then logged on to a colleague's classified computer, and used his personally owned flash memory card with USB adapter 
(similar to, and referred to hereinafter as, a thumb drive) to download unclassified files.  He left the office and went home, where he transferred the downloaded 
files from the thumb drive to his personal digital assistant (hereinafter PDA) to verify that the files were actually downloaded.  Applicant disregarded in-place 
security procedures without consulting security or system administrator personnel.  Applicant disregarded the NISPOM.  He neither availed himself of 
approved trusted downloading procedures, nor checked the PDA for classified information before bringing the device home.  He was not sure these 
downloading actions violated security policy.  Then he deleted the downloaded files from the thumb drive and the PDA.</P> 
 
<P> The next day, the administrator received a message on his computer about needing to reboot when he attempted to log on, disclosing Applicant's attempt to log 
on the previous evening.  As a result of the message on the administrator's computer, later that same day, Applicant was questioned and admitted his conduct as 
previously described.  Upon request, he provided his thumb drive, PDA, and home computer for forensic examination.  No classified files were detected.  Due 
to the circumstances of his deliberate security violation, Applicant was sanctioned by his manager.  At his hearing, Applicant said his purpose in downloading 
the files was "to see if the classified computers would recognize and allow access to the memory card device."  He had no intention of keeping the unclassified 
files, only to verify whether or not the procedure would work.  Applicant described his actions as an "experiment." He also said it was a "bad decision," and he 
stated that he should be held accountable for it.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that the security officer was unable to determine if the files were classified or not. He also found that the files Applicant 
created and downloaded were not classified.  The Judge wrote that "inferences warrant . . . that none of the data transferred to Applicant's memory card reader 
and PDA contained classified information."  The Judge also found that Applicant's introduction of the thumb drive and PDA into a DoD closed classified 
network system without consulting security or system administrator personnel violated paragraph 5-100 of DoD 5220.22-M.  Moreover, Applicant had 
previously received a security briefing where he was told about approved downloading procedures, and that personal computing devices were barred from his 
facility.  Prior to the security violation, Applicant had utilized the proper procedures for downloading unclassified information from a classified computer. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN>B. Discussion</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's findings of fact were not explicitly challenged on appeal.  However, certain ambiguities and discrepancies are pertinent to the 
appeal issues raised and are discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Whether the record supports Administrative Judge's ultimate conclusions </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge is required to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for" the decision, "including a 'rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice made.'"  <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</EM>, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) 
(quoting <EM>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</EM>, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant, 
deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is "arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law."  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this standard is narrow 
and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Judge. We may not set aside an Administrative Judge's decision "that is rational, based 
on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency . . ."  <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n</EM>, 463 U.S. at 42. We 
review matters of law <EM>de novo</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant's conduct was a deliberate security violation. <EM> See</EM> Directive &para; E2.A11.1.2.2.   The Judge concluded that two 
mitigating conditions were established: (1) the security violation involved a single incident, that is, it was "isolated or infrequent."  Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; E2.A11.1.3.2;</SPAN>.<A HREF="04-04264.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>   
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and, (2) Applicant "[demonstrated] a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities.  Directive &para;  E2.A11.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applying a whole person assessment, the Judge concluded:  (1) Applicant's explanation for the security violation was extenuating; (2) he provided full 
disclosure of his security violation; (3) he had an otherwise clean record of observing security procedures; (4) he made positive contributions to his employer's 
classified software program; and (5) he exhibited remorse, an attitude change,  and a renewed understanding about the importance of protecting classified 
information and abiding by security rules.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Security violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about 
an applicant's suitability for access to classified information.  ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998).  Once it is established that Applicant 
has committed a security violation, he has "a very heavy burden of demonstrating that [he] should be entrusted with classified information.  Because security 
violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny."  
ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2001).  In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an indicator of a risk that 
they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use).  Here the issue is not merely an indicator, rather the Judge found 
Applicant disregarded in-place security procedures in violation of the NISPOM.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel asserted that the Judge's determination that the security violation was isolated or infrequent (Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; E2.A11.1.3.2) and that Applicant 
demonstrated a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities (Directive &para;  E2.A11.1.3.4) were not supported by the record evidence. 
</SPAN>Department Counsel argues that the Judge's acceptance of Applicant's description of his conduct as an "experiment" and his finding of remorse despite 
Applicant's testimony that the rule prohibiting his conduct was a "grey area" were erroneous.  The Judge should have found that Applicant's comments were 
instead evidence that Applicant did not accept full responsibility for his conduct.<A HREF="04-04264.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Judge found that Applicant is a senior software engineer who received annual training in the NISPOM.  In short, the Judge's own findings undermine his 
finding that Applicant "wasn't sure" his downloading actions (from somebody-else's classified computer to his personally owned storage device while working 
late) violated security policy.  Later the Judge refers to the same incident as a deliberate security violation.  The Judge then leans back in the other direction 
when he writes "Applicant's explanations of mishandling his classified computer system, memory card reader and PDA in his possession and control are 
sufficient to mitigate and extenuate the security violations attributable to him."  The Directive instructs that our scope of review shall be to determine whether 
or not the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a 
conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Such is not the case here.  The Judge's decision leads the reader in two very different 
directions about the incident at the heart of the case: it was a deliberate security violation by a man who had to know better, and it was an experiment by a 
person who wasn't sure what he was doing.</P> 
 
<P>Also troubling is the Judge's statement on page 6 that careful consideration was given to " his absence of any acknowledged classified information in all but 
two of the incidents. . ."  This clause is unclear because it refers to <EM>multiple </EM>incidents and seems to say that<EM> two </EM>of them involved classified information.  
Previously, he described <EM>one </EM>incident with some ambiguity<A HREF="04-04264.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> as to whether there had been <EM>any</EM> classified information involved.</P> 
 
<P>The Judge cites two decisions as Appeal Board guidance.  Both decisions are Hearing Office decisions, not Appeal Board decisions, and furthermore are 
distinguishable from the facts in this case.</P> 
 
<P>Although a Judge has broad latitude and discretion in deciding how to write a decision, the Judge must issue a decision that makes findings and reaches 
conclusions that the parties and the Board can understand.  This is a threshold issue that precedes any analysis of the questions asked by Department Counsel in 
its brief.  Previously, in such cases we have remanded the case <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-13568 (App. Bd. Feb 13, 2004) and ISCR Case No. 01-21030 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 13, 2004).  The Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge with instructions to prepare a new decision which is unambiguous, supported by 
substantial record evidence, and reasonable in light of all the contrary record evidence on the questions of: how many incidents there were, Applicant's level of 
knowledge of the impropriety of his conduct at the time it occurred, and Applicant's willingness to accept responsibility for his conduct.</P>
