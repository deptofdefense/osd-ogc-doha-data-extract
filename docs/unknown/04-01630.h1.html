<P>Applicant, a United States citizen, has spent all but the first two years of his life in the United States. He has immediate family members who are citizens and  residents of Israel. None of them has ever 
been employed by the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> of Israel or is in a position to be exploited by Israel in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the 
United States. Applicant's extremely strong attachment to the United States and his minimal ties to Israel makes it highly unlikely that he would respond favorably to any efforts to act against United 
States' interests.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a Security Clearance Application (SCA) supplied to the Government</SPAN> in March 2003, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied that he had ever had a clearance or access authorization denied or revoked, 
which was correct at the time that he completed the SCA. </SPAN>Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), dated January 26, 2005, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>February 16, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant submitted a signed and sworn response to the SOR, and he requested  a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 16, 2005, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 22, 2005, and the 
hearing was held on September 13, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 6), and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through counsel, offered nine documentary exhibits, (Exhibits A 
through I) and offered his own testimony and that of four other witnesses. The transcript (Tr) was received on September 26, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B and Guideline E of the Directive .</SPAN>The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., under Guideline 
B (Foreign Influence) and one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations under Guideline B and denies the one allegation 
under Guideline E.. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make 
the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 43 year old.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He received a Master of Science 
degree in electrical engineering from a United States university in 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Israel. In 1964, </SPAN>at the age of 2, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Applicant and his family <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">left Israel and came to the United States. </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has lived in this country permanently since that time, and he became a 
naturalized United States citizen in 1977, the same time that his parents became </SPAN>United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 36)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant previously had an Israeli passport, but he has returned it to the Israeli </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He has been making a good-faith attempting for three years to renounce his Israeli citizenship, but because 
of apparent bureaucratic problems, he has not yet been successful. He is still pursuing this attempt, and based on correspondence from the Israeli </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, he hopes to be successful in the near future

<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has traveled to Israel in 1979, 1986, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2005. They were all casual trips, generally to see his family.  In one case he went to Israel for his mother's funeral, and the most 
recent time it was to celebrate the Bar Mitzvah of his two sons (Tr at 37-38).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a potential financial interest in a property in Israel, owned by his father and estimated to be worth $100,000. This is divided between him and his three siblings and 12 grandchildren. He 
his net worth in the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is worth far more including his home that he estimates to be worth $850,000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> expressed strong feelings for his preference for the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> over Israel, based on several factors including the fact that he has lived here for all but the first two years of his life, and his 
wife and four children are </SPAN>United States born citizens.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He also testified that he has voted in </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> elections but never in Israeli elections, and he has no contact with anyone in Israel except his 
immediate family(Tr at 98-99).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness  to comply with 
rules and regulations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SCA</SPAN> on March 4, 2003.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Question #32 asks,  "To your knowledge have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended or revoked, or have you ever been 
debarred from </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> employment?" Applicant answered "No" to this question. The evidence shows that Applicant was ultimately denied access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), 
but it was not until June 2003, which was three months after he completed the SCA. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">letter dated March 7, 2003, from the agency making the decision about his access, indicated the decision was still under formal review (Exhibit A). On March 13, 2003, Applicant submitted a letter to 
the agency, which had requested additional information. Since he was still submitting information after he completed the SCA, he did not believe that a final decision had been made and therefore, he 
believed he correctly asserted in his SCA that he had not had a clearance denied or access authorization denied, suspended or revoked  </SPAN>(Tr at 62-66)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigation</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Two witnesses, who have known </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> in an employment status, testified at the hearing on behalf of </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. They described him in the most positive terms and neither one had any reservations 
about recommending him for a position of trust. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Another witness, who has known </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> as a friend and religious study partner, testified as to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> honesty, integrity, and generosity. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">'s wife testified as to her husband's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant submitted a letter of reference on his behalf, from his former supervisor, in which he stated Applicant always performed his job efficiently and honestly (Exhibit G).</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the overall common sense determination 
required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence 
or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as 
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a 
person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish his 
security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such 
factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a 
heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the 
clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN>Guideline B (Foreign Influence) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Applicant's father, sister and 
brother are citizens and  residents of Israel. The Israel citizenship and residency of  members of Applicant's immediate family creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such a tie raises a security concern sufficient to require 
Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security 
clearance for him. This </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of these family members, who are citizens and residents of Israel, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.   Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of 
the evidence, including: the lack of government involvement of Applicant's family in Israel, Applicant's long history since coming to the United States, where he has lived all but the first two years of 
his life, his ties to all of his family members, especially his wife and four children who are United States citizens and residents, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and  his testimony about his feelings concerning the United States</SPAN>, I have 
determined that his father, sister, and brother in Israel do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. applies. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant does have a potential financial interest in his father's condominium, which comes under DC E2.A2.1.2.8., but the amount is small. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that MC E2.A2.1.3.5. applies because t</SPAN>he 
financial interests are not <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests of the United States. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR, and even in the unlikely event 
pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the incident to the proper authorities.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence is clear that at the time Applicant completed the SCA, he had not formally and finally had a clearance denied or access authorization denied, suspended or revoked.  Therefore, he was 
correct at the time that he completed the SCA, and he had no intention to furnish false information to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the Adjudicative Guidelines for Personal Conduct, I conclude that no DC  applies as the Appellant did not  provided false and misleading information of relevant and material facts in the  SCA.</SPAN></P>
