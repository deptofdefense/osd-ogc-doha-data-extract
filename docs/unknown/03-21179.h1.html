<P>The Applicant's drug use and falsification of a Government questionnaire has not been mitigated by a sufficient showing of reform and rehabilitation.  Adverse 
inference is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 22, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 19, 2004, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The Department Counsel 
submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on March 3, 2005.  The Applicant was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any 
additional information to the Administrative Judge.  The Applicant acknowledged receipt the FORM on March 4, 2005, and elected not to submit any 
additional information.  The case was received by the undersigned for Decision on May 18, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 29 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Information Engineer, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted in his Answer that he used marijuana at least five times between 1995 and 2001.  This was during his service in the United States Navy 
from 1996 until 2001.  At that time the Applicant had an SCI clearance in connection with his service.  (Item 4 at Question 11, and Item 7.)  The Applicant also 
admitted in his Answer using Ecstacy one time and contributing to its purchase in November 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer, the Applicant denied contributing to the purchase of marijuana.  However, in an interview in July 2001, the Applicant admitted that, "HE 
contributed a few dollars towards the purchase of Marijuana and reported this as HIS only involvement with Marijuana."  (Item 7.) (Emphasis in original.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant answered a set of Interrogatories concerning his drug usage in January 2004.  In answer to question 1, concerning his drug use, he stated, 
"Around May 2000 I experimented once with marijuana and once with ecstasy."  (Item 5 at 5.)  He further stated in question 2 that he only "experimented" with 
the drugs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.  He is also ineligible for clearance because he engaged in actions 
which involve questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted downloading software to his home computer that he did not pay for.  In addition, the Applicant also admitted that he took home 
software programs from his employer and put them on his home computer without permission.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 2001, the National Security Agency (NSA) denied the Applicant access to Sensitive Compartmented Information due to his use of illegal drugs 
and possession of illegal software, as set forth above.  (Items 8 and 9.)  The Applicant states in his Answer that he never received notice of this event.  
However, Item 8 indicates that the NSA did advise him of the decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 3, 2002, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had used marijuana or any other illegal drug within the 
preceding seven years.  (Item 4, Question 27.)  This statement was a false answer to a material question pertaining to the Applicant's former involvement with 
illegal substances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 28 of Item 4 asks whether the Applicant had EVER used illegal substances while possessing a security clearance.  The Applicant answered this 
question, "No."  This was also a false answer to a material question concerning the Applicant's conduct while holding a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated in his Answer that his falsifications were not intentional.  The Applicant's statement is not credible, given his different statements.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be 
discussed under CONCLUSIONS, below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of drug abuse, dishonest conduct and falsification of Government questionnaires that demonstrates poor judgement, 
untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Guideline H); and that he 
intentionally made false material statements to DoD (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to the Applicant, his marijuana use ended three years before the record closed.  However, as set forth above, he has a history of lying concerning the 
true extent of his drug use.  Accordingly, one cannot be sure when, or even whether, the Applicant stopped.  The burden is his to show that he has stopped using 
drugs, and he has not met it.  Disqualifying Conditions E2.A8.1.2.1. <EM>Any drug abuse</EM> and E2.A8.1.2.2.<EM> Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution</EM> apply.  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply to this case.  Accordingly, Guideline H is found against 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  In addition, the Applicant admitted dishonest 
conduct regarding the improper use of software shows poor judgment on his part.  Disqualifying Conditions E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>The deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities </EM>and E2.A5.1.2.5. <EM>a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including the violation of any written or recorded agreement made 
between the individual and the agency </EM>apply.  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply to this case.  Guideline E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons. </SPAN></P>
