<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the Laos. Her three brothers and one sister are citizens and residents of Laos. Her mother 
and two brothers are citizens of the United States, but remain residents of Laos. The extremely limited evidence offered into the record could not demonstrate 
</SPAN>that  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>'s family is not in a position to be exploited, and could not  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mitigate the foreign influence security concerns of the United States Government. 
Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On April 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. She requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing. On July 27, 2004, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided 
to Applicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant filed a response to the 
FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on September 13, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered 5 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-5), and Applicant offered one documentary evidence (Exhibit A), all of which have been 
admitted without objection into the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family 
members are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress. The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through 1.c., under Guideline B. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In her response to 
the SOR, Applicant admits all three allegations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Unfortunately, in this case the evidence offered into the record regarding Applicant's background and the allegations alleged in the SOR is extremely limited.  
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence that has been entered in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the admitted 
documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional Findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 43 years old. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">She is employed as a Financial Analyst, by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her 
employment in the defense sector. Applicant  received a General Office diploma in 1986, and she is married.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was born in the Laos in 1961, apparently to United States citizens.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">She indicated on her Security Clearance application that she became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 1986, although if her parents were United States citizens that would not have been required.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Her husband </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">became a naturalized United 
States citizen in 1983 (Exhibit 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's mother and two brothers are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Laos and reside in the United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> (Exhibit 2). The frequency of her contact with them, their employment 
positions in the United States, and their contact with employees or representatives of the Laotian Government is all unknown. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant maintains contact with three brothers and one sister who are citizens and residents of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Laos </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 2). The frequency of her contact with them, their 
employment positions in Laos, and their contact with employees or representatives of the Laotian Government is all unknown. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant traveled to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the Laos</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> on three occasions, in the years 1991, 1996, and 1999 (Exhibits 2 and 3).The reason for her trips, and whether she visited Laos 
any additional time(s) after 1999 is unknown. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is also not known if Applicant has any financial interest in Laos or whether she keeps in contact with other individuals in the country. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Finally, she never 
offered evidence as to what she would do if the Laotian Government threatened her family if she did not cooperate with the Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">           </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth 
policy factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case 
according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned 
decision. Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of 
human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot 
draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive 
Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's 
immediate family members, including her three brothers and one sister, are citizens and residents of Laos. Her mother and two brothers are also Laotian 
citizens. The Laotian citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises 
a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for her. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This 
Applicant has not done. </SPAN></P>
