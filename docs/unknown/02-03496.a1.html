  Under the pertinent Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986, and the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver be  considered.  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the waiver recommendation made by the Judge  below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a  waiver should be considered.  Adverse decision affirmed.  The Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986.</P>

<P>Applicant has appealed the May 16, 2003 decision of Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales, in which the Judge concluded it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Board should recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 22, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).  The Administrative Judge issued an adverse security clearance decision dated May 16, 2003.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's 
appeal from that adverse decision. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact about his 1975 conviction for sale of cocaine.  Nor does Applicant 
challenge the Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to this case.<A HREF="02-03496.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant: (a) asserts that he believes he would have received a favorable 
security clearance decision but for the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986; (b) refers to the Judge's recommendation that his case be considered further for a waiver 
under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986; and (c) asks that his case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize an exception to the statutory 
prohibition against granting or renewing a security clearance for cases covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) or 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(4).</P> 
 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, 
DOHA is the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>Since the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is not at issue on appeal, all that remains for the Board to do is consider Applicant's request that it recommend further 
consideration of his case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's 
recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an 
explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board 
recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 
10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge 
below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a 
waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded him from making a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case is not at 
issue on appeal.  Application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precludes a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in Applicant's request that the Board recommend his case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Department of Defense may not grant or renew a security clearance for a defense contractor official or employee that falls under 
any of four statutory categories [10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) through (c)(4)].  10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) states: "The person has been convicted in any court of the United 
States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."
