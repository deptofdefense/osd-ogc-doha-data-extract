<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 10, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 6, 2000, and Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in 
lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 21, 2000.  
Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the 
FORM.  Applicant received his copy on an unspecified date, and Applicant's reply was received on July 5, 2000.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on July 17, 2000, and an unfavorable Decision was issued on July 21, 2000.  The 
Applicant appealed this adverse Decision, alleging "a failure of the Administrative Judge to consider or understand the statements 
made by his former spouse about the matters covered by SOR 1.a." (Appeal Board Decision and Remand Order (ABD&amp;RO) at 
page 2).  In fact, the undersigned did not consider any "statements made by his former spouse," as no such statements were offered 
into evidence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 7, 2000, the Appeal Board issued a Decision and Remand Order with specific guidance :</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . to reopen the record to receive from both parties information to determine the following: (1) whether Applicant's former 
spouse gave written statements to DSS [Defense Security Service]; (2) if Applicant's former spouse gave written statements to 
DSS, were copies of them provided to DOHA; (3) if copies of such written statements were provided to DOHA by DSS, did DSS 
or Department Counsel provide Applicant with copies of them; (4) did Applicant have copies of such written statements because 
his former spouse gave him such copies; (5) if Applicant had copies of such written statements by his former spouse, did he have 
them when he answered the SOR or responded to the FORM; (6) whether, given all the circumstances, Applicant has a right to 
offer such written statements as evidence on his behalf; and (7) if so, whether Applicant wishes to exercise that right on remand 
(ABD&amp;RO at page 4). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 13, 2000, Department Counsel forwarded to the undersigned "a complete copy of the Applicant's investigative file 
as provided to DOHA by DSS."  Department Counsel also responded to questions (2) and (3) posited above by averring, "Our 
review of this case file discloses no references in the Report of Investigation to DSS interviews of the Applicant's wife, nor are 
copies of any written statements made by Applicant's wife to DSS included as attachments."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 16, 2000, the undersigned issued an Order Based Upon Remand Order, ordering Department Counsel to further 
answer question (1), and for the Applicant to answer questions (4) and (5).  On November 20, 2000, Department Counsel 
responded to question (1), averring, in sum, that Applicant's former spouse gave no written statements to DSS.  On November 22, 
2000, the Applicant responded to my Order Based Upon Remand Order, asking that I consider six attachments.  As </SPAN>Attachments 4 
and 5 are already in evidence as Item 1 and as page 4 to Item 3 of the Government's File of Relevant Material, I will not admit 
them into evidence a second time.  Attachment 6 is a September 1, 2000, letter from his former spouse.  This letter post dates my 
original Decision, was also submitted to the Appeal Board, and, as the Appeal Board notes in its <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ABD&amp;RO</SPAN>, "is new evidence, 
which . . . cannot [be] considered" (<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ABD&amp;RO</SPAN> at page 2).</P> 
 
<P>Attachments 1~3 are from the files of the National Security Agency (NSA), and are dated December 13, 1999; April 1, 1999; and 
April 6, 1999; respectively.  As they predate the issuance of the SOR, are relevant and material, and Department Counsel has no 
objection to their admission into evidence, Attachments 1~3 are admitted into evidence as Applicant's Exhibits (AppXs) A~C.  
The case is now ready for a Decision based upon the Remand Order. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's criminal conduct and related personal conduct militate against the granting of a 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material, Applicant's Response, 
and AppXs A~C.  The Applicant is 39 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on 
behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct &amp; Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a., 1.b. and 2.a.  The Applicant was arrested in January of 1997, and subsequently pled guilty to Assault - Second Degree (Item 5 
at pages 2~3, and Item 7).  The incident involved domestic violence with his spouse, who required medical attention for fractured 
ribs and a punctured lung (Item 5 at pages 2~3).  As part of his sentence, he was required to complete an Anger Management 
Counseling Program (Item 5 at pages 2~3, and Item 7).  In her statement to the police, his now former spouse averred the 
following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . that there has been <STRONG>a history of abuse</STRONG> but this was the first time that she was hospitalized. . . . [She] advised that she is usually 
struck or thrown down on the ground or bed <STRONG>about once every 2 to 3 months</STRONG> and that she normally receives bruises on her legs 
(Item 6 at page 2, emphasis supplied).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an April 6, 1999, sworn statement to the NSA, she averred, in part, the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>In late 1995</STRONG>, after learning of a likely miscarriage, we were arguing in the kitchen.  I do not know the sequence of events, but 
recall being <STRONG>pushed</STRONG> and sliding 3-4 feet on the floor and hoping that I had already had the miscarriage so that this <STRONG>fall</STRONG> would not 
cause any defects.  I do not in any way believe this incident caused the miscarriage (AppX C at pages 3~4, emphasis supplied).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She also swore to the following incident:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I do not know when, but I remember sitting with . . . [the Applicant] in a chair.  At some point <STRONG>he pushed me out of the chair by 
pushing me by the jaw</STRONG>.   He was very concerned and apologetic for the pain I was in.  At the time, I was thinking there was a 
fracture in my jaw.  As the pain lessened over the next hour or so, I was relieved it was not broken (AppX C at page 4, emphasis 
supplied).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his March 6, 2000 answer to the SOR, the Applicant admits only to the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . that on the <STRONG>three</STRONG> occasions of alleged abuse my wife would become angry with me and would slap me.  I would push her 
away.  The last time it happened she caught her foot and fell over a chair.  This does not take away my part of the blame (Item 3 at 
page 1, emphasis supplied).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed sworn statement, executed by the Applicant on August 25, 1998, the Applicant swore "that other than the Dec 96 
incident, I have never physical(<EM>sic</EM>) abused my spouse.  I feel that this was an isolated incident, and out of character for me.  I am 
not a violent person, and I regret my actions" (Item 5 at page 3).  This sworn statement is contrary to his wife's statement to the 
police,  her statement to NSA, and his own admission as to three occasions of domestic violence.  I find that he knowingly and 
wilfully falsified his August 25, 1998 sworn statement, and thus violated 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Considering all of the evidence, and in light of the fact that the Applicant was less than candid with the Government, the Applicant 
bears a heavy burden of persuasion in demonstrating his suitability for security clearance access.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a 
security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should 
be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of 
the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each 
security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the 
realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P> 
 
<P>2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>3.  Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . in 
connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P>As set forth in the Directive,"[e]ach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, 
including as appropriate:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>   c. Age of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequence involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the 
evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in 
nature.</P> 
 
<P>The Government must make out a case under Guideline E (personal conduct), and J (criminal conduct); which establishes doubt 
about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an 
applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a 
rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P> 
 
<P>Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which 
demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security 
clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations; and criminal conduct also creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and 
regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the 
possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was less than candid with the Government as to his past physical abuse of his ex-spouse in his August 1998 sworn 
statement.  This wilful falsification is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  The spousal abuse and the falsification demonstrate a 
fairly recent pattern of criminal conduct on Appellant's part.  In 1996 he battered his wife and was convicted for this transgression, 
and in 1998 he was less than candid with the Government about his past abuse of his former spouse, thereby violating a federal 
statute.  Both guidelines are therefore found against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his personal and criminal conduct.  
The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and J, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, 
he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and J.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>a.   Against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>b. Against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>a. Against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
