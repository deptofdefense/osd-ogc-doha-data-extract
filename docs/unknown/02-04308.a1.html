  Once a case has been appealed, the Board has jurisdiction over the case and the Hearing Office Administrative Judge has no jurisdiction or authority to take any action concerning that case.  Judge's Amended Decision was issued when Board had jurisdiction over the case and, therefore, the Amended  Decision was a legal nullity.  Board cannot review the decision below de novo.  Absent a showing of factual or legal error below, the Board does not have a  legitimate basis for reversing the Judge's decision.  Board does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 21, 2003 which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  
Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated October 14, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Board should review Applicant's case <EM>de novo</EM> and reverse the Administrative Judge's 
decision; and (2) whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d). For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural Ruling</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision dated October 14, 2003.  On October 29, 2003, Applicant filed a timely notice of appeal.  For reasons not 
apparent from the case file, the Judge issued an Amended Decision on October 29, 2003.  Because the Board had jurisdiction over Applicant's appeal, the Judge 
had no jurisdiction or authority to take any action concerning Applicant's case on October 29, 2003.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No.98-0004 (June 19, 1998) at p. 2.  
Accordingly, the Administrative Judge's Amended Decision is a legal nullity, and the Board will adjudicate Applicant's appeal based on the Judge's October 
14, 2003 decision.<A HREF="02-04308.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Board notes that nothing in the Administrative Judge's Amended Decision adds to Applicant's rights in these proceedings, and therefore, the outcome of 
this appeal would be the same even if the Amended Decision were not a legal nullity.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should review Applicant's case <EM>de novo</EM> and reverse the Administrative Judge's decision</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the 
Administrative Judge's findings or conclusions, or the Judge's legal rulings.  Indeed, Applicant expressly notes that she is not raising any specific claim of 
factual or legal error by the Judge, but rather asks the Board to review her case "with a fresh mind" and reverse the Judge's unfavorable security clearance 
decision.</P> 
 
<P>There is no presumption of error below.  Furthermore, the Board does not review security clearance cases <EM>de novo</EM>.  Absent a showing of factual or legal error 
below, the Board does not have a legitimate basis for reversing an Administrative Judge's decision.  Unless an appealing party demonstrates error below, the 
Board will let a Judge's decision stand.  Applicant asks the Board for a form of appellate review and relief that is not available under the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d)</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge 
concluded Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, and that application of that statute precludes a favorable security clearance decision in her case.  
However, the Judge recommended that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  On appeal, Applicant specifically cites the 
reasoning and conclusions of the Administrative Judge in support of her request that she be granted a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, 
DOHA is the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>Because there is no issue on appeal about the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, all that remains for the Board to do is consider Applicant's request that it 
recommend further consideration of her case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend 
that a waiver be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 
986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a 
recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole 
in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded him from making a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case is not at 
issue on appeal.  Based on that conclusion, the Judge properly made an unfavorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because Applicant's appeal does not raise any claim of factual or legal error by the Administrative Judge, the Judge's decision stands.</P> 
 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in Applicant's request that the Board recommend her case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  The Board reaches this conclusion for the following reasons: (1) the Board does not have the authority to 
review the Administrative Judge's recommendation that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d); and (2) the Board is precluded 
from giving an explanation for its own recommendation concerning waiver.</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
