<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On October 15, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 24, 1996,  and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative
Judge on January 15, 1997, and on February 24, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it was clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny,
or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of five exhibits and
no witnesses; Applicant relied on his own testimony and two exhibits.  A transcript of the
proceedings was received on March 6, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR, except for the
factual allegation set forth under subparagraph 1.d., which he has denied.  I have accepted
Applicant's admissions and incorporate them as part of my findings of fact.  After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is 27 years old and has been employed by his current employer since March
1995.  In this first attempt to obtain a security clearance, he is applying for a clearance at the
secret level.  A preliminary determination could not be made because of financial considerations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant began to fall behind in his financial obligations in 1989 while he was still in
college. When he graduated from college in May 1991, he was married, had two children, and
owed more than $27,000.00 in education loans. At that time Applicant had also become indebted
to Creditor A for $923.00, to Creditor B for $1879.00, and Creditor C for $195.00.  In the time
since graduating from college, Applicant's indebtedness has increased even more.  He now owes
Creditor D more than $4268.00 for rent on an apartment which he and his ex-wife occupied prior
to their separation in March 1992.  He owes Creditor E $300.00 on a judgment entered against
him for unpaid rent on an apartment (this judgment was originally $878.50) which he occupied
during 1994.  He owes Creditor E an additional $3193.50 for another judgment entered against
him after he vacated the same apartment before the lease had expired. Applicant owes Creditor F
$143.00 for an indebtedness incurred prior to June 1994.  He owes Creditor G $126.14 for an
indebtedness referred for collection by the telephone company.  And Applicant owes Creditor H
$115.00 for an indebtedness referred for collection by the cable company.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Some of his financial difficulty, Applicant attributes to two periods of unemployment. 
He was unemployed from October to December 1991 (Gov. Exh. 1), and from October to
November 1994 (Tr. 42).  He disputes his obligations to Creditor's D and E.  The obligation to
Creditor D was for an apartment in which he and his ex-wife were living prior to their separation. 
He asserts that she assumed and then reneged on her obligation to pay the rent (Gov. Ex. 2, Tr.
51,82, Ans. to SOR); however, he does not proffer any evidence of such an agreement, nor does
he offer evidence of a subsequent settlement with Creditor D under which he would be relieved
of one-half of the obligation (Tr. 52).  Applicant claims that his indebtedness to Creditor E was
incurred through his rent of an apartment that was not fit for occupancy.  Because of the
apartment's condition, Applicant moved out before the lease had expired.  He testified that he
has no recollection of receiving "notice" before </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">these judgments were entered against him (Tr. 69-70).  Consequently, he did not present
evidence of the apartment's condition before the court entered its judgment against him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Recently, Applicant has sought the services of Consumer Credit Counseling and arranged
to have payments totaling $154.00 monthly (Tr. 31) made through them to Creditor's A (with an
outstanding balance [OB] of $923.00 ), C (OB of $195.00), E (OB of $879.50), F (OB of
$143.00), and G (OB of $80.33), (see App. Exh. B).  He has been trying to make monthly
payments of $50.00 on his education loans (OB of $27,000.00<A HREF="96-0750.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>), but because of other pressing
financial obligations, he has made only eight payments since April 1995.  Applicant is not
currently making payments to Creditor's B (OB of $4268.99) and D (OB of 1879.50).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant provides financial support for four biological children and one stepchild.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion F)</CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>(1)       A history of not meeting financial obligations;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	None</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria F.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each
of the factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion F.  The evidence establishes
that Applicant has had serious financial problems for at least seven years and will continue to have
them for the foreseeable future.  He is currently delinquent on obligations totaling more than
$38,000.00. Even assuming that he continues to be gainfully employed and continues to receive
regular salary increases, his current financial obligations, together with those obligations on which
he has become delinquent, ensure that he will remain behind in his financial obligations into the
foreseeable future and beyond.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	There is evidence that certain of the mitigating conditions under Criterion F are present in
some measure. Applicant was unemployed on two occasions, he has received counseling for his
financial problems, and he has initiated a good faith effort to repay some of his overdue creditors. 
On closer examination, there is insufficient evidence of any of the conditions to allay the concerns
raised by Applicant's chronic financial problems.  While Applicant's unemployment on two different
occasions certainly prevented him from repaying his debts in a timely manner, unemployment did
not cause his problem.  Applicant was experiencing financial problems before the periods of
unemployment and he has continued to fall in arrears on financial obligations incurred at times when
he has been gainfully employed.  Applicant recently received counseling for his financial problems.
However, because the debt payment program arranged by the counseling service does not cover all
of his obligations, there is no evidence upon which to conclude that his problem "is being resolved
or is under control."  Finally Applicant has initiated a repayment program through the debt
counseling service.  While I do not question his sincerity and his desire to pay down his obligations,
his past performance does not inspire confidence that he will follow through and systematically
reduce his indebtedness.  Previously, he had undertaken to pay down his educational loans at the rate
of $50.00 per month.  In the past 22 months while regularly employed, he has been able to make that
minimum payment less than one-half of the time.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Confidence that Applicant will be able to meaningfully address his substantial delinquent
financial obligations is diminished further by evidence that he did not or could not pay his monthly
telephone bill.  If he was unable to remain current on an obligation that is payable monthly--usually
in relatively small amounts--for a service he was then receiving, it is unlikely that he will summon
the discipline and resources to make payments on obligations incurred 5-10 years ago--for products
and services that do not impact on his current well being.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Finally, Applicant has demonstrated an ineptitude or disinterest in dealing with financial
matters that has doubtless contributed to his current predicament and will probably continue to
exacerbate his problems in the future.  He claims that his ex-wife assumed the responsibility of
paying the rent on the apartment after he moved out in March 1992 (Tr. 82), but he  has been unable
to proffer any evidence of that agreement, or of a subsequent offer by the creditor to hold him
accountable for only one-half of the outstanding obligation.  As a consequence, the entire
indebtedness of more than $4,000.00 remains his obligation.  If he has had a legitimate reason for
not paying on this obligation, he has had sufficient time to produce evidence which supports his
inaction.  On the basis of the evidence, I am not prepared to conclude that Applicant is lying about
who is responsible for this obligation.  Rather I am prepared to conclude that Applicant is inattentive
to his finances and indifferent to the DoD's concerns about them.  Further evidence of this character
trait is present in Applicant's actions after he moved into an apartment which was not properly
maintained.  I do not expect Applicant to pay rent for living quarters which were not suitable for
occupancy, but I do expect him to present evidence of the apartment's condition in his own defense
when the landlord seeks a judgment for back rent.  Because he did not, Applicant was obligated for
paying the rent on an apartment which he could not and did not occupy, and he became obligated
for paying rent on the housing he occupied after vacating the derelict premises. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has not heretofore demonstrated the financial discipline necessary to meaningfully
address his substantial indebtedness.  Until he does, his financial problems will not be satisfactorily
resolved by making small monthly payments to a handful of delinquent creditors through Consumer
Credit Counseling.  Criterion F. is concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
