<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On July 27, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis for 
that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a 
hearing. On May 19, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Joan Caton Anthony </SPAN>denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant states in his appeal submission that none of his family members are associated with the governments of either Korea and that his wife has applied for U.S. citizenship and that  Applicant 
and his wife have renounced their son's South Korean citizenship.  He further states that his in-laws plan to seek U.S. citizenship and that his loss of a security clearance has caused financial 
hardship  and embarrassment. </P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the administrative judge committed harmful error. Applicant has not made an allegation of 
harmful error. Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED </P>
