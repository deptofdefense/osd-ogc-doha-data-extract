<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On November 16, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 22, 2005, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Charles D. 
Ablard denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guidelines J is sustainable.<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision is not sustainable and should be remanded because the Judge indicated in the 
synopsis and conclusions section of his decision that Applicant had pled guilty to a 2001 misdemeanor charge of Soliciting Prostitution, in Texas, when in fact 
Applicant had pled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolo contendere </EM>to the charge.  The Board does not find Applicant's argument persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Board does not review a Judge's decision against a standard of perfection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0319 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 1996).  It reviews a 
decision as a whole, rather than focusing on isolated sentences or passages in it, to discern what the Judge meant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-29608 at 3-4 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his answer and his signed, sworn statement to the government's investigator, Applicant stated he had pled guilty to the 2001 charge, and gave an explanation 
about the incident.<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  At the hearing, Applicant introduced a copy of the Judgement of Reduction for the charge, which showed the entry of a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle contendere</EM> 
plea, and that the Texas Judge had heard the evidence relating to the charge, if any, and adjudged Applicant guilty of the offense.<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In the findings of fact 
section of his decision, the Administrative Judge found Applicant had entered a plea of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolo contendere</EM> to the charge, and in the conclusions section noted that, 
since the charge was a misdemeanor, Applicant was not bound by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Under Texas law, the legal effect of a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolo contendere 
</EM>plea is the same as a plea of guilty, except that it may not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act 
upon which the prosecution was based.<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  That is, a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolo contendere</EM> plea constitutes an admission to every element of the offense.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, given the record in this case, there was sufficient evidence<A HREF="03-17708.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> to support an adverse finding as to the matter of security concern--that Applicant had 
committed the 2001 offense at issue.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   The Applicant was responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts that the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant 
admitted, and the Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision. Directive &para; E3.1.15.  The 
Administrative Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate the facts and circumstances of Applicant's past 
conduct and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met his burden of persuasion under 
Directive &para; Item E3.1.15.  In deciding whether Applicant met this burden of persuasion, the Judge reasonably could consider whether Applicant presented 
evidence that was indicative of extenuation, mitigation, changed circumstances, or reform and rehabilitation.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-05110 at 6 (App. Bd. 
ar. 22, 2004); and Directive &para; E2.2.1.6.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all of the evidence presented.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).  In his decision, the Judge made findings which reflected consideration of the nature of Applicant's plea, 
the circumstances of Applicant's conduct, and Applicant's explanations and the other mitigating evidence that was offered at the hearing.  The fact that 
Applicant's explanations and his mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the ultimate decision desired by Applicant is of no moment.  Considering the 
record as a whole, there is sufficient evidence to support the Judge's overall adverse clearance determination, given a legal standard that requires the Judge to 
err on the side of national security.  </SPAN></P>

access to classified information, are not really analogous to collateral civil court lawsuits for monetary damages or injunctive relief growing out of criminal incidents.  Moreover, the Board has 
previously noted that compliance with state law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>U.S.

accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive &para; E3.1.32.1. "This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of 
drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Consolo v. Federal Maritime

Judge's credibility determinations. Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</SPAN></P>
