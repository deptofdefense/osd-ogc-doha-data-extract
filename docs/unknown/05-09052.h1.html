<P>This 31-year-old engineer was arrested and convicted of misdemeanor theft in 1973 and was cited for possession of a glass bottle on a beach in 2003. The SOR incorrectly alleged the 1973 incident 
to be a felony and the 2003 incident to involve alcohol, neither of which is shown by the record.  Likewise, the allegations about falsifications on his security clearance application are unsupported 
since the underlying allegations have not been shown to be correct.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On January 15, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On February 8, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was assigned to 
me on April 10, 2006.  A  Notice of Hearing was issued on May 2, 2006, and the hearing was conducted on June 1, 2006. At the hearing, Department Counsel introduced two (2) exhibits 
(Government's Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2).  Applicant testified, called three other witnesses, and introduced  twelve (12) exhibits (Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A - L). The hearing transcript was received 
at DOHA on June 8, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old engineer.  The SOR contains three (3) allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and  three allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant admits 
allegation 1.b.  He denies allegations 1.a., 1.c., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c.  All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  </P> 
 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to` the status of each SOR allegation.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)  </EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>1.a  The SOR alleges that in about March 2003, Applicant was cited for possessing  an Open Container of Alcohol in State A.  At the hearing, based on the testimony of the OPM investigator, the 
allegation was amended to a 'Violation of a Glass Bottle [on the beach] ordinance.  He was fined $40.00.  Neither of the Government's Exhibits (1 or 2) contains any mention of this 2003 incident.  
Applicant admitted the incident, but denies it was alcohol-related. His explanations are accompanied by documentation that the violation pertained to his possession of a glass container on a public 
beach, with no reference to the contents, if any, of the container (AX  F at page 3).  The Government has not carried its initial burden of establishing that an alcohol-related violation had taken place.  
I conclude that the violation  contains minimal, if any, security  significance.  </P> 
 
<P>1.b.  On May 14, 1997, Applicant was arrested in State B on two counts of  Burglary.  On July 15, 1997,  Applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of  Petit Theft.  He was fined $533.60, placed on 
probation for one year, and sentenced to serve 120 days in jail, with 90 days suspended.  Applicant admits allegation 1.b., which is describes in the  SOR as a felony, apparently because the arrest  is 
cited in the FBI Criminal History (GX 2) as  "F  Burg."  I understand that term to mean Felony Burglary.  However, copies of the original court documents refer to the violation as a misdemeanor 
(AX A, AX C, and AX D (the booking/arrest form)).  There is no reference to "felony" status on any of the police/court documents.  Under these unique circumstances, particularly since Applicant 
does not appear to have any legal background, his admission of an allegation that includes the term "felony" is not conclusive or binding. The overall evidence indicates the offense was always  
treated as a misdemeanor.</P> 
 
<P>1.c. - The falsification-related information cited in subparagraphs 2.a  and 2.b., below, does not establish any intent to deceive the Government.  For the reasons stated  below, this allegation is 
found in favor of Applicant. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>2.a. - Applicant is alleged to have falsified material facts on his May 24, 2004 security clearance application (SF 86), when he answered Question<STRONG> 21 Your Police Record - Felony Convictions</STRONG>, by 
saying "No," and failing to cite the 1997 felony arrest cited in 1.b., above.  However, the Government has not shown that Applicant  was arrested for a felony offense, as is alleged in 1.b.</P> 
 
<P>In fact, the offense was always treated as a misdemeanor, beginning with the arrest/booking report.  Therefore, he could  not have lied  by denying being charged with or convicted of a felony, 
because that did not happen. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>2.b. - Applicant is alleged to have falsified material facts on his May 24, 2004 security clearance application (SF 86), when he answered Question<STRONG> 24 Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug 
Convictions</STRONG>, by saying "No," and failing to cite the 2003 citation cited in 1.a., above. However, the Government has not established that this offense was alcohol-related . Therefore, he could  not 
have lied  by denying being charged with or convicted of an alcohol or drug related offense, because that did not happen. </P> 
 
<P>2.c. - In an interview  with a Special Agent of the Office of Personnel Management, on  January 18, 2005,  Applicant stated  that "he had never been arrested for a felony, had  never gone to court, 
and had  never been in jail, whereas Applicant, although not related to a felony, had gone to court, and served time in jail, as indicated in subparagraph 1.b., above."  The evidence shows  that 
Applicant  was present in court  on July 15, 1997, and  was sentenced to serve 120 days in jail, with 90 days suspended (AX C).</P> 
 
<P>The vice president of Applicant's employer speaks highly of  him and views him as a  "truthful person  who would not intentionally make any misstatements on his security [clearance] application" 
(AX  K). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors: (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall 
conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether 
it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of 
having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  </P> 
 
<P>If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it 
is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at 
E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>1.a.  The allegation, as amended at the hearing, is that Applicant was cited for violating a Glass Bottle [on the beach] ordinance in March 2003.  Applicant admitted the incident, which resulted in a 
citation, and led to a $40.00 fine. There is no suggestion in the record that the bottle contained alcohol and I note there is no allegation in the SOR under Guideline G (Alcohol). The ordinance was 
apparently aimed at protecting people on the beach from the danger of broken glass in the sand.  It appears that  the investigator originally thought Applicant  was speaking about an open container 
of alcohol, but Applicant insists that this was not the case, and nothing in the evidence contradicts him.  At the hearing the investigator admitted the error and the allegation  was amended to reflect 
that fact and the reference to an "Open Container of Alcohol" was deleted.   Nothing in the Government's documentation describes the violation as a felony or misdemeanor; it  was a violation of a 
city ordinance.  While the allegation as amended is found to be true, I find no current security clearance significance.     </P> 
 
<P>1.b.  Question 21 on the SF 86 asks: "Have you ever been <EM> charged with </EM>or <EM>convicted</EM> of any felony offense?"  The question does not ask if Applicant had ever been  <EM>arrested</EM> for a felony offense. 
(Compare with Question <STRONG>26 Your Police Record - Other Offenses, </STRONG>which asks  "if  you have been arrested  for, charged  with or convicted of any offense(s) not listed [in other questions]." </P> 
 
<P>The FBI Criminal History (GX 2) describes the offense as "F - Burg," which appears  to mean Felony Burglary.  FBI records are generally  very accurate, but not always.  They receive and enter 
information  from law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and that information is not always accurate or complete. That appears to be the case here, since the available court records 
clearly show  the offense being charged, and sentence imposed, as a misdemeanor.  Most important on this point is the 'Booking/Arrest Report, which states the Arrest Charge as being  "Petit 
Theft"  - M [isdemeanor]" (AX D; <EM>see also </EM>AX C). </P> 
 
<P>I have considered the testimony of the OPM investigator who interviewed Applicant.  He indicated a belief  that the SF 86 did ask about Applicant "being  arrested  for a felony" (Tr at 39, 40), but  
when shown  the SF 86,  realized the question  asked  was actually: "Have you ever been charged  with or convicted of a felony" (Id.).  The investigator also mentioned that the "have you ever" time 
frame applied to "felony arrests" and  that Applicant had answered  that "he had never been arrested for a felony" (Tr at 32, at line 7-15).  Clearly, he had not been so arrested. </P> 
 
<P>Whether Applicant understood  the difference in terminology  is not absolutely clear, but the same question applies to the OPM  investigator.  Since the Government has not shown that Applicant 
was "charged  with" and/or convicted of a felony, there is no valid basis for concluding that he had acted improperly in answering the question as he did.  The OPM investigator testified that he 
asked Applicant if he had ever been arrested for a felony, and that Applicant has responded "Yes," but that it had been reduced to a misdemeanor (Tr at 34). He also testified that Applicant admitted 
he had falsified his answers on the SF  86 and during the first interview, and that  he "really didn't  think that you would be able to find out, that it would come  up on a record check." (Tr at 35). 
The investigator added that Applicant stated  he knew he had been charged with a felony, but that it had been  reduced to a misdemeanor, [so that] he did not have to disclose that information or list 
it on the security questionnaire (Tr at 36).  This  testimony is denied by Applicant, and the original court/police records indicate that Applicant had not been charged with a felony. The investigator 
had not seen the State B court/police files during the investigation.</P> 
 
<P>The record does  not contain  a  written  report of the interview, and the investigator, at some point prior to the hearing, had shredded his notes of the interview. He testified, apparently, from 
memory (Tr at 38).  Applicant appears to have been unsophisticated legally, and I conclude that he was focusing on felony-related information  and was not thinking separately about appearing in  
court and serving  jail time in a non-felony situation. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's  wife testified that she was present at the 2003 incident, having just come out of a restroom.  She saw her husband holding a bottle of beer and speaking with a police officer.  The 
violation that was being discussed  was the possession of the glass bottle, and  had nothing to do with its contents, since beer was not prohibited on the beach (Tr at 50).  Applicant has worked for 
his  present employer since June 1998.  His Senior Program Manager, with 37 years experience, rates Applicant as  "number one, absolutely," among the project engineers with whom he has  
worked (Tr at 57, 58).  He does not think that Applicant "would intentionally  mislead or lie to an investigator in his security clearance" (Tr at 60).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant served four years in the U.S. Air Force and held a security clearance (Tr at 63).</P> 
 
<P>As to the 1997 matter, Applicant knew only that he was charged with a misdemeanor. Neither his lawyer nor anyone else ever mentioned the word "felony" and he never "understood that [he] had 
been charged by the prosecutor with a felony" (Tr at 76, 77).  I conclude that he did not intentionally omit  any  material information.  In summary, I conclude that the lack of an admitted or 
otherwise  proven felony charge and/or conviction  makes  points 2 and 3 not material, and therefore not a basis for an adverse determination.  </P> 
 
<P>On cross examination, the OPM investigator stated that a recheck of police records showed that the offense was actually "dumping rubbish on a beach," and there was no mention of alcohol </P> 
 
<P>(Tr at 43).  As to the burglary allegation, the investigator admitted that he had not looked at the State A court files, including the charging documents, none of which  mentioned the word  "Felony" 
(Tr at 45, 46).  His only source for the allegation of a felony arrest  was that Applicant told him it was for two counts of felony Burglary (Tr at 44).  Yet, Applicant denies this allegation and it is 
contradicted by other evidence.</P> 
 
<P>1.c. The validity of this alleged criminal violation depends on whether Applicant intentionally falsified material facts on his May 2004 SF 86 about the 1997 and 2003 incidents alleged under 1.a. 
and 1.b., above. As discussed below, the Government has not shown that Applicant deliberately falsified any material facts in his SF 86 or in his sworn statement to the DSS agent.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Criminal Conduct </EM>- The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Condition: E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 2003 citation has not been shown to be a criminal offense and the 1997 arrest, conviction, and sentencing  was for a misdemeanor. Neither episode qualifies as a "serious crime" under DOHA 
precedent and the 1997 matter is this a single "lesser offense."  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Conditions: E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent (misdemeanor burglary in 1997;  the glass bottle on beach ordinance was a criminal violation in 2003.  In any case, it was 
almost three and half years ago, and is deemed not recent;  E2.A10.1.3.2. Considering the nature and timing of the two matters, I deem them  to be an isolated matter, particularly since the 2003 
violation has not been shown to be a criminal violation and the misdemeanor violation was nine years ago; E2.A10.1.3.6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, as evidenced by 
Applicant's life and accomplishments over the last nine years, as shown by the overall record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</EM></STRONG><EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>2.a. The flaw in the Government's position is that it has not proved under 1.b. that a felony was committed in 1997 and that Applicant had been charged with or with convicted of a felony.  No 
mitigation is required, since Applicant did not lie about a material matter. Assuming that Applicant's failure to report the court appearance and his incarceration in 1997 can/should be considered 
separately from the felony," it does not appear to be material under any other question in the SF 86 and would therefore not be security significant under the SOR in this case. </P> 
 
<P>2.b. The Government has failed to show  the 2003 offense alleged in 1.a. was alcohol-related.  Consequently, no mitigation  is required,. since Applicant did not lie about a material matter.</P> 
 
<P>2.c. The remaining issue is whether the Applicant lied about material facts to the OPM investigator on  January 18, 2005 interview.  The allegation cites three points relating, to 1.b., above:</P> 
 
<P>(1). that Applicant was arrested for a felony;</P> 
 
<P>(2) that Applicant had gone to court;</P> 
 
<P>(3) that Applicant had served time in jail.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered "No" on all three points.  As to point (1), I find Applicant's explanations to be credible and consistent  with other evidence. Applicant  was not arrested for a felony.  Points (2). 
and (3) are literally true if considered separately,  since Applicant did  go to court and did serve some time in  jail.  </P> 
 
<P>It can be argued that Applicant's "no" answers were intended to persuade the investigator  not to go into any more detail or ask  more questions or to check criminal records,  even though he did tell 
the investigator about the 2003 citation. Applicant has not shown any legal sophistication and has been cooperative.   </P> 
 
<P>In addition, his consistent testimony has been that  he believed the investigator was asking a three part question about a felony arrest and it consequences, and he answered "No" to all three parts 
because there had not ben any felony arrest.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Personal Conduct </EM>- The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Conditions: None that have been established by the record.  <EM>Assuming</EM>, <EM>arguendo,</EM> that Applicant should have answered "Yes" to Points (2) and (3), they constitute an isolated incident 
that occurred some three years ago.       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's other two witnesses, who have a total of 75 years experience with classified information between them have highly positive opinion of Applicant and have great deal of  confidence in 
his ability t protect our nation's secrets (Tr at 55-87, and 113).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Based on the entire record, I conclude that (1) the Government has not substantiated some of the allegations,  and (2) Applicant has mitigated the remainder.  I further conclude that Applicant has 
been a valued and highly productive employee for many years, and has demonstrated that he possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of someone seeking access to the 
nation's secrets.</P>
