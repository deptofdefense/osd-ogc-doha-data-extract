<P>Applicant is a 63-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States.  One of Applicant's brothers continues to live in Hong Kong and Applicant maintains regular 
contact with him.  She also has extensive ties to the United States.  Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor for over 19 years and has held a 
security clearance for over 12 years without incident.  All her other family members, including her children, are citizens and residents of the United States or 
Canada.  All of Applicant's financial assets are in the United States, including real estate, savings, and investments.  Applicant has mitigated the security 
concerns arising from the possible foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On January 31, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  Under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  On February 12, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges 
security concerns raised under the Directive, Guideline B, Foreign Influence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 10, 2004.  She elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
 
<P>Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P>The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline B of the 
Directive.  Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.</EM>"  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "<EM>immediate family members</EM>" to 
include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  The evidence indicates that Applicant's brother is a resident of Hong Kong, and 
Applicant maintains regular, although somewhat sporadic, contact with him.</P> 
 
<P>These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P>These security concerns can be mitigated where it is determined that "<EM>the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States</EM>."  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  In this case, Applicant's brother in Hong Kong is not an "agent of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).</P> 
 
<P><EM></EM>In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the character of the government of the relevant 
foreign country.  The People's Republic of China is an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.  Ex. 3 at 1. It has a poor record of 
protecting human rights.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Its interests are hostile to the United States.  Since 1997, Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of China, which 
enjoys a high degree of autonomy, except in defense and foreign affairs.  Ex. 3 at 47.  Hong Kong remains a free society, and its citizens have rights protected 
by law.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The government of Hong Kong generally respects the human rights of its residents.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 48.  The possibility exists that the government would 
attempt to exploit or pressure its residents to act adversely to the interests of the United States, but the risk is not as great as in the P.R.C.<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's brother in Hong Kong.  As noted above, Applicant's brother is not and has never been an 
employee of the government or the military, nor does he rely upon a government pension.  He operates an independent family business.  His financial position 
is such that he can travel abroad if desired.  Under these circumstances, the opportunity for adverse influence is substantially reduced.<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through her ties with her brother.  Applicant has strong familial 
and emotional ties to her brother in Hong Kong.  At the same time, she has extensive ties to the United States.  She has lived here most of her life, her children 
live here, and the rest of her family members live in the United States or Canada.  All her financial interests are in the United States.  She has worked for this 
defense contractor for over 19 years and has substantial professional and financial ties to the company.  Finally, she has held a security clearance since 1992 
without adverse incident.  Considering the extent of her ties to the United States, it appears Applicant is not unusually vulnerable to pressure or duress.  I 
conclude the mitigating condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive applies.<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case.  I conclude any potential security concerns arising from Applicant's family ties to Hong Kong 
are mitigated by Applicant's extensive interests in the United States.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>My conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1, Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.<EM></EM></P>
