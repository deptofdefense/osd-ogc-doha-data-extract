  According to Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum implementing 10 U.S.C. 986, that statute: (a) precludes DoD personnel from granting or continuing a security clearance for a person covered by the statute; (b) applies to convictions in either state or federal courts; and (c) applies if there has been an  imposition of a sentence of imprisonment regardless of what time, if any, the convicted person actually serves.  Board does not have jurisdiction or authority to  review or pass judgment on Deputy Secretary of Defense's interpretation of 10 U.S.C. 986 or his guidance concerning implementation of that statute.  State  pardon does not affect applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986.  A state conviction with imposition of a sentence of imprisonment of term exceeding one year is covered  by 10 U.S.C. 986 even if that conviction is latter set aside under state law.  Adverse decision affirmed.  Board does not recommend further consideration of the  case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Kenneth C. Smith, Jr., Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued a decision, dated May 1, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by denying Applicant a security clearance based on 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986; and (2) whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 if the Board concludes Applicant's 
case falls under that statute.  The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision, and does not recommend that Applicant's case 
be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 24, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).  A hearing was held on March 12, 2002.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated May 1, 2002, in which he concluded it 
is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant submitted two letters that were not part of the record before the Administrative Judge.  One of the documents is a letter of reference that 
constitutes new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM>, Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  The other document is a letter from 
Applicant that asks the Board to consider certain evidence that he believes "has been completely ignored and overlooked."  Because Applicant's letter 
essentially sets forth a kind of argument, it is not new evidence precluded from consideration on appeal.  Accordingly, Applicant's letter can be considered to 
the extent it presents an argument for the Board to consider.</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by denying Applicant a security clearance based on 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</SPAN>.  Under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Department of 
Defense (DoD) may not grant or renew a security clearance for a defense contractor official or employee that falls under any of four statutory categories [10 
U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) through (c)(4)].  The statutory category that is at issue in this case is 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1), which provides that: "The person has been 
convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."  The Administrative Judge concluded that 
Applicant's 1972 and 1989 convictions fall under that statutory category.</P> 
<P>Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by basing his adverse security clearance decision on 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 because: (a) the statutory prohibition is 
permissive, not mandatory, in nature; (b) the statutory prohibition applies only to convictions in federal courts and does not apply to convictions in state courts; 
(c) the statutory prohibition does not apply to cases where an individual received a suspended sentence; (d) Applicant's 1989 conviction no longer stands; (e) if 
there is any ambiguity concerning the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to Applicant's case, such ambiguity must be resolved in Applicant's favor; and (f) the June 
7, 2001 memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense that implements 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is not controlling and is not binding on the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals.</P> 
<P>Applicant's first, second, third, and sixth arguments can be discussed and resolved together.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a June 7, 2001 
memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  Our reading of the June 7, 2001 memorandum persuades us that the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense has indicated it is the position of DoD that:</P> 
<P>(a) 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precludes DoD personnel from granting or continuing a security clearance for a person covered by that the statute;</P> 
<P>(b) 10 U.S.C.&sect;986(c)(1) applies to convictions in either state courts or federal courts; and</P> 
<P>(c) 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) applies if there has been an imposition of a sentence of imprisonment regardless of what time, if any, the convicted person actually 
serves.</P> 
<P>The Board does not have the jurisdiction or authority to review or pass judgment on the Deputy Secretary of Defense's interpretation of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 or his 
guidance concerning implementation of that statute.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-05323 (July 25, 2002) at p. 3 (explaining limits of Board's authority).  Accordingly, 
the Board rejects Applicant's sixth argument, and concludes it lacks the jurisdiction or authority to address the merits of Applicant's first, second and third 
arguments beyond concluding that application of the June 7, 2001 memorandum precludes acceptance of those  arguments.</P> 
<P>Applicant's argument that his 1989 conviction no longer stands raises an issue not addressed by the June 7, 2001 memorandum.  Specifically, Applicant argues 
the Administrative Judge erred by applying 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to his 1989 conviction because: (a) he received a state pardon in September 1994 and was restored 
to his rights in the state where he was convicted; and (b) in March 2002, Applicant was acquitted of the 1989 matter and the prosecution dismissed.  Applicant's 
arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge erred by applying 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P>Applicant's 1994 state pardon does not affect the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to the adjudication of his security clearance case.  Under the Supremacy 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution,<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> federal law has primacy over state law.  Congress is not bound by state law in determining what effect to give to a state 
pardon under federal law.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, whatever effect Applicant's 1994 state pardon may have under state law, Congress is not compelled to recognize or 
accept that state pardon for purposes of federal statutes.  Nothing in 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 indicates what effect a state pardon should have on its application.  But, the 
silence of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 does not mean that Applicant's argument about the effect of his 1994 state pardon can be accepted.  There are two reasons why the 
silence of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 about state pardons precludes a conclusion that such pardons nullify or affect the prohibition set forth under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1).  
First, because the federal government is not bound to follow state law unless there is express Congressional direction to the contrary,<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> the silence of 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986 means Congress has not directed the DoD to recognize or give effect to a state pardon in connection with application of that statute to security clearance 
adjudications.  Second, 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 itself expressly provides for only one way to avoid the terms of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1): a meritorious waiver made 
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  When Congress provides for any exception to the application of a statute, the courts will not infer the existence of other 
exceptions, but rather will assume Congress considered the matter of exceptions and decided to limit the statute to the exceptions listed therein.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, 
the express listing of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d) as the only exception to the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) means Congress did not intend to allow other 
exceptions to the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1).  For these reasons, the Board concludes Applicant's 1994 state pardon does not render the Administrative 
Judge's application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>In the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, it is to be assumed that Congress does not intend to make the application of a federal statute dependent on 
state law.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  When Congress wants a provision of federal law to depend or rely on state law, it does so by explicit statutory language.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Unless Congress has 
specifically indicated that state law controls, what constitutes a "conviction" for purposes of a federal statute is a question of federal law.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, unless 
Congress has specifically indicated that state law controls, what constitutes "sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year" for purposes of 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) is a question of federal law, not state law.  Since nothing in the statute indicates Congress intended the DoD to be bound by state law 
concerning what constitutes a conviction, Applicant's reliance on details of state law is misplaced.</P> 
<P>When Congress has not indicated that state law should apply in determining whether a person is a convicted felon under a federal statute, the federal courts 
consider the practical reality of whether a person has been convicted, not the particular labels that may be used to describe the person's status.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, 
Congress may attach federal disabilities on a person based on an expunged state conviction regardless of the effect the expungement has under state law.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P>  In 
this case, there is no dispute that Applicant was convicted in 1989 and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.  For purposes of 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986, the existence of Applicant's 1989 conviction is not negated or nullified by state action in March 2002 which sets aside that conviction, dismisses the 
prosecution, and declares that dismissal of the prosecution has the same effect under state law as an acquittal.</P> 
<P>Applicant's fifth argument also is not persuasive.  Applicant cites no legal authority for his claim that any ambiguity concerning the application of 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986 must be resolved in his favor.  Furthermore, acceptance of Applicant's fifth argument would have the practical effect of allowing doubts to be resolved in 
favor of an applicant instead of in favor of the national security.  The Supreme Court has made clear that, in the area of security clearance decisions, the federal 
government is entitled to resolve doubts in favor of the national security.<A HREF="01-00407.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  And, in any event, Applicant has failed to show any ambiguity concerning the 
application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to his case.  In view of the foregoing, the Board rejects Applicant's fifth argument.</P> 
<P>For all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes Applicant's case is covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, and the Administrative Judge did not err by applying that 
statute in this case.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</SPAN>.  Applicant argues the Board should 
recommend that his case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 if it concludes that statute applies.  Department Counsel contends the Judge's 
decision would have been adverse under Guideline J "whether or not 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 was in place."  If Department Counsel's contention were correct, there 
would be no need for the Board to consider whether to recommend that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
<P>Department Counsel's contention is unpersuasive for two reasons.  First, if the Administrative Judge had intended to render an adverse decision under 
Guideline J without applying 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, then it would not make any sense for the Judge to address whether to recommend a waiver under that statute.  
Second, the following language appears in the decision below: "I conclude that this is a case where my decision to deny or revoke is 'solely a result of 10 USC. 
&sect;986.'"  Department Counsel does not articulate any reason why the Board should ignore that language.  Accordingly, the Board concludes the issue of a waiver 
under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is raised by this appeal and must be addressed.</P> 
<P>Under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the DoD may not grant or renew a security clearance for a defense contractor official or employee that falls under any of four statutory 
categories [10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) through (c)(4)].  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned 
may authorize an exception to the statutory prohibition against granting or renewing a security clearance for cases covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) or 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986(c)(4).</P> 
<P>In the June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, 
DOHA is the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
<P>"In any case in which the Administrative Judge, or the Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
<P>Under paragraph 2.f. of the Operating Instruction, the Board is responsible for resolving any appeal as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  For the reasons 
stated earlier in this decision, Applicant's case is covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P>Having concluded that this case is covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, all that remains for the Board to do is consider Applicant's request that it recommend further 
consideration of his case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  Such a request, however, places the Board in an unusual situation.  The Operating Instruction 
does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  Furthermore, under the 
Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver be 
considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986" or (2) "The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own 
capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its 
obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Under the terms of the DoD memorandum implementing 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1): "The person has been convicted in 
any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Judge's conclusion 
that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded him from making a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in Applicant's request that the Board recommend his case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  The Board reaches this conclusion for the following reasons: (1) the Board does not have the authority to 
review the Administrative Judge's recommendation that Applicant's case not be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d); and (2) the Board is 
precluded from giving an explanation for its own recommendation concerning waiver.</P> 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
