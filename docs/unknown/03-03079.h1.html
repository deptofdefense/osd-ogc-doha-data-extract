<P>The Applicant's debt situation arose primarily from his divorce, which concluded in 2001.  Since that time, as his financial situation has improved, the 
Applicant has made efforts at paying off his overdue debt.  His current financial situation is stable and he shows every indication that he will successfully 
resolve his remaining debt situation.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing through counsel on March 26, 2004, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The 
Department Counsel submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on July 28, 2004.  The case was received by the undersigned for 
Decision on November 1, 2004.  The Department Counsel subsequently submitted the FORM to Applicant's counsel on June 15, 2005.  The Applicant's 
counsel was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any additional information to the Administrative Judge.  Applicant's counsel submitted 
additional information on July 14, 2005.  The Department Counsel submitted additional information on August 1, 2005.  The record closed on that date. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 32.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Operations Manager, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his 
employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts in order to generate funds.  Such conduct may also show poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant admitted that he was indebted to this department store in the amount of $336.00 on a past due account.  However, an analysis of the exhibits 
shows that, while the account was charged off, the $336.00 figure was the credit limit.  (Item 7 at 5.)  The 2004 and 2005 credit reports do not show a past due 
figure for this account.  (Item 8 at 2 and Item 9 at 2.)  Notwithstanding his admission, the Government has not proved this debt.  This allegation is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant denied owing the Defense Finance and Accounting Service $380.00.  This debt does not appear in the 2004 and 2005 credit reports (Items 8 
and 9).  The Government submitted no information, other than a 2002 credit report (Item 7), to support this allegation.  It is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant admitted owing this creditor $888.00 on a past due account.  Item 9 at page 2 states regarding this creditor, "Settlement accepted on this 
account."  Accordingly, I find that this debt has been resolved.  This allegation is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant admitted owing this creditor $779.35 on a past due account.  The 2005 credit report shows that this debt is still outstanding.  (Item 9 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant admitted owing this creditor $507.88 on a past due account.  The 2005 credit report shows that this debt is still outstanding.  (Item 9 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant admitted owing this department store $2,226.94 on a past due account.  The 2005 credit report shows that this debt is still outstanding.  
(Item 9 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g.  The Applicant admitted owing this department store $1,707.57 on a past due account.  The 2005 credit report shows that this debt is still outstanding.  
(Item 9 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h.  The Applicant admitted owing this bank $8,111.00, the balance owed after resale of an automobile.  This debt does not appear in the 2004 or 2005 credit 
reports (Items 8 and 9).  However, there is no evidence that the debt has been resolved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i.  The Applicant admitted owing this telephone company $468.82 on a past due account.  This debt does not appear in the 2004 or 2005 credit reports (Items 
8 and 9).  The 2005 credit report indicates that the Applicant has an unpaid telephone bill in the amount of $77.00.  This may be the debt set forth in this 
subparagraph or 1.k.  (Item 9 at 1.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.j.  The Applicant denied owing this debt in the amount of $145.00.  Item 9 at 1 shows this item as "Paid."  This allegation is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.k.  The Applicant admitted owing this telephone company $296.00 on a past due account.  This debt does not appear in the 2004 or 2005 credit reports (Items 
8 and 9).  The 2005 credit report indicates that the Applicant has an unpaid telephone bill in the amount of $77.00.  This may be the debt set forth in this 
subparagraph or 1.i.  (Item 9 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l.  The Applicant admitted owing this credit card company $2,300.00 on a past due account.  It appears that this debt has been transferred or sold.  Item 9 at 
page 2 shows the current balance to be $5,318.00.  There is no evidence that the debt has been resolved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.m.  The Applicant admitted that he was past due on a student loan.  Item 9 at 3 shows that he is making current payments on his student loan.  This allegation 
is found for the Applicant.  (<EM>See</EM>, Answer to SOR (Answer) at Enclosure 5.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.n. The Applicant was divorced in 2001.  He was awarded full custody of his young daughter at that time.  In 2001, he was making $18,000.00 a year.  By the 
time the Answer to the SOR was filed in March 2004, he was making $41,000.00 a year.  (Answer at 2.)  As of July 13, 2005, the Applicant states he is making 
approximately $60,000.00 a year.  (Response to FORM (Response) at Enclosure 1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant states that he was in the process of arranging a debt consolidation for his debts.  (Answer at 2, and Enclosure 4.)  The 
Response does not show that the Applicant has made any further steps towards a debt consolidation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning his current debt situation, the Applicant states, "My total payments for debts and mortgage is $2107 per month.  My take home pay is $3610 per 
month.  Thus I can quite comfortably meet my financial obligations, my monthly living expenses and pay additional money against my outstanding debts."  
(Response at Enclosure 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 2004 credit report indicates that the Applicant had a total past due indebtedness of $9,942.00.  (Item 8 at 3.)  The 2005 credit report shows that the past due 
indebtedness had been reduced to $9,456.00.  (Item 9 at 3.)  The Applicant contends, and the available records indicate, that he has not created more past due 
debt in the recent past.  In addition, he submitted evidence showing that he is making timely payments on his current debts.  (Answer at Enclosures 5, 6, 7, 8 
and 9; Response at Enclosure 2.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case shall be set 
forth under "Conclusions," below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of financial irresponsibility  that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial 
obligations.  Disqualifying Condition E2.A6.1.2.1 applies to the facts of this case, <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his conduct.  Most, if not all, of the past due debts occurred during the time leading up to his divorce 
from his wife in 2001.  Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.1 applies, <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., 
loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>.  The fact that the debts were incurred four or 
more years ago, and that he has been able to remain current on his present indebtedness for a prolonged period of time, brings Mitigating Condition 
E2.A6.1.3.1. into effect, <EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>.  Finally, the records show that he has made efforts over the last few years to pay off his past due debts as 
his financial situation has improved.  Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.6. applies, <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts</EM>.  The Applicant has not completely resolved his debt situation, but he has made tremendous strides and shows every indication of 
continuing to pay the remainder off in a timely manner.  Under the whole person concept, and considering all the available evidence, he has mitigated the 
security significance of his conduct.  Guideline F is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. </SPAN></P>
