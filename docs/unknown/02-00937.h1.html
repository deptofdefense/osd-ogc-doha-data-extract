<P>Forty-six-year-old applicant had financial problems after he retired from the U.S. Army.  He failed to resolve debts totaling over $35,000 until he filed for 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy after the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals declined to grant him a security clearance.  He deliberately omitted relevant and 
material information about these debts from his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 30 January 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR), under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-00937.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-00937.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
18 March and 1 May 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 14 July 2003.  On 11 September 2003, 
I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 29 September 2003.  Applicant's Exhibits O, P, and Q were admitted into evidence after the hearing, without 
objection from Department Counsel.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old high school graduate who retired from the U.S. Army in 1996.  Ex. 1 at 1, 6; Tr. 9.  His transition to civilian life was difficult.  He 
was initially unable to find work and, when he did, the pay was not sufficient to meet his bills.  He fell behind on several accounts and stopped making 
payments.  From 1996 when he retired until the date of the hearing, Applicant's salary increased from approximately $10 to $23 an hour.  Tr. 13.  The following 
chart summarizes the alleged delinquencies and status.</P>

<TD></TD></TR></TABLE> 
 
<P>Applicant never attempted to get any credit counseling.  Tr. 32.  During his interview with a Defense Security Service agent on 29 May 2001, Applicant was 
unsure how he was going to meet his financial obligations.  He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2003.  Ex. A.  Applicant pays $1,023 each month to the 
court to satisfy his creditors.  </P> 
 
<P>On 8 September 1999, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).  Ex. 1.  Applicant answered "no" to the following questions in the SCA:</P> 
 
<P>37. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?</P> 
 
<P>39. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had several delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1-a. - 1.d.), an unpaid judgment (&para; 1.e.), a debt to the IRS of $3,500 for unpaid taxes for 
tax years 1998-2000 (&para; 1.f.), and monthly income that exceeded his monthly expenses by $723 (&para; 1.g.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk 
of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence, and Applicant's admissions, the delinquent accounts alleged in &para;&para; 1.a. - 1.f.  Applicant has a history of not 
meeting financial obligations (DC 1) and was either unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC 3).  Applicant initiated efforts to resolve his debts by filing for 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  <EM>See</EM> MC 6.  But it took him several years to do so.  In May 2001, Applicant suggested to the DSS agent that he might file for 
bankruptcy.  He finally filed for bankruptcy two years later and several months after receiving the SOR.  Meanwhile, his financial statement reflected that, after 
paying all of his other bills and expenses, Applicant was netting $723 a month.  (Ex. 2 at 8)  There is no evidence he used this money to pay off any of his 
delinquent debts.  This is not the good-faith effort required by MC 6.  Under the circumstances, finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegation in &para; 1.g. does not meet any of the disqualifying conditions under Guideline F.  It is merely evidence appropriate for consideration as to the 
guideline's disqualifying and mitigating conditions.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by failing to acknowledge an unpaid judgment (&para; 2.a.) and 
debts on which he was more than 90 days delinquent (&para; 2.b.).  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A5.l.l.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that Applicant incorrectly answered questions 37 and 39 on his SCA.  The open question is whether Applicant did so deliberately.  
Applicant insists that he did not deliberately omit information on his financial status from his SCA.  He claims he believed he did not have to report debts that 
were charged off and he was unable to locate addresses for other creditors.  Tr. 42.  He also asserts he did not understand the question about judgments and he 
was unaware the paperwork he received was a judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In judging Applicant's credibility, I considered the testimony of his character witness and the statements on his behalf admitted into evidence, in addition to his 
testimony and demeanor.  On the other hand, Applicant never provided a credible reason for failing to list his three years of tax delinquencies to the IRS in his 
answer to question 39.  I am convinced Applicant deliberately omitted relevant and material facts from his answers to questions 37 and 39 on his SCA.  DC 2.   
None of the listed mitigating conditions apply.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P>
