<P>On 12<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> July 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a  Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-03359.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 10 and 27 
August 2001, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. On 3 October 2001, Applicant responded  to the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 25 September 2001. The record in this case closed 16 October 2001--the day Department Counsel 
indicated no objection to the response. The case was originally assigned to a different administrative judge, but was reassigned to me on 12 December 2001 
because of caseload considerations; I received the case the same day to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the criminal allegations of the SOR with explanation, but denied intentionally falsifying her clearance application; accordingly, I incorporate 
those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 34-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 23 November 1997, Applicant falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP)(SF 86) when she answered "no" to a question designed to 
elicit whether Applicant had any police record not covered by other questions on the QNSP:<A HREF="01-03359.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>23. YOUR POLICE RECORD For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken 
from the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the 
court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>. . . f. In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? 
(Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In fact, Applicant had been arrested on 22 September 1993 and charged with third degree theft. According to Applicant's sworn statement on 27 July 2000 
(Item 5):</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The shoplifting case was when I was with a friend in [store]. We were looking at some jewelry. When we left the store nothing was taken off me. We did have 
to bond out of jail, but I can't even remember being finger printed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant admits the allegation of the SOR, that she was convicted and fined $300.00 plus court costs, the court records (Item 7) reflect the 
disposition as "bond forfeited," with no further information to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the two stated dispositions.  Applicant's 10 August 
2001 answer (Item 3) sheds little additional light on the issue:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . I was with a friend shipping in a local department store. The time slipped up on us (she had to pick up her mother). So we proceeded to leave the store. She 
had on a watch that was found on her. I had tried on several watches; they must not have seen me replace the merchandise. No merchandise was ever found in 
my possession. I don't recall paying a fine or anything.<A HREF="01-03359.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The disposition of this offense notwithstanding, Applicant offers no explanation for her omitting the arrest on her QNSP.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1998, Applicant was indicted by a local grand jury for obtaining over $7,000.00 in food stamps and other financial assistance by deception between 
June 1996 and June 1997. She was arrested in September 1999, and ultimately pleaded guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge of unauthorized possession of 
food stamps. She was ordered to make restitution of the full value of the indictment amount, given a one-year suspended sentence, and two years of 
probation--to run to December 2001. Applicant asserts some confusion over her eligibility for food stamps and financial assistance, but acknowledges that she 
did not report obtaining employment, because the employment was part-time (Items 3, 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's response to the FORM contains her plea to retain her clearance, but neither the response nor the FORM contain any evidence of successful 
rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's deliberate falsification of her police record to an agency of the federal government on 
matters within that agency's jurisdiction clearly violate 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. The falsifications had the potential to influence the course of the background 
investigation--in areas of legitimate concern to the Government. Applicant's two convictions in 1999 and 1993--while clearly less significant than the 
falsification--nevertheless cast doubt on Applicant's fitness for access to classified information. I find Guideline J. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant knew she had a 1993 shoplifting arrest and conviction, and deliberately failed to disclose 
that incidents.<A HREF="01-03359.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant offered no explanation for this omission which had the potential to influence the course of the background investigation. I find

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996, and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant is also alleged to have falsely answered "no" to question 29: Public Record Civil Court Actions, In the past 7 years, have you been a party to any 
public record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?, because she sued a local grocery for negligence in April 1995. Applicant denies falsifying 
this information, claiming that she did not recall seeing the question, and may have interpreted the question as asking if she had ever been sued herself. 
Although the plain language of the question does not support that interpretation, I can nevertheless understand where a lay person might read that interpretation 
into the question. Applicant's misapprehension of the question is sufficient to vitiate the required intent to falsify. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant essentially reiterated this version in her 27 August 2001 answer (Item 3). 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>For the reasons stated in my Findings of Fact, I conclude that Applicant did not deliberately withhold the fact that she had sued a local grocery for personal 
injury.
