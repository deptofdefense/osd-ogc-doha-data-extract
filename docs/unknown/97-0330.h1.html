</P>

<P>	On May 9, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive
Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992
(Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a written statement dated May 14, 1997, sworn to and signed on May 27,
1997, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  A
copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on June 13, 1997.  The
undersigned held a hearing on August 12, 1997.  The Department Counsel presented six exhibits
("Exhs") and the testimony of no witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of the presentation of
three exhibits and his own testimony.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the transcript
("Tr") of the hearing on August 21, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on a single criterion:
paragraph 1, Criterion G (alcohol consumption).  The Applicant has admitted<A NAME="admitted or denied subparas.?"></A> the factual allegations
contained in each subparagraph of the SOR, other than SOR &para; 1.i.  Except as noted herein, the
Applicant's admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 29-year-old senior electronics install technician employed by a U.S. Gov-ernment contractor.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Applicant has consumed alcohol since he was about 15 years old, periodically to the
point of intoxication, until June 14, 1997.  He enlisted in military service when he was 18 years old
in 1986 and served on active duty until his honorable discharge in January 1994.  While on active
duty the Applicant received non-judicial punishment twice for alcohol-related incidents.  Exh. 5. 
He was also convicted in 1989 for drinking in public (open container) and in 1990 for Driving While
Intoxicated (0.17% BAC).  Shortly after the latter arrest, the Applicant deployed overseas in support
of Operation Desert Storm.  Upon his return from that deployment, his military service required him
to be admitted to an inpatient treatment program at one of its alcohol rehabilitation centers on July
23, 1991.  Tr page 41.  He completed that program on August 30, 1991, and participated in the
recommended aftercare.  Tr pages 42-43.</P>

<P>	Several weeks after his discharge in January 1994 the Applicant was placed on two weeks'
leave without pay by his employer after he missed boarding a departing ship on which he was
assigned to work.  He had overslept after drinking the night before in celebration of his 26th
birthday.  Exh. 3, page 3.  On July 15, 1994, the Applicant was involved in an automobile accident
in which the other driver was issued a citation.  However, the Applicant tested at 0.08% BAC (after
drinking about four beers over a two-hour period) and was charged with Driving Under the Influence
of Alcohol (DUI).  Tr pages 44-45.  During January-April 1995 he attended and successfully
completed an alcohol safe driving education course and a comprehensive substance abuse program. 
Each course involved his weekly attendance.  The DUI charge was dismissed in court.  He has not
had any  alcohol-related incidents within the past three years.  Tr page 52.</P>

<P>	The Applicant met his wife in March 1994 and married her on October 13, 1995.  They
gained custody of her two sons from a previous marriage in April 1996.  The Applicant decided with
his wife to "clean up their act" thereafter to deny any opportunity for someone to take the children
away from them.  Tr pages 35-38, 40.  He has taken on new responsibilities with his marriage and
no longer thinks that his personal decisions affect only himself.  Tr pages 47, 51-52.  He has matured
considerably and his life has changed dramatically since his marriage.  Tr pages 54, 58.  His last
drink was a beer the evening before Father's Day 1997.  Tr page 49.  The Applicant no longer has
the desire to drink and probably would not drink even if he had the desire for alcohol.  Tr page 50. 
He has good job recommendations from his supervisors, both from his previous employer and from
his current employer.</P>

</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION G - ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses,
and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified
information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include:</STRONG>  </P>

<P>			  (1)	alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or
spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to
alcohol use; </P>

<P>			  (2)	alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting
for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired
condition, or drinking on the job; </P>

<P>			  (4)	habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point
of impaired judgment; </P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>			  (2)	the problem occurred a number of years ago and there
is no indication of a recent problem;</P>

<P>			  (3)	positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety; </P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0330.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0330.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of the witness who testified, the
undersigned concludes that the Applicant successfully rebutted and overcame the Government's case
with regard to Criterion G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant had five alcohol-related accidents while in the service in 1988-94 and another
that affected his job performance shortly after his military discharge in 1994.  This conduct falls
within the scope of DC #1 and DC #2, identified on pages 3-4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  He had a pattern of binge
drinking that at times impaired his judgment within the meaning of DC #4, identified on page 4
<EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>. On the other hand, he has never been diagnosed as an alcoholic, an alcohol abuser, or as
alcohol dependent by any credentialed medical professional within the meaning of DC #3 and MC
#4.  This is the state of the evidence in the record before this Administrative Judge notwithstanding
the fact that he received inpatient treatment in 1991.  His is a history of youthful over-indulgence
and irresponsibility while single and in the service.  There is substantial credible evidence that, with
his marriage in 1995 and his new-found responsibility for stepchildren, he has made very significant
alterations in his outlook and  behavior supportive of sobriety.  This falls within the scope of MC
#3, identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  While he still drinks on occasion, he has not had an alcohol-related
incident in more than three years, and there is little indication that he has had a problem consuming
alcohol in those three years.  This falls within the scope of MC #2, also identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>. 
His behavior on and off the job in recent years demonstrates a commitment to reliable conduct, to
the use of good judgment, and particularly to responsible and lawful drinking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Directive requires that the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive,
identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, be considered, as appropriate, in making this decision.  The nature and
seriousness of his former drinking pattern weigh against the Applicant, although his age and immat-urity during which it occurred is viewed in mitigation.  His former pattern of intoxication did not
occur within the recent past and took place under personal circumstances unrepresentative of his
current situation.  There is a high probability that he will not abuse alcohol in the future.  Therefore,
SOR &para; 1 is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</FONT></P>
