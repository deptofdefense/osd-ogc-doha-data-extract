<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On May 17, 2005, DOHA issued an amended SOR. The SOR and 
its amendment, which are in essence the administrative complaint, allege security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline J, criminal 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In sworn statements, dated March 1, 2005, and May 23, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. In his SOR responses, 
Applicant admitting the allegations under Guideline B, foreign influence, and denied the allegations under Guideline J, criminal conduct, with an explanation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on May 25, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on June 3, 2005, scheduling the hearing for June 23, 2005. The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled. The government submitted four exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4. Applicant objected to GE 3. The basis of 
the objection was the document (a military report of disciplinary action) was not complete because it did not include a page that included the disposition of the 
case. The government counsel's position was that this document was the complete document that was provided. I admitted the document, but would determine 
the appropriate weight to give it based on  the issues raised. The other documents were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his 
own behalf, and had four witnesses testify for him. Applicant submitted eleven exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-K, and were admitted 
into the record without objection. The transcript was received on July 5, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 31-year-old computer specialist who has worked for a federal contractor since 2001, and before that as a contractor for a federal contractor since 
2000. Applicant served in the military from 1992 to 1997 and held a top secret clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married three times and divorced twice. He was first married when he was 19 years old from 1993 to 1997. On July 19, 1996, Applicant was 
arrested by military police for assault consummated by a battery on his wife. Applicant denied the charge. He claims his then wife was living with a  male 
companion and the companion  called in a report to have Applicant arrested. The charges were forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate of the base<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and no other 
evidence was presented regarding the final disposition of the case. Applicant claims the charges were dropped. Applicant and his first wife were divorced in 
August 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, Applicant married an Australian woman and remained married until 2001. They lived in the United States. She remained in this country after they 
divorced and is seeking United States citizenship. While married to his second wife, and while separated (but still living together) and shortly before he filed for 
divorce, Applicant became acquainted with a Russian woman through an adult website. She is a Russian citizen and resident. Applicant developed a 
relationship over the internet with her and went to Russia to visit her 1-7 October, 2001. Although aware that their marriage was ending, Applicant's second 
wife was upset and confused. Shortly after his return from Russia, on October 18, 2001, Applicant filed for divorce from his second wife. Applicant believed 
there was a possibility that his relationship with the Russian woman might lead to marriage. Their relationship consisted of email correspondence, two or three 
phone calls, and his visit. The relationship last approximately three months. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 29, 2001, Applicant's wife filed an "adult abuse, ex parte order of protection."<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> In the order she swore that Applicant had threatened her life and 
pushed her, and she was afraid for her life.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> At the hearing, Applicant's second wife testified that she had lied about the information contained in this order and 
filed for the order because she was advised and believed that this would allow her to remain in their marital dwelling. She claimed that she was afraid to be out 
on her own and support herself and thought this would ensure she had a place to stay. She also claimed she did not understand the serious ramifications of this 
order. Applicant and his second wife were divorced in December 2001. They have remained friends.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March-April 2002, Applicant traveled to the Ukraine to meet a woman he met on the Internet. This woman became Applicant's third wife in August 2002. 
She is a Ukrainian citizen and lives in the United States with Applicant. Applicant's father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law are all Ukrainian citizens 
and reside in the Ukraine. His father-in-law completed compulsory military service with the then Soviet Union military and is now employed as a 
builder/construction worker. He does not work for the government. Applicant's mother-in-law is a seamstress and his sister-in-law is a 17-year-old student. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife contacts her parents and sister by telephone one or two times a week. She corresponds with them by email one or two times a month and has 
visited them annually in the Ukraine three times  since 2002. Applicant and his wife send her family birthday and holiday gifts. Applicant and his wife have sent 
money to his in-laws three or four times in 2004, some of which was used to help pay medical expenses. Applicant and his wife are planning on visiting her 
parents and sister sometime in the fall of 2005 in the Ukraine. He also would love for them to come visit them in the United States, but obtaining a visa is very 
difficult. Applicant's wife currently works at a drugstore. She hopes to further her education and eventually become a United States citizen. Applicant's wife 
admits she misses her family in the Ukraine.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided numerous character statements and witnesses that testified as to his character. Applicant is considered to be a loyal and trustworthy citizen. 
He is also considered truthful, dependable, and hardworking. He is considered to be conscientious, honest, reliable and responsible. He is not considered a 
violent person or one who would be involved in criminal activities. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline B, pertaining to foreign influence, and Guideline J, criminal conduct considerations, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. 
Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, 
the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once 
the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-27111.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons 
to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interest in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline B 
and Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country),</EM>applies. Applicant's wife is a Ukranian citizen. The 
members of her whole family are residents and citizens of the Ukraine. Applicant's wife stays in very close contact with her family, talking to them by phone 
one or two times a week, corresponding by email and visiting them annually. Applicant and his wife send presents and help her family on occasion by sending 
them money. Applicant hopes they will visit them in the United States and they have plans to visit his wife's family in the fall of 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>A determination that the 
immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States), </EM>and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 (<EM>Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent), </EM>and conclude neither applies. Although 
there is no evidence that Applicant's wife's family are agents of a foreign power, there is ample evidence to support how close she is to her family and that 
Applicant maintains a friendly relationship with his in-laws. No evidence was provided as to the type of government the Ukraine is and what tactics it might use 
to obtain information from Applicant through his in-laws. However, the Ukraine was part of the former Soviet Union and Applicant's father-in-law actually 
served in its military. In today's world of information gathering it is common place for countries to seek information through illegal means from other countries. 
If Applicant has not established that his wife's family members in the Ukraine can not be exploited in such a way as to force Applicant to choose between 
loyalty to his wife and her family and his loyalty to the United States then the case must be resolved against him. Applicant has not provided any evidence to 
show that the family members of his wife are not a security risk under FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife is close to her family and misses them while she is living in the United States. She visits them annually, communicates with them frequently, 
and she and Applicant have plans to visit them in 2005. Applicant has provided gifts and money to his in-law. Applicant has shown a concern for his in-laws. 
The relationship Applicant and especially his wife have with her parents and her sister could be exploited by the Ukraine and is a security concern. All of these 
factors show his relationship towards his in-laws and his wife's close relationship with her family and the possibility they can be exploited by the Ukraine to 
have him compromise his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has failed to raise any factors to mitigate concerns about his wife's family members in the 
Ukraine. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B that pertain to his wife's family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's relationship with a Russian woman marginally falls within FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1. Applicant had a short term relationship with her, visited her once 
and stayed in contact for approximately three months. I find FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 applies. Applicant does not have a personal relationship or contact with her any 
longer. I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding his contact with a citizen and resident of Russia. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal misconduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged)</EM> and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>applies. Applicant was arrested in 1996 
for assault consummated by a battery. It is unclear what the final </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">disposition of the case was. He also had an ex parte order imposed on him in 2001. Both issues involved alleged incidents with his then wives. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent);</EM> CC MC E2.10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident); </EM>and<EM> </EM>CC MC E2.10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur). </EM>I conclude although there were two alleged incidents, both incidents involved women that Applicant is not 
longer involved with. I find these incidents were isolated. I also find that it has been between four and nine years since these incidents occurred and they are not 
recent and it is not likely these types of violations will recur. I find  Applicant has mitigated the concerns regarding his criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered Applicant's demeanor and credibility while testifying and considered the whole person. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns 
regarding Guideline B. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided for Applicant and Guideline B is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
