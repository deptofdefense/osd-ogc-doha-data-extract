allegations pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E, subparagraph 2.a. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. After a thorough and careful review of the record, I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a U.S. government contractor. He has worked for this contractor since March 1999 as a claims processor. He was a medical technician in the Navy from 1969 to 
1973.<A HREF="05-03305.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1969 to at least 2001. He indicated that he started drinking after he joined the Navy in 1969.</P> 
 
<P>On December 21, 1981, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. He was found guilty, and sentenced to fines and court costs of about $147.00.</P> 
 
<P>On January 13, 1984, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. He was convicted and sentenced to five days in jail.</P> 
 
<P>In 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Subsequently, he received court-ordered treatment from May 13, 1996 to June 13, 1996, in the Addictive 
Disorders Treatment Program of a hospital.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested on October 20, 2001 and charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and having an elevated blood alcohol content. He pled no contest to operating a motor vehicle 
while intoxicated and was sentenced to alcohol assessment, forfeiture/fine one-day credit ($75.00) applied to a fine and court costs, leaving a balance of $1109, jail for 10 days, and revocation of his 
driver's license for 18 months. The other charge was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>From August 2002 to March 2003, Applicant received treatment in the Addictive Disorders Treatment Program of a hospital, for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Abuse/Dependence. The diagnosis 
was made by a psychologist.<A HREF="05-03305.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant admits that his condition was diagnosed as "Irresponsible Use of Ethol &amp; Borderline Abuse." The language of either of the aforementioned diagnoses is the 
same as the other.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant denies that he continued to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his treatment in August 2002 to March 2003 for Alcohol Abuse/Dependence. He did not provide evidence to refute that he no 
longer abuses alcohol.</P> 
 
<P>A medical record progress note indicates Applicant's visited a doctor on September 4, 2003 as a follow-up assessment and recites:</P>

<P>To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation. "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that,

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information 
due to carelessness.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1969 to at least 2001, a period of more than 32 years. Moreover, in 1981, 1984, 1996, and 2001, he 
was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. From May 1996 to June 1996 he received court-ordered counseling in the Addictive Disorders Treatment Program of a hospital to deal 
with his alcohol problem. In the 2001 incident, he also had his driver's license suspended for 18 months. Subsequently, in August 2002 to March 2003, he once again received treatment in the Addictive 
Disorders Treatment Program for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Abuse/Dependence. Consequently, this establishes Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>); AC DC E2.A7.1.2.3 (<EM>diagnosis by a 
credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist)</EM>); and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5 (<EM>habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>Various conditions can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. Applicant has a long history of drinking alcohol that spans at least three decades, as he started drinking at age 19. In 1981, 1984, 
1996, and 2001, he was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The three earlier convictions could, standing alone, be considered as not recent and mitigated by time. However, they 
do indicate a pattern. The conviction in 2001 is more recent and supports a conclusion that the three prior incidents should not be negated by time because Applicant continued his pattern in 2001 of 
driving after overindulging in alcohol. Moreover, he continued to drink alcohol after his diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse/Dependence. Applicant has failed to provide evidence that he no longer continues to 
use alcohol or how long he has been alcohol-free. Thus, the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.1 (<EM>the alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>), AC MC 
E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>), AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 (<EM>positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>), and AC MC 
E2.A7.1.3.4 (<EM>following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, 
participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous of a similar organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a 
credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>) do not apply. Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case. 
Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.h of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct is always a trust concern because it asks the central question whether the person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly fulfill the fiduciary 
requirements of an ADP position.</P> 
 
<P>A medical record progress note indicates Applicant had two beers in May 2003, which occurred after his March 2003 diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse/Dependence. Although Applicant denies that he 
continued to consume alcohol after his treatment in March 2003, the record evidence does not support his contention. Therefore, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.1 (<EM>reliable, 
unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>) applies. None of the available Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions applies. Applicant 
has not mitigated the Government's case. Accordingly, allegation 2.a of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in this case. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant is a 
mature individual, who has had a problem with alcohol spanning more than 30 years. He has received court-ordered treatment for his alcohol problem at least twice. Not only was his driver's license 
revoked for 18 months based on the arrest in October 2001, he received a sentence for 10 days in jail. Under these circumstances, Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case under either the 
alcohol consumption or personal security guidelines. Accordingly, I conclude that it is not consistent with the national interest to grant a trustworthiness determination to Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>

is denied.</P>
