citizen Applicant who managed to depart the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) in 1995 with
his parents and younger brother--now all naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  His three

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Security concerns were raised regarding a 28-year-old Vietnam-born naturalized U.S. citizen
Applicant who managed to depart the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) in 1995 with his
parents and younger brother--now all naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  His three older
siblings were not permitted to accompany the family because the Orderly Departure Program denied
children 21 and older preference category eligibility from their parents' immigrant visa petitions, and
they remain citizens and residents of SRVN, with approved U.S. immigration visa status awaiting

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On October 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In a sworn written statement, dated October 29, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2004.  A notice of
hearing was issued May 12, 2004, scheduling the hearing for May 27, 2004. It was held as scheduled. 
During the hearing, one government exhibit, nine Applicant Exhibits, and the testimony of two
Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on
June 14, 2004.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	During the proceeding, Department Counsel announced the government would not present
evidence pertaining to the allegations in subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR and conceded the
allegations were mitigated.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Also, under Rule 201(b)(2), Federal Rules of Evidence, Department
Counsel requested that official notice be taken of certain adjudicative facts as set forth in a document
furnished for consideration.  There being no objection by Applicant, I took official notice of the U.S.
Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, <EM>Consular Information Sheet: Vietnam</EM>, dated
January 13, 2004, consisting of eight pages.</P>

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has admitted one of the two remaining factual allegations pertaining to foreign
influence under Guideline B (subparagraph 1.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as
findings of fact.  He denied the other factual allegation (subparagraph 1.b.).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a SECRET
security clearance.  He previously held an interim security clearance for over two years until October
2003 when it was revoked in connection with this security clearance review process.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant was born in July 1975 in what had, only months before, become known as the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN).<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He lived there with his parents and four siblings--three
brothers and one sister.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After the fall of the non-communist Republic of Vietnam (RVN),
Applicant's father (born in 1944)<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>--a former enlisted member of the Army of RVN (ARVN)<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>--was
required to attend re-indoctrination and re-education classes for one or two months.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Upon his
father's release, the family was forced to relocate to an isolated rural area of the country,<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> where there
was no clean water or electricity.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  His father was a farmer and his mother (born in 1948)<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> operated
a grocery store in the mornings and was a homemaker during the evenings.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant attended
local schools, but when he was 15-years-old, he was sent away to attend high school.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He attended
a local college for two years.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's mother's side of the family was able to flee RVN for the U.S. during the final
days of RVN in April 1975.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  One remaining member managed to immigrate to the U.S. in 1990.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>
Applicant rarely saw his father's side of the family because they resided in a town very far from his
own and there were severe travel restrictions in SRVN when Applicant was young.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  They remained
in SRVN, but Applicant has no contact with them at all.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  In the early 1990s, Applicant's maternal
grandfather sponsored Applicant, his parents, and a younger brother for entry into the U.S. under the
United Nation's Orderly Departure Program (ODP) for Vietnam citizens with relatives who had
resettled abroad.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  They were permitted to emigrate and arrived in the U.S. in 1995.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant was
20 years old at that time.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Under the ODP program, as administered by the U.S., children age 21
and older, may not derive eligibility from their parents' immigrant visa petitions in a preference
category.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  A direct result of this U.S. immigration priority policy was to divide families such as
Applicant's, for while Applicant, his parents, and his younger brother were allowed to immigrate to
the U.S., his two older brothers (born in 1971 and 1973, respectively),<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and sister (born in 1967),<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>
were not permitted to join their family.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant attended a high school in the U.S.,<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> a community college where he was awarded
an associate in science degree in engineering science (with highest honor),<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> and a major U.S.
university where, in December 2000, he was granted a bachelor of science degree in computer
engineering.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He has continued his education, and is now a candidate for a masters degree in
electrical engineering.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2001.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He renounced his Vietnamese
citizenship when he took the oath of allegiance and became a naturalized citizen of the United States
and pledged his loyalty to protect and defend the interests of the U.S.  Applicant is not a dual citizen
and considers himself to be a citizen of only the U.S.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  The government has offered no evidence to
rebut Applicant's contention, and I accept it as fact.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's father became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2001, and resides in the U.S. with his

U.S. citizen in 2002,<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> and resides in the U.S. with Applicant and their parents.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	As noted above, when Applicant departed SRVN, he left two older brothers and a sister
behind.  They are all citizens of SRVN.  Applicant's sister is a high school geometry teacher<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>
residing in SRVN with her husband--also a teacher at the same school<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>--and young daughter.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>
Applicant rarely communicates with his sister because she does not have a computer for e-mail and
regular mail is too time consuming.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  While his parents may speak with her by telephone, he very
rarely does so.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  Since Applicant departed SRVN in 1995, he has seen his sister only once, during
a visit to SRVN which he made in 2001.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  They do not exchange gifts.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> Applicant's mother

excellence award and promoted, effective May 2003.  His mentor at the company strongly supports
his application, and has characterized his performance and character in the following favorable

<P>	The government of RVN collapsed in 1975, coinciding with the establishment of the
Communist SRVN.  Full diplomatic relations were established between the U.S. and SRVN in 1995,
and, in 2001, a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries finally commenced.  Under that
agreement, <EM>temporary</EM>--later modified to <EM>conditional</EM>--normal trade relations (formerly known as
most-favored nation status) were extended by the U.S.  SRVN has also given the U.S. modest
support in the war against terrorism.  While SRVN has a Communist totalitarian government which
seemingly encourages technology transfers from the Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad, the
Department Counsel has offered no evidence to indicate SRVN conducts intelligence operations or
economic espionage against the United States.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each
guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding
whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information
(Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules

in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section
E.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair
and impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
"whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative
Process factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at
the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>	GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an
individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States
or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens
of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or
pressure.</STRONG></P>

in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_71_"><SUP> (71)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." 
For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards
are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided
drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the
government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified
information.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the
applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that
the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect
or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism
are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this
decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any
express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of witness testimony,
demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts and factors,
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set
forth in the SOR:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed
as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his immediate family or persons to
whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, two of his three brothers
and his sister, as well as other extended family members (aunt, uncle, sister-in-law, brother-in-law,
and niece) are citizens and residents of SRVN--are either not citizens or residents of the United
States or may be subject to duress.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion,
exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise
of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign
country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_72_"><SUP> (72)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>		The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the
Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such
family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  Whether an applicant's family
ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common
sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those
family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The citizenship status of Applicant's two brothers and sister, when considered in light of the
nature of the government in SRVN--a Communist totalitarian country that is no longer involved in
open military hostilities with the U.S., whose interests are not necessarily inimical to the U.S., and
currently is engaged in normal trade relations with the U.S.--facilitates an analysis involving the
adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set forth therein.  Of Applicant's
immediate family, his parents and youngest brother are already naturalized U.S. citizens residing in
the U.S.  Of his extended family, all of his mother's relatives are already naturalized U.S. citizens
residing in the U.S., but those relatives on his father's side remain citizens and residents of SRVN.
As to those family members remaining in SRVN, the issue of potential foreign influence is raised. 
It should be remembered, however, this situation was in large measure caused by the U.S. policies
pertaining to the ODP program, where children age 21 and older, could not derive eligibility from
their parents' immigrant visa petitions in a preference category.  But for the restrictions of that
policy, Applicant's two brothers and sister would already be in the U.S.  Nevertheless, these facts
activate Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family
member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of,
or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC)
E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,
daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual
to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  Moreover, as to
Applicant's extended family members remaining in SRVN, especially those from his father's side
of the family, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. applies (<EM>contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are
casual and infrequent</EM>).  Department Counsel concurred in this analysis and has conceded the
relationships are sufficiently casual and infrequent to alleviate government concerns in this regard.<A HREF="02-26961.h1.html#N_73_"><SUP> (73)</SUP></A>
After an examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's two older brothers and sister,
considering their citizenship, residency, and visa status, as well as their respective occupations, do
not constitute an unacceptable security risk.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation,
successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline B.
Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</P>
