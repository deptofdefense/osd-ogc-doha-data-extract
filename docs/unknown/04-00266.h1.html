<P>Applicant's personal conduct and financial problems continue to raise security concerns over his failure to resolve his debts to a number of creditors and 
because he gave false answers on a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Standard Form (SF) 85 P.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">stating </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive 
position requiring ADP clearance.<A HREF="03-03661.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Security concerns were raised under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 9, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On December 1, 2004, I was assigned the case. On January 6, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing to be held on January 28, 2005.  For good cause, that hearing was rescheduled.  On May 2, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing to be held on May 20, 2005.  On June 9, 2005, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR was amended, over objections of Applicant's counsel, to add: "2.d. You were arrested on or about July 2003, in [town, state] and charged with 
driving while intoxicated." Applicant's counsel objected as to relevance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits owing four debts and admits being arrested three times. He denies two debts and denies he falsified his SF 85 P. 
These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 29 year old network systems administrator who has worked for a defense contractor since November 1998, and is seeking a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant indicated a department store debt (SOR 1.a, $1,611) had been settled, but he did not provide supporting documentation because it had been settled 
between seven and nine years before the hearing. (Tr. 24) Applicant's July 2003 credit report (Gov Ex 3) indicates as of June 2003, the account had been 
charged off and transferred to another creditor.  Applicant said his wife (Tr. 24) had paid a gasoline credit card debt (SOR 1.c, $156).  Upon questioning at the 
hearing, he stated his mother (Tr. 32) had paid the debt. The debt appears on his July 2003 credit report.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant states he paid his telephone bill (SOR 1.e, $198).  He says he canceled his service and submitted his last payment.  Thereafter he received another 
bill from the company.  He returned that bill to the company and disputed he owed the debt. (Tr. 25) His July 2003 credit report lists a May 1999 charge off. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He admits owing a department store debt (SOR 1.b, $440), a telephone bill (SOR 1.d, $242) and a collection agency debt (SOR 1.f, $2,931).  Two debts are 
listed on his July 2003 credit report, and the other debt listed on his June 2004 credit report (Gov Ex 4).  The finance company debt lists a balance date of July 
2002, and the telephone bill has a March 2003 balance date.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The state has a four year statute of limitation on debt collection.  Applicant asserts all the debts listed in the SOR are unenforceable. (Tr. 26) Applicant recently 
bought a new car and the week prior to the hearing refinanced his home.  He had no difficulty with either transaction.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR lists six debts totaling approximately $5,500. A summary of those debts follows:</SPAN></P>

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  He had attended a party at his girlfriend's house and fell asleep 
when he was driving to his parent's home after the party. His car jumped the curb and hit a fence. Applicant failed a breathalyzer test. He pleaded nolo 
contendere and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, community service, four mandatory DWI educational classes, and to pay a fine and court costs of $932. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with reckless driving. When Applicant swerved to miss an accident, the police at the scene thought 
Applicant was driving recklessly. (Tr. 37)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The charge was later dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault. Applicant and his wife were involved in an argument. They had only been married a couple of 
months, having been married in November 1999, and were having marital difficulties. His wife threw a small radio at him and when he threw it back, it hit her 
in the face.  He was arrested and held in jail for 17 hours.  When the couple reconciled, the charges were dropped. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2003, when Applicant completed his SF 85P, he failed to list his DWI or assault charge because he did not want his boss or coworkers to see them. 
Question 20 asked if, during the prior seven years, Applicant had been arrested, charged with, or convicted of any offenses. He answered "No" to the question 
failing to list any of his three arrests. He stated he thought the question only related to convictions.  Additionally, he thought his February 1997 DWI arrest had 
occurred more than seven years before he completed the form when, in fact, it had occurred six and a half years prior to completing the form. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 22 asked him if he was now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation.  He answered "No" failing to list any of his debts because 
the debts were old and he was not being contacted by creditors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant answered "No" when asked if he had "any involvement" with the police since his 2000 arrest. (Tr. 39) Upon further questioning, 
Applicant admitted to being pulled over for traffic violations which were clarified to mean speeding tickets. Upon further questioning, Applicant admitted 
being arrested in July 2003 for DWI. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case. Additionally, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-00266.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information to be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under 
agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties 
is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his 
finances so as to meet his financial obligations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has six unpaid debts totaling approximately $5,500. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) 
and 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts three of the bills have been paid, but has provided no documentation supporting his assertion. He indicates he does not have any paperwork 
because they were paid so long ago.  However, the debts appear on his July 2003 and June 2004 credit reports. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts all six debts are unenforceable due to the statute of limitation.  Applicant has failed to establish the last action on all of the debts occurred 
prior to four years ago in order to make the statute of limitation applicable. Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), an Administrative Judge is not 
precluded from considering the security significance of an Applicant's delinquent as merely because those debts are barred by a statute of limitations.  See, 
e.g., ISCR case number 01-09691 (March 27, 2003) at page three ("[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state law, the federal government 
is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant's conduct in incurring in failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.").  
Unenforceable debts can be considered as to the facts and circumstances under which the debts were incurred and decide whether the applicant took reasonable 
steps to address or otherwise resolve those debts before the statute of limitations expired. Accordingly, even if applicant cannot be forced by the state to pay the 
debts because of the statute of limitations, that does not preclude the Judge from considering the security implications of Applicant's failure to pay or otherwise 
resolve the debts before the statute of limitations expired.  ISCR case number 01 -06776 (July 24, 2003). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in the Applicant's favor.  MC 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The behavior was not recent.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not apply because the conduct 
is recent since the debts remain unpaid.  MC 2 (E2.A6.1.2.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>  It was an isolated incident.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not apply because there are six debts. There was no showing the 
debts were caused by factors beyond Applicant's control.  Therefore, MC 3 (E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>) does not apply.  There has 
been no showing Applicant has received financial counseling nor is there any indication his financial difficulties are under control.  Therefore, MC4  
(E2.A6.1.3.4. <EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control</EM>) does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For MC 6 (E2.A6.1.2.6. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) to apply there must be an "ability" 
to repay the debts, the "desire" to repay, and evidence of a good faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is needed, which is 
not present here. Because he has failed to document payment of his debts, I find against Applicant as to Guideline F (Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Criminal Conduct, Guideline J. Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Between February 1997 and July 2003, Applicant was arrested four times.  He was found guilty of the 1997 DWI. Because of these incidents, 
DC 1 (E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and 2. (E2.A10.1.2.2. <EM>A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although arrested four times, Applicant was convicted only of the 1997 DWI.  Even though the charges were dropped, Applicant did assault his wife in March 
2000.  Applicant admitted he hit his wife in the face with a radio. He was again arrested for DWI in July 2003, but the outcome of that charge is unknown.  
Since the sole conviction occurred in 1997--more than eight years ago, I find the criminal conduct was not recent and MC 1 (E2.A10.1.3.1. <EM>The criminal 
behavior was not recent</EM>) applies.  Even the assault occurred more than five years ago.  I find for Applicant as to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's 
security. The nature of Applicant's actions, in providing false information to multiple questions on his SF 85P, poses a serious potential risk to the nation's 
security precautions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or 
oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern.  Applicant admits he did not put 
down his arrests because he did not want his boss or coworkers to see his answers.  He asserts he though questions 20, which asked if he had been arrested in 
the seven years before completing the form, was only related to convictions. Even if that were so, he should have listed his 1997 DWI conviction.  He did not 
list his delinquent debts because they were old and his creditors were not contacting him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's candor is problematic.  He was specifically asked if he had "any involvement with the police" since his March 2000 arrest.  He said "No."  That 
was a lie.  He had been arrested in July 2003 for DWI.  Applicant's explanation for failing to list his arrests and delinquent accounts on his SF 85 P lacks 
veracity. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the mitigating conditions apply to his false answers.  His arrests and delinquent debts were pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, 
or reliability. The falsifications were not an isolated incident because he gave false answers to two different questions. There is no showing the Applicant made 
a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. There is no indication his omissions were caused by improper or 
inadequate advice from authorized personnel or based on advice from legal counsel.  Because of the serious nature of his falsifications, I find against the 
Applicant as to Personal Conduct, SOR subparagraph 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
