<P>Applicant has over $17,000 in debts that are delinquent, charged-off, or in collection status. She failed to contact most of the debtors and has not paid most of 
them any money. It is not likely that she will be able to resolve these debts in the next year. Applicant deliberately falsified her security clearance application by 
failing to note her delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 24 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-26015.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant received the SOR on 4 February 2005, and filed a written Answer on 19 February 2005, in which she elected to 
have her case decided on the record without a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 24 March 2005. That same day, Applicant sent the Department Counsel 
originally assigned to the case a facsimile requesting a hearing. The Department Counsel told Applicant she would get a hearing before an administrative judge. 
On 19 April 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 28 April 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"To be entitled to a hearing, the applicant must specifically request a hearing in his or her answer. The answer must be received by the DOHA within 20 days 
from receipt of the SOR.  Requests for an extension of time to file an answer may be submitted to the Director, DOHA, or designee, who in turn may grant the 
extension only upon a showing of good cause."  Directive &para; E3.1.4.  In this case, Applicant answered within 20 days of her receipt of the SOR and did not 
specifically request a hearing.</P> 
<P>The Directive does not provide authority to grant a hearing to an Applicant who has not requested one in her answer. She may request an extension of time to 
file the answer, but only the Director, DOHA, or his designee may grant an extension and only upon a showing of good cause. Applicant never requested an 
extension of time to file her answer-she in fact timely filed her answer-and there has been no showing the Director, DOHA, or his designee found good cause 
to grant a request for an extension. Applicant was not entitled to a hearing. Nevertheless, as the issue was not brought to my attention until shortly before the 
hearing and Applicant had relied on the original Department Counsel's representations that she could still have a hearing, I conducted the hearing and have 
rendered a decision.<A HREF="03-26015.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old packer for a defense contractor. Tr. 17-18. She held a security clearance for two years between 1984 and 1986. She was married to 
her first husband from 1970-80. She married her second husband in 1994, but separated from him in January 2004. She has since filed for a divorce that should 
have become final on 19 May 2005. She has three grown children. None of the children live with her, but she still helps her son financially.</P> 
<P>In 1986, while she was between marriages, Applicant had debts discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Tr. 38-39. Since that discharge, she and her second 
husband accumulated over $17,000 in debt.  A summary of those debts and their current status is displayed in the chart below:</P>

<P>Applicant's take-home pay is approximately $1,300 a month. She estimates she has $150 remaining each month after paying her current bills. After she 
completes paying off the educational loan in 2005 via garnishment of her pay, she will have an additional $140 each month with which to pay her debts. </P> 
<P>On 5 February 2003, Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA).  Question 38 ask if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been 
delinquent on any debt more than 180 days. Question 39 asked if Applicant was then delinquent more than 90 days on any debt. Applicant answered no to both 
questions.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F--Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has three delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.b, 1.d, 1.j), six accounts that are in collection status (&para;&para; 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i), and one 
debt that was charged off (&para; 1.c) totaling more than $17,000. In her Answer, Applicant basically admitted all of the debts,<A HREF="03-26015.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> some with explanation. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate fund's. Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a history 
of not meeting her financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy those debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3). Although she made some progress 
in paying off her educational loan via a voluntary allotment, it is now being satisfied through court ordered garnishment. Applicant does not know what one of 
her debts is for and believes it may be for medical care she thought was being covered by her medical insurance. But she did not contact the creditor to find out 
if that was the case. She also failed to contact most the creditors to try to establish payment plans. Applicant insists that some of her financial problems are the 
result of her husband who is a drug addict and has not worked in a year. She left her husband in January 2004 and initiated divorce proceedings that should be 
finalized in May 2005. While this may limit her future debt, it does not resolve the many debts she has that are delinquent. Applicant failed to mitigate the 
financial security concerns raised in the SOR. She has not shown that she is in control of her financial situation. Even after she completes payments on her 
educational loan, the additional $140 in her account will do little to resolve her debts in the next year or two.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on her SCA by failing to disclose that, in the previous seven years, she had debts that were over 
180 days delinquent (&para; 2.a) and debts that were then currently delinquent (&para; 2.b). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant denied the allegations. Conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly 
safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established Applicant failed to accurately answer question 38 and 39 on her SCA. She claims she was unaware of the extent of her 
debts because she turned over her bills to a credit counseling service that failed to help her, and she thought her debts had been charged off, so she was not 
required to report them. After listening to her testimony and observing her demeanor, I am convinced she deliberately answered questions 38 and 39 incorrectly. 
The evidence established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An applicant who deliberately falsifies material information from an SCA 
raises a security concern. An applicant's financial situation is relevant and material to her security worthiness. None of the listed mitigating conditions apply.
