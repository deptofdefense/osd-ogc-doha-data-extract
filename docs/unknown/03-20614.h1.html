<P>Twenty-three-year old Applicant abused marijuana on approximately 100 occasions, until at least August 2003.  He continued to do so, and lied about it, after 
he was: convicted of possession of marijuana in 2001; questioned about such use in his SF 86; granted an interim security clearance; and interviewed by DIS.  
Until August 2004, his verbal commitment to marijuana was cavalier and steadfast: "I do not care if I violate the law . . . when it pertains to marijuana because I 
think marijuana should be legalized."  His refusal to discontinue his association with drug users and drug dealers was unshakeable.  His recent vow to avoid 
marijuana in the future, when compared to his earlier actions and statements leaves grave doubts as to his security eligibility.  Furthermore, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 
disqualifies him from eligibility for a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn, written answer, notarized May 27, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me 
on August 2, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, and the hearing was held before me on August 17, 2004.  During the hearing, three 
government exhibits and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant) were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 25, 2004.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted five of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline H (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f.), as well 
as both factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  He denied the remaining factual allegations (subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.g.).</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a SECRET security clearance.  He had previously been granted a clearance 
on an interim basis, but that clearance expired after one year.</P> 
<P>Applicant is a substance abuser whose illegal substance of choice is marijuana.  He started using marijuana while attending a community college in 1999,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> when 
he was about 18 years old, and continued using it, with varying frequency, until at least August 2003.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has used marijuana on approximately 100 occasions, 
and the hashish form on one occasion.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  His marijuana abuse occurred with no set pattern, but generally took place when he was around friends<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>--many of 
whom smoke marijuana and a few of whom deal marijuana<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>--because it makes him feel euphoric,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and he feels peer pressure from his friends to do so.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In February 2001, Applicant was arrested by campus police and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana over 2.5 grams.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  
Upon his plea, he was convicted of the charge of possession of marijuana--the other charge was dismissed--and he was fined $200.00 and placed on 12 
months court supervision.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He was also ordered by the university to seek drug abuse treatment at the university wellness center.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In March 2003, while applying for a position with the government contractor that eventually hired him, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application 
(SF 86),<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and in response to a drug-related inquiry: (<EM>Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled 
substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants 
(barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?</EM>),<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant responded "yes," and indicated he had 
used marijuana on five occasions between November 2000 and February 2001.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He certified his response was true, complete, and accurate, but it was false, for 
Applicant minimized the period of his substance abuse, minimized the frequency of such abuse, and omitted the hashish use.</P> 
<P>During a June 2003 interview with an agent of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS), Applicant opened up a bit and revised his substance abuse history.  He 
acknowledged using marijuana in 1999,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> admitted using it on 35 occasions, rather than just 5,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and admitted purchasing marijuana on at least 3 occasions.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  
He denied ever using any other substance (such as hashish).<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Applicant acknowledged he had lied on his SF 86 because he "thought it might affect [his] 
chances of getting a clearance."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  He vowed he would not use marijuana again in the future,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> and promised to "be honest on all future security forms."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  His 
comments were reduced to a written statement, and he swore under oath his statement was correct and true as written.  Notwithstanding his oath, the statements, 
vows, and promises appearing in his written statement eventually proved to be false.</P> 
<P>In August 2003, Applicant was again interviewed.  He admitted he lied on his SF 86,<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and acknowledged when he completed his written statement the previous 
June, he knowingly, willfully and deliberately lied to the agent who had interviewed him.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He lied about his drug abuse because he "was afraid that [he] would 
be prosecuted, that [he] would not get [his] clearance, [and] [he] would lose [his] job."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Moreover, he was still using drugs.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  Applicant knew his written 
statement of June 2003 was a lie, but feared the truth would cost him his job and result in his prosecution and possible imprisonment.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not care 
because he believed he could keep the information from both his employer and the government.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  In fact, it was Applicant's desire to keep his drug abuse from 
his employer even after he opened up to the government.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant was hired by his employer in June 2003, but continued using marijuana after he was hired and continued to do so--even after receiving an interim 
SECRET clearance--until one week before making his August 2003 statement.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  That sworn statement contains several significant admissions and 
acknowledgments regarding Applicant's motivation for abusing marijuana.  They are:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>"I am sure today that I will most likely continue to smoke marijuana."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></LI> 
</UL> 
<UL> 
  <LI>"I will smoke marijuana in the future."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></LI>

<UL> 
  <LI>"I do not care if I violate the law of states and the federal government when it pertains to marijuana because I think marijuana should be legalized."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></LI> 
</UL>
<P>In his May 2004 Response to SOR, Applicant added some comments pertaining to his substance abuse that provides additional information as to his motivation.  
They are:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>". . .full disclosure of such information [on the SF 86 and in the June 2003 statement] would criminally incriminate me and unjustly prevent me from 
obtaining a security clearance."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></LI> 
</UL>
<P>During the hearing, Applicant again refined his drug-related comments.  They are:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>"I could not say that never ever again in my life would I never smoke marijuana."<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></LI> 
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has experienced periods of depression, lasting a couple of months at a time.  He has also had moments in his life when he wanted to kill himself.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  A 
psychiatrist prescribed him Prozac and Depakote to treat his conditions, but after awhile, Applicant stopped seeing the psychiatrist and ceased taking his 
medication.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by his current employer, a government contractor, since June 2003, and presently serves as an embedded software engineer.<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to both adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."  The waiver authority does not apply to current 
substance abuse or mental incompetence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates that provision 2, described above, "does not change the substance of the existing adjudication 
guidelines relative to current drug involvement.  Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance is not considered eligible 
for a security clearance."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved and adopted, amending 
portions of Subsection (c)(1) of section 986 of Title 10, United States Code.  Those changes had no bearing on the drug-related allegations in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-20614.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline H.  Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, consisting of the purchase, possession, and use of 
marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The Directive clearly expresses the government's concern 
regarding drug involvement in provision E2.A8.1.1.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or 
ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information</EM>).  Drug abuse is defined in provision E2.A8.1.1.3.: (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates 
from approved medical direction</EM>).  Provision E2.A8.1.1.2.1. generally identifies and defines drugs: (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified 
and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens</EM>)).  
Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>any 
drug abuse</EM>), and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not simply experiment, while a teenager, out of curiosity, and then quit.  Rather, he commenced using marijuana while in college, 
notwithstanding the illegal nature of his endeavor.  He exhibited a lengthy pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature behavior, and 
continued his substance abuse of marijuana over the years--even after he was arrested, charged, and convicted of marijuana possession in 2001--until at least 
August 2003.  He continued abusing marijuana after he was questioned about such use in his SF 86; after he was granted an interim security clearance; after he 
was interviewed by DIS; and up to his interview with DSS.  Until August 2004, his commitment to continued marijuana abuse was cavalier and steadfast: "I do 
not care if I violate the law of states and the federal government when it pertains to marijuana because I think marijuana should be legalized."  His refusal to 
discontinue friendship and association with drug users and drug dealers was unshakeable.  It was only after reality hit him with the realization that his security 
clearance and job were about to be lost that Applicant chose to verbalize another course, away from substance abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on his inconsistent oral and written statements and admissions, as well as the variety of lies made by him, it is probable the substance abuse has not yet 
ceased.  In light of his recently changed comments regarding future intentions, I construe Applicant's position in this regard as follows: he sees nothing wrong 
with using marijuana and, until very recently, would have every intention of continuing to do so if the opportunity presented itself.  But now, when clearly faced 
with the probable denial of a security clearance, as well as the loss of his job, he has seen the light and will abstain.  Applicant's new position, in my estimation, 
does not constitute a clear and unambiguous expressed intent to discontinue substance abuse, and therefore, does not fall within DI DC E2.A8.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>).  As stated above, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding this 
individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Applicant's past words and actions have created clear doubt over his unwillingness to 
discontinue illegal marijuana use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes are significant factors in the overall adjudicative process.  Despite a lengthy 
period of substance abuse, Applicant has adhered to the mission of NORML and ignored what he may have learned while attending a drug awareness, 
education, or treatment program.  His previous statements and actions instead raise substantial questions as to his candor and the honesty of his newly stated 
position.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's continuing drug involvement throughout the DIS and DSS investigation process, and after he was granted an interim security clearance, also falls 
within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  Until recently, he refused to state unequivocally that he would no longer use marijuana in the future and has, instead, displayed a 
somewhat cavalier attitude towards illegal substance use and the necessity of his obtaining a security clearance.  Under these circumstances, based on the law, 
as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive, Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case.  
The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.g. of the 
SOR are concluded against Applicant.  Consequently, under Guideline H and 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Examination of Applicant's actions reveals conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  There is little dispute surrounding Applicant's actions.  He admitted he 
lied on his SF 86, and acknowledged when he completed his written statement the previous June, he knowingly, willfully and deliberately lied to the agent who 
had interviewed him.  He lied about his drug abuse because he "was afraid that [he] would be prosecuted, that [he] would not get [his] clearance, [and] [he] 
would lose [his] job."  Applicant knew his written statement of June 2003 was a lie, but feared the truth would cost him his job and result in his prosecution and 
possible imprisonment.  Applicant did not care because he believed he could keep the information from both his employer and the government.  In fact, it was 
Applicant's desire to keep his drug abuse from his employer even after he furnished additional facts to the government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate, meaningful security clearance 
determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security.  The nature of 
Applicant's actions therefore pose a serious potential risk to the nation's security precautions which go to the very heart of the nation's security system.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's overall questionable personal conduct in this regard clearly falls within Personal Conduct </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant was granted his interim security clearance he entered into a fiduciary relationship with the government and implicitly promised to follow the 
laws of the land and protect the nation's secrets.  When accountability time arose, he sundered that fiduciary relationship and revealed his true allegiance--to 
drugs and protecting his own interests.  While there may be some truth to his most recent declared positions, his earlier pattern of deception controls in this 
situation.  Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case.  The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's 
continued security eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, allegations 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
