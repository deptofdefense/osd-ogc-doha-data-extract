<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 7, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated July 13, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The issue raised on appeal is whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN>  In his appeal, Applicant disagrees with the Judge's 
findings and conclusions about his financial situation.  He reiterates portions of his testimony from the hearing, arguing that he satisfied the judgments listed in 
subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of the SOR by refinancing them and that he kept the payments on the refinancing up to date.  He repeats his contentions that his 
financial problems were caused by a job lay-off and that he has made significant progress in improving his financial standing.  He states that he is financially 
responsible.  The Board interprets his appeal as raising the issue of whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, unless the Judge specifically 
states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Apart from that presumption, the Board notes that the Judge's evaluation of 
Applicant's history takes into account the testimony that Applicant cites on appeal.  The presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence is not 
rebutted by a showing that the Judge did not give certain evidence as much weight as the appealing party would have liked.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-18172 
(October 7, 2005) at p. 3.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's testimony constituted record evidence about his recent attempts to resolve his outstanding debts and the hardship that a job layoff worked on his 
finances.  The Administrative Judge had the responsibility of weighing that evidence along with other record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and 
making a reasoned decision as to whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa.  </EM>Absent a showing that the Judge weighed 
the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the Board will not disturb the Judge's weighing of the record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 02-09892 (July 15, 2004) at p. 5.  In this case, the Judge's ultimate adverse security clearance decision is reasonably supported by the record evidence, 
and Applicant has not shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.      </P>
