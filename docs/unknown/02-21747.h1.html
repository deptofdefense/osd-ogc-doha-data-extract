<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts accumulated during his years in college.  While his debts were extenuated some by his youth, his college 
commitments, and his lack of income as a student, the debts have not since been mitigated through sustained efforts to repay them before his receipt of the 
SOR.  With half of his debts still unresolved and no concrete plan in place to address them, Applicant fails to absolve himself of security risks associated with 
his still unresolved debts and delayed willingness to address them until the SOR issued.   Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 25, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 2, 2004.  Applicant filed a timely response to the FORM on March 8, 2004.  The case was assigned to me March 12, 
2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated delinquent debts, seven in all, totaling in excess of $9,000.00, despite a financial statement 
attached to propounded interrogatories of April 2003 that shows a net remainder of $130.00 and no payments on the listed debts.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations without any explanation.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 36-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While a college student, Applicant accumulated a number of consumer-related debts: seven in all totaling in excess of $9,000.00.  One of the debts (creditor 
1.a) represents a deficiency owed on a car that was repossessed and sold for less than the amount owed on the vehicle, leaving a deficiency of $4,350.00 as of 
arch 2003.  Another listed debt (creditor 1.c) represents the balance on a personal loan he took out with the lender while a college student.  The balance of the 
debts represent assorted consumer debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his graduation from college with a degree in engineering, Applicant gained professional employment with his current employer.  For the first two 
years of his employment with his defense contractor, he made no attempt to repay his delinquent creditors.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a DSS interview in May 2002, Applicant indicated he had ordered his credit report with the intention of repaying his delinquent debts as soon as possible, 
hopefully by October 2002 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).  He attached a personal financial statement to his written statement.  The financial statement listed his delinquent debts 
and no payments credited to the debts, despite a reported $546.00 net monthly remainder.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded under oath in May 2003 to propounded interrogatories from DOHA.  He acknowledged his delinquent debts, as well as his past failures to 
work out any payment arrangements with his creditors.  Applicant attributed his payment failures to his lack of income to adequately support his household, let 
alone repay his old debts (<EM>see</EM> ex. 9).  In an attached updated personal financial statement he did not list his delinquent debts among the debts he committed to 
making monthly payments on.  He listed a net monthly remainder of just $130.00 in this updated statement.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since receiving the SOR, Applicant has worked out payment arrangements with some of the creditors holding his delinquent debts.  Among his repayment 
efforts he documents a settled payment of $2,000.00 with creditor 1.a.  On two of his listed debts (creditors 1.e and 1.f) he claims each is one and the same with 
the other and documents payment of $175.00 in full satisfaction of the combined debt (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  Payment of this debt is accepted as Applicant's payment of 
the two debts identified in subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f of the SOR.   Applicant also documents payment of his disputed debt with creditor 1.g by a check of 
November 7, 2003 for $69.00 (<EM>see </EM>response to the FORM).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As for the balance of his listed debts, Applicant claims several failed attempts at resolving his debts with creditors 1.b and 1.c, and documents their removal 
from his latest credit report.  The remaining creditor (creditor 1.d) he assures he has contacted and is currently waiting word of a creditor response that provides 
him the most current information pertaining to the debt and the balance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on Applicant's FORM response, he has paid or settled four of his eight listed delinquent debts and in doing so has reduced his debt balance to less than 
one-half of the original delinquent debt accumulation.  He remains intent on letting two of the debts (totaling in excess of $4,200.00) remain charge offs, while 
he continues to seek more information and creditor willingness to settle his last unresolved account (creditor 1.d).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accumulated a number of debts during college.  Despite his obtaining post-graduation employment with his current defense contractor with the 
expressed intention of taking care of his old debts he has failed to do so until after the SOR issued.  Content with most of his debts being charged off and no 
longer reported in his credit report, he has failed to pursue them. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While there have been some extenuating circumstances in Applicant's youth that limited his ability to address his debts in the past, he fails to provide any 
documentation as to why he couldn't have undertaken more concerted efforts to repay his old debts than he has to date.  Several of these old debts were quite 
small and seemingly could have been paid much earlier from the income he derived from his many years of gainful employment.  Others might have required 
repayment plans.  Applicant, though, chose to simply ignore the creditors when none of them  pursued him.</SPAN>  On the strength of the evidence presented, 
Government may invoke two Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial 
obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, Applicant has initiated recent efforts to settle his debts.  Two of his small debts (creditors 1.e and 1.f) represented a single creditor and were paid 
with Applicant's November 2003 check for $175.  Applicant documents payments as well to creditor 1.g (for $69.00) and creditor 1.a by a check for $2,000 in 
settlement of the account.  Settlement prospects remain either closed or uncertain, though, with his remaining creditors (<EM>i.e., </EM>creditors 1.b through 1.d, 
representing debts in excess of $4,000.00). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Our Appeal Board has </SPAN>shown general consistency in disallowing undocumented general applicant intention to repay old debts at some uncertain future date 
when resources become available.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-17474 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-13653 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-12147 
(January 21, 2003).   Security clearance decisions are, of course, never an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about a person's security 
eligibility based on his past actions.  Without any payment documentation of repayment efforts with half of his old creditors, Applicant lacks the probative 
demonstration required to mitigate the pressure and judgment risks associated with his being in debt   <EM>See Department of Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 
(1988).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, while Applicant is credited with paying several of his debts (including two which represent the same creditor) and is to be encouraged in his efforts to 
identify and address one of his unpaid larger creditors (<EM>viz., </EM>creditor 1.d), his efforts are insufficient to mitigate security concerns associated with his 
considerable accumulation of delinquent debts over many years of inaction in dealing with them.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the 
allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d and 1.h.  Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts covered by subparagraph 1.a and subparagraphs 
1.e through 1.g.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E. 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>

factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P>
