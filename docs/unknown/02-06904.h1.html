<P>The Applicant's retired parents are citizens of and reside in Germany.  The Applicant's brother is also a German citizen and resides in Germany.  He is a 
graphics designer.  Her mother-in-law is deceased, but her 92 year old father-in-law is a citizen of and resides in Greece.  Her Greek brother-in-law is a retired 
engineer, her Greek sister-in-law is a book editor.  Finally, her Greek niece is only 15 years of age.  There is no evidence that any of the Applicant's foreign 
relatives are connected with any country's government, or are in a position to be exploited by any country.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 11, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on March 19, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 31, 2003, and the case was heard on April 17, 2003.  
The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant.  The transcript was received on May 2, 2003.  The issues raised 
here are whether the Applicant's perceived foreign influence militates against the granting of a security clearance. [Except as it refers to her deceased mother-in-law, the Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is 44 years of age</SPAN>, has a 
Ph.D. in Physics and Chemistry from an American university, and is employed by a contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant emigrated from Germany to the U.S. on 1980 (Transcript (TR) at page 17 lines 8~18).  She married an American of Greek descent in 1983 (TR 
at page 18 lines 12~17).  She attended an American university from 1983~1988, where she was awarded a Ph.D. in 1988 (TR at page 19 lines 1~8).  She also 
became a U.S. citizen in 1988 (TR at page 19 lines 21~23).</P> 
 
<P>1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant's parents are both retired (TR at page 15 lines 15~25).  Her mother is 65 and her father is 70, and both are citizens of and reside in 
Germany (<EM>id</EM>, <EM>see also</EM> Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at pages 2~3).  Her mother was a seamstress, and her father was a machinist (TR at page 15 lines 17~18).  
They have no connection with the German government (TR at page 17 lines 3~7, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) F).  The Applicant's brother is a graphics 
designer (TR at page 15 lines 18~20).  He also has no connection with the German government (AppX G).</P> 
 
<P>1.c.~1.f.  The Applicant's mother-in-law is deceased (TR at page 26 lines 16~17).  Her Greek father-in-law is 92 years of age, and is a retired bank president 
(TR at page 26 line 18 to page 27 line 2).  He resides in Greece, but has no connection with the Greek government (<EM>id</EM>, AppX's E).  Her brother-in-law and 
sister-in-law also reside in and are citizens of Greece (TR at page 24 line 21 to page 25 line 8).  Her brother-in-law is a retired engineer, and her sister-in-law is 
a book editor (TR at page 27 lines 3~17).  Neither of these in-laws have any connection with the Greek government (AppX E).  Finally, the Applicant's Greek 
niece is only 15 years of age, and obviously has no connection with the Greek government (TR at page 27 lines 18~24).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's program director, current and prior supervisors, and security advisor all think highly of the Applicant (AppX A~D).  They all know of her 
foreign connections through her birth and her marriage, and would recommend her for a position of trust (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's retired parents are citizens of and reside in Germany.  Her German brother also resides in Germany.  Neither her parents nor her brother have 
any connection with any government, and there is no evidence that her parent's and brother's presence in Germany can be exploited by any government.  As to 
her Greek relatives through marriage, her 92 year old father-in-law, 15 year old niece, and brother and sister-in-law have no connection with he Greek 
government, nor is there any evidence that their presence in Greece can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that 
the Applicant would even countenance any such attempt at exploitation of any of her German or Greek relatives.  Guideline B is thus found in the Applicant's 
favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
