<P>Applicant used heroin and cocaine when stationed in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971. After his discharge from the military, he continued to use illicit drugs, and 
was arrested in about July 1973 on controlled dangerous substance charges. Sentenced to five to six years incarceration (suspended) for possession of marijuana 
with intent to sell, Applicant is statutorily disqualified from being granted a security clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, despite his abstinence from illegal drugs 
since 1973 and productive employment as a heavy equipment mechanic with a defense contractor since 1978. Clearance is denied with a recommendation this 
case be considered for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-15508.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on Criminal Conduct (Guideline J).</P> 
 
<P>On September 16, 2003, Applicant executed an Answer to the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me 
on March 22, 2004. Pursuant to formal notice of that same date, a hearing was held as scheduled on April 13, 2004. The Government submitted two exhibits 
that were entered in the record. Applicant and four witnesses testified on Applicant's behalf, as reflected in a transcript received on April 26, 2004. Applicant 
also presented 11 exhibits that were admitted without objection.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) concerns due to Applicant's arrest in June 1973 for possession of hallucinogenic substance, for which he was 
sentenced to one year in jail, suspended and two years probation; possession of marijuana, which was nolle prossed; and possession of marijuana with intent to 
sell, for which he was sentenced to a prison term of five to six years (suspended). Since he was sentenced to a term of incarceration of more than one year 
(albeit suspended), Applicant was alleged to be disqualified from having a clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (commonly referred to as the 
"Smith Amendment").<A HREF="03-15508.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> Applicant admits his arrest and disposition of charges as alleged. Those admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old heavy equipment mechanic who was employed by the same defense contractor (company A) from 1978 to October 2003 when his 
clearance was revoked due to the issuance of the SOR. He is subject to recall should he be granted his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>While still a teenager, Applicant was drafted into the United States military in July 1969 and sent to Vietnam. As a young private, he witnessed "devastating 
things."  As a means of coping with the stress of war, he began to use heroin and cocaine with other servicemen in Vietnam. </P> 
 
<P>On return from Vietnam, he was given an honorable discharge in July 1971. Unemployed for about 12 to 18 months and struggling to get his life in order, 
Applicant continued to use illegal drugs,  even after he began working as a chemical operator in 1972 for a local municipality. He purchased drugs from street 
dealers, and sold illegal drugs to his friends.</P> 
 
<P>In about July 1973, the local police executed a search pursuant to warrant of Applicant's residence and discovered some marijuana and mescaline. Applicant 
was arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to sell, possession of controlled drugs with intent to sell, possession of marijuana, and possession of 
controlled drugs (hallucinogens). Pursuant to a plea bargain, he was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to sell, for which he was sentenced to a 
term of incarceration of five to six years (suspended), and of possession of controlled drugs (hallucinogens) for which he was sentenced to one year in jail 
(suspended) and two years probation. The remaining charges were nolle prossed. Applicant served his probationary term without incident. His arrest served as a 
wake-up call, and Applicant stopped all involvement with illegal drugs.</P> 
 
<P>After working for two years managing a farm from 1976 to 1978, Applicant applied for work at company A. On his job application executed on July 3, 1978, 
Applicant listed a conviction in  approximately in 1972 for possession of marijuana for which he served two years probation. Hired, he was credited with a start 
date of January 1978 because he had worked as a painter for the company in 1968/69 before he was drafted. Applicant was given a company-granted 
confidential security clearance for his duties as a heavy equipment (crane) mechanic, which he held until October 2003. Subject to several random drug tests 
over the years in his job because of his commercial operator's license, Applicant has not tested positive for any illegal substance.</P> 
 
<P> Applicant proved to be a dedicated worker for the defense contractor. After Applicant broke his shoulder and elbow on the job in 1996, he was out of the yard 
for three years as he rehabilitated and the company pursued various retraining options with him. Desirous of returning to his old shop, Applicant was placed in 
the power house as he finished his recuperation in 1999. While serving in the power house, Applicant applied for a security clearance upgrade. His felony 
conviction for sale and possession of marijuana was listed on his security clearance application completed in April 2000.</P> 
 
<P>At Applicant's request, he was allowed back into his old job. Several individuals who worked with him, some more than 20 years, attest to his professionalism, 
positive attitude and work ethic, reliability, and ability to follow security guidelines. In the opinion of those persons who have had the opportunity to observe 
Applicant's job performance over many years, his knowledge and experience make him an asset to the company.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for 
a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</P> 
 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to Guideline J:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested in about July 1973 on serious illegal drug charges after the police found marijuana and mescaline in his residence. Pursuant to a plea 
bargain, Applicant was convicted of two drug charges: possession of marijuana with intent to sell, for which he was sentenced to a prison term of five to six 
years (suspended), and possession of a controlled dangerous substance (hallucinogens), for which he was sentenced to one year in jail (suspended), and two 
years probation. Notwithstanding the passage of more than 30 years since the crimes, disqualifying conditions a. (allegations or admissions of criminal 
conduct), b. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and c. (conviction in a state court and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year) 
must be considered in evaluating Applicant's current security suitability.</P> 
 
<P>Several of the Directive's mitigating conditions (MC) apply to Applicant's criminal conduct: a. (the criminal behavior was not recent); d. (the factors leading to 
the violation are not likely to recur); and f. (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation). Applicant's involvement with illicit drugs started when he was a 
young private in Vietnam. With the "devastating things" he saw in Vietnam and his unemployment and lack of direction on his return, his illegal drug 
involvement continued. While there is little detail about his past drug use of record, he admits to having used drugs, purchased them from street dealers, and 
sold at least marijuana to his friends. As testified to by a state police sergeant who has known Applicant for 26 or 27 years, Applicant turned his life in a 
positive direction after his arrest in 1973. In addition to maintaining a drug-free lifestyle, Applicant  held stable employment--since 1978 with the defense 
contractor--until October 2003 when he was terminated subject to recall following the issuance of the SOR. Individuals of long acquaintance who have either 
worked with Applicant or known him socially attest to his good character, dedication, reliability, and trustworthiness. There is no indication of recent or 
recurring questionable judgment or irresponsibility on Applicant's part which would give rise to a present security risk.</P> 
 
<P>Yet, criminal conduct punished by imposition of a prison term in excess of one year is regarded as sufficiently serious to where it cannot be mitigated unless 
meritorious circumstances exist (<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> MC g.). Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting or renewing access to 
classified information to a defense contractor employee who has been convicted in a Federal or State court and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 
one year.  Although Applicant served no jail time, he was sentenced to a term of incarceration (suspended) of five to six years. By virtue of this sentence, 
Applicant falls within the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  Hence, Applicant's request for continued access must be denied and an adverse finding returned as to 
subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR. This statutory prohibition may be waived in meritorious circumstances as determined by the Secretary of Defense.  I recommend 
further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>

<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
