<P>Applicant continues to drink beer in quantity of up to four or five beers per sitting after being diagnosed as alcohol dependent and advised to abstain from 
alcohol. He violated his probation for a 1995 criminal assault by failing to attend court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). While he was arrested three times 
for criminal assault and battery, most recently in November 2002, the incidents were aberrational and are not likely to be repeated. Applicant has $6,034 in 
outstanding bad debt that he cannot pay at present, but the debt was incurred because of an unexpected loss of income. Financial considerations and criminal 
conduct concerns have been mitigated, but personal conduct and alcohol consumption concerns persist. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On January 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-26209.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on criminal conduct (Guideline J), excessive alcohol consumption (Guideline G), 
financial considerations (Guideline F), and personal conduct (Guideline E).</P> 
 
<P>On February 3, 2003, Applicant filed an answer to the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 
16, 2003, and a formal notice was issued on June 30, 2003, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2003. At the hearing held as scheduled, nine Government 
exhibits were entered into the record and testimony was taken from the Applicant, as reflected in a transcript received by DOHA July 24, 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>DOHA alleged in the SOR criminal conduct concerns because of assault and battery incidents in 1975, 1995, and 2002; excessive alcohol consumption with 
continued drinking after a diagnosis of alcohol dependence; financial considerations due to aggregate bad debt of $6,034; and personal conduct concerns 
generated by Applicant's violation of probation after the 1995 assault and battery and by his continued drinking of four to five beers daily as of November 2002. 
Applicant admitted the arrests and failure to comply initially with the terms of his probation for the 1995 assault, but he  denied committing assault on his 
former girlfriend in 1995 or on his current girlfriend's brother in 2002. He admitted undergoing voluntary treatment for alcohol and cocaine dependence in May 
1995, and to continuing to drink beer, although not on a daily basis. Applicant did not dispute the outstanding indebtedness alleged. After a thorough review of 
the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old maintenance machinist who has worked for the same defense contractor since September 1983 with the exception of one year when 
he was terminated for failure to timely notify the company of his absence due to medical reasons. Reinstated to the job with seniority intact but without pay for 
that year, Applicant continued to work without a security clearance. He now requires a confidential clearance for his duties.</P> 
 
<P>At age 17, Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct after drinking alcohol at a big party.  He scuffled with the police officer when being placed in his jail 
cell, and a charge of assault and battery was added. The charges were continued without a finding for six months. Circa October 1975, the case was dismissed 
with payment of court costs of $100 for assault and $50 for disorderly conduct.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant married in February 1981 and the first of his three sons was born that August.  By 1988, Applicant had three children (other sons born in 1984 and 
1987) and was doing masonry work on the side. Two or three times a week, Applicant consumed beer in the evening while meeting with contractors to discuss 
masonry jobs. On occasion, he imbibed mixed drinks. Concerned he was drinking alcohol too frequently, Applicant voluntarily underwent alcohol treatment in 
1988. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant maintained abstinence from alcohol thereafter until 1992, when he began to drink beer after a patio job proved unsatisfactory and he had to remove 
seven yards of concrete.  His spouse caught him drinking, which further strained a relationship marked by discord over her spending habits and issues related to 
the rearing of their three sons. Applicant sought alcohol treatment in 1992, but their relationship continued to deteriorate and they divorced in January 1994. 
Applicant arranged for $320.00 per week to be garnished from his paycheck for payment of child support.</P> 
 
<P> Circa 1994, Applicant began a cohabitant relationship on the rebound  with a woman who used illegal drugs and alcohol. He imbibed alcohol on a daily basis 
with old friends after work and after his second job on the weekends. During this period, Applicant failed to make payments on at least one credit card, and 
$1,962 was charged off in February 1994. In June 1994, in addition to his drinking, Applicant began snorting cocaine on a daily basis in the parking lots of bars 
or clubs. After several weeks of daily use, he reduced his involvement with cocaine to weekly. Two or three months into his use, Applicant began to purchase 
cocaine from his friends at a cost of $100.00 per week. He worked overtime to support his weekly use, which continued to May 1995.</P> 
 
<P> In February 1995, Applicant had an argument with his girlfriend during which he forced her out of the door of their apartment by kicking her in the derriere. 
The next day, Applicant went to the home of his girlfriend's parents looking for her. She contacted the police and complained Applicant had grabbed her by the 
upper arm, and had also kicked her while wearing work boots the day before. Applicant was stopped in the area and arrested for assault and battery with a 
dangerous weapon (the work boots). Applicant admitted to the judge in court that he had a drinking problem that contributed to his anger toward his 
girlfriend.<A HREF="01-26209.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In early April 1995, the charge was amended to simple assault and battery, to which he pleaded guilty as he and his girlfriend were reconciling 
(which was not successful), and his case was continued without a finding for one year with conditions of supervision (including no alcohol abuse) and three 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per week.</P> 
 
<P>Imbibing large amounts of vodka and using cocaine, Applicant began to have attendance problems at work in 1995. Realizing he needed to make a complete 
lifestyle change, he sought the assistance of his supervisor and of the benefits manager at work. Advised by the latter that he should consider a detoxification 
program, Applicant admitted himself for detoxification in May 1995 to a local hospital. Diagnosed by a staff physician as suffering from alcohol dependence 
and cocaine dependence, Applicant was placed on Ativan protocol. Three days later, following a safe withdrawal and some individual and group counseling, 
Applicant was discharged with a recommendation of day treatment. Applicant elected to pursue outpatient counseling, but he did not follow through after three 
visits as his employer rescinded his flex time.</P> 
 
<P>In violation of his probation, Applicant failed to report to his probation officer, to pay his probation fee or to attend the required number of AA meetings. In 
mid-June 1995, he was ordered by the court to appear for alleged violations of probation. The order of surrender was dismissed in July 1995.</P> 
 
<P>In Fall 1995, Applicant was out of work on a medical leave of absence related to stomach problems. Applicant failed to respond to a request by his employer to 
call or return to work, and he was terminated from his job. Applicant appealed the termination, and he was reinstated one year later with seniority but no back 
pay. Applicant got behind on his financial obligations due to lack of income. He began taking cash advances from his credit cards to pay his child support 
obligation. In late October 1997, his court-ordered child support was increased from $292 to $317 weekly with the $25 extra going to arrearage.</P> 
 
<P>Circa 1996, Applicant and his current girlfriend moved in together. Applicant resumed his consumption of alcohol. From 1996 to at least July 2001, Applicant 
imbibed "a couple of beers" occasionally at his home when watching a sporting event or at a family gathering.</P> 
 
<P>Informed that he needed a security clearance for his duties, Applicant on January 17, 2000, executed a security clearance application (SF 86). He disclosed he 
had been arrested for assault in 1995, used cocaine weekly from June 1994 to May 1995, and been counseled for alcohol at a local hospital in May 1995. He 
also reported outstanding debts of $2,000 incurred in August 1995, and garnishment of his wages in the amount of $320 weekly since January 1994 for child 
support.</P> 
 
<P>As of October 2000, Applicant had bad debts with four creditors totaling about $6,034 in the aggregate. Aware he had delinquent debts with two creditors, 
Applicant made no effort to make any payments, as he hoped to get a settlement from his employer for salary lost when he was out of work which he could 
devote to his old debts. He has heard nothing from his employer on the issue since sometime in 2001.</P> 
 
<P>On July 17, 2001, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) about his involvement with illegal drugs and alcohol, his 
criminal arrests, unresolved delinquencies, and his employment termination in 1995. Applicant detailed his use of cocaine from June 1994 to May 1995 and his 
purchase of the drug, which strained his finances. He acknowledged excessive alcohol consumption in 1988, and again from 1993 to 1995 after a significant 
period of abstinence. Following his counseling at the hospital in 1995, Applicant indicated he stopped drinking on his own until 1996, when he began the 
occasional consumption of beer that continues to date. Applicant denied any use of cocaine since 1995 or any intent of future involvement. With regard to his 
1995 arrest for assault on his former girlfriend, Applicant related he "pushed and shoved her while intoxicated and made an ill attempt to give her a kick." He 
admitted he had initially failed to adhere to the probation terms for the offense. Applicant did not dispute the delinquent debt reflected on his credit report, and 
expressed his intent to pay off his debts in full if given an acceptable settlement by his employer for his wrongful termination in 1995. Applicant related he and 
his girlfriend were living from paycheck to paycheck.</P> 
 
<P>Sometime in early November 2002, Applicant had a physical altercation with his girlfriend's brother  who was temporarily residing with them. An argument 
ensued after Applicant arrived home to find  all the stove burners turned on, the heat cranked up, and his girlfriend's brother passed out due to heroin use. The 
dispute became physical and Applicant was arrested on a phone complaint of assault and battery. The charge was dismissed without prejudice.</P> 
 
<P>At the request of DOHA, Applicant responded on November 18, 2002, to interrogatories concerning his alcohol use and financial status. Applicant indicated he 
was currently drinking "4-5 beers a day" but not to intoxication. Asked to provide documentation of the four outstanding debts he had discussed during his DSS 
interview, Applicant responded, "I had no idea that I owed money to these people. No one is after me." He provided a personal financial statement reflecting a 
monthly net remainder of $500 after payment of expenses and a savings plan loan.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant earned about $60,000.00 in 2002 because of overtime. Financially strapped as of July 2003, Applicant had made no payments on the $6,034 in 
delinquent debt owed and had made no effort to contact his employer about his back pay since 2001. He was paying for his oldest son to attend a private 
college. No longer required to pay child support for his 19-year-old son who elected not to attend college, Applicant has $292 per week being garnisheed from 
his paycheck for child support.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumes "a few beers here or there" when socializing with others outside the home. On occasion, he may drink four to five beers at a sitting. Having 
consumed a couple of beers the day before the hearing, Applicant cannot promise he will never drink alcohol again, but he considers his alcohol problem to be 
of the past. He no longer drinks to get drunk, as his girlfriend is dependent on him, especially for cooking and transportation.</P>

<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Sections 6.3 and E2.2. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed 
that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a 
single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring 
pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P>

<P>Under Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative 
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the 
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the 
trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the 
potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct 
cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Directive, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude 
the following with respect to guidelines J, G, F and E:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested for assault and battery in 1975, 1995, and 2002, following physical altercations with a police officer, with his then girlfriend, and with 
his current girlfriend's brother, respectively. The charges were either dismissed or continued without a formal adjudication of guilt. The Government is not 
bound by the legal disposition of an offense with respect to considering whether Applicant engaged in a criminal act  (<EM>see </EM>E2.A10.1.2.1., allegations of criminal 
conduct are potentially disqualifying).  Applicant admits to scuffling with the police officer when being placed in a jail cell in 1975. Although he now maintains 
that only pushed his ex-girlfriend out the door with his foot in 1995, he admitted to a DSS agent in 2001 he "pushed and shoved her while intoxicated and made 
an ill attempt to give her a kick." (Ex. 2). Applicant does not dispute that he wrestled with his girlfriend's brother in 2002, but he claims his actions were in 
self-defense. Whether his assault can be excused based on self-defense is a matter of mitigation. There is no pattern to these criminal incidents, given the 
passage of time between them, but a history of criminal activity still creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Under Guideline 
J, E2.A10.1.2.1. and E2.A10.1.2.2. (multiple lesser offenses) apply in this case.</P> 
 
<P> Applicant clearly exhibited poor judgment and a lack of self-control when he engaged in assaultive behavior. The 1975 offense, which involved underage 
drinking, is excused on the basis of his immaturity (<EM>see </EM>E2.2.1.4., which requires the adjudicator to consider the person's age and immaturity at the time of the 
conduct). Applicant's 1995 assault on his former girlfriend was in the context of a volatile personal relationship when Applicant was an active abuser of both 
alcohol and cocaine. Although he exhibited some minimization at the hearing as to the extent of his culpability (he testified he gave her a push rather than 
kicked her out the door), there is unlikely to be any recurrence. There is no evidence of any ongoing contact with this former girlfriend, or of any assault of his 
present girlfriend. He has remained with, and cared for her despite her significant disabilities, indicative of greater maturity and commitment to a personal 
relationship. With regard to the November 2002 incident at his home involving her brother, Applicant maintains he acted only after his  girlfriend's brother 
"went right for [his] throat." (Transcript p. 42). The Government relied solely on Applicant's accounts, submitting no arrest or court records to undermine his 
claim of self-defense, and the charge was dismissed, albeit without prejudice. Given the incidents of fighting have been aberrational, favorable findings are 
warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. of the SOR.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>While the Directive does not prohibit drinking per se, excessive alcohol consumption is of concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Applicant 
was concerned enough about his drinking to admit himself for detoxification and counseling in 1988 and 1992. As his marriage deteriorated, Applicant looked 
to alcohol as a release. Although Applicant now denies alcohol was involved in his February 1995 assault on his former girlfriend, he admitted to a DSS agent 
in July 2001 that he was intoxicated during the incident, and he was ordered to attend AA by the court. By May 1995, his drinking was affecting his attendance 
at work. On the advice of a benefits manager, Applicant underwent detoxification treatment at a local hospital where he was diagnosed as suffering from 
alcohol and cocaine dependence.</P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying conditions E2.A7.1.2.1.(alcohol related incidents away from work, such as . . . fighting), E2.A7.1.2.3. (diagnosis by a credentialed medical 
professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and E2.A7.1.2.5. (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment) are 
pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability. After his successful detoxification in May 1995, Applicant remained abstinent to sometime in 
1996. He has since consumed beer in quantity of up to four or five beers per occasion. A brief inpatient stay for detoxification is not considered alcohol 
rehabilitation, so E2.A7.1.2.6. (consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following 
completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) does not fit the facts of this case. However, his continued drinking after a diagnosis of alcoholism increases 
the risk of future alcohol-related impairment.</P> 
 
<P>As recently as November 2002, Applicant reported in interrogatories for DOHA that he was drinking four or five beers on a daily basis, which he maintains did 
not lead to his intoxication. Applicant now denies that he engaged in daily consumption either as of November 2002 or currently, and attributes his report of 
daily drinking to him "probably sitting with a few buddies in the tool room, bitching about all the paperwork [when he completed the interrogatories]" 
(Transcript p. 59).  Assuming Applicant's job is as important to him as he asserts, then it is not believable that he would indicate daily consumption of four or 
five beers if it was untrue. Applicant's continued consumption of alcohol in that amount, even on an occasional basis, presents a significant security risk. Under  
E2.A7.1.3.4., following a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, the individual is required to successfully complete inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with 
aftercare requirements, participate frequently in meetings of AA or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of at least twelve months, and 
have a favorable prognosis rendered by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program. Applicant has not received any alcohol treatment since his detoxification in May 1995. He is not involved in AA and sees no need for it. 
When asked whether he had a sponsor in AA, Applicant responded, "Who would want to sponsor someone that does drink?" (Transcript p. 67), demonstrating 
some recognition that his consumption is against AA tenets. Assuming Applicant has moderated his drinking since November 2002 based on the absence of any 
evidence of recent impairment, it is too soon to conclude that his alcohol problems are safely of the past. Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are found against 
him.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes about $6,034 in delinquent consumer debt which he has made no effort to resolve. Under Guideline F, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when he is shown to have a history of financial indebtedness, recurring financial difficulties, or a history of not meeting his financial 
obligations. Individuals who have demonstrated financial irresponsibility may be more susceptible to mishandling or compromising classified information or 
material for financial gain, or be at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.2.2. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and 
E2.A6.1.2.3. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply.</P> 
 
<P>The concern here is not with the fact that Applicant fell behind on four accounts, as his financial difficulties are attributable to the fact that he has had to pay in 
excess of $300 per week in child support and the lack of income during the 1995/96 time frame after he was terminated for failure to notify his employer of his 
inability to work due to illness. Mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. (conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control) applies in 
cases where the debt was not due to overspending or other financial irresponsibility.</P> 
 
<P>The salient issue is whether Applicant's failure to make any payments on the four delinquent debts can be excused because of factors outside of his control. 
Although Applicant indicated in response to financial interrogatories in November 2002 that he had no idea that he owed money to the four listed creditors, he 
had not disputed these debts when interviewed in July 2001. At that time, he expressed his intent to satisfy these debts on his receipt of a settlement from his 
employer for the income lost during the year he was off the job. Applicant has a very significant child support obligation plus arrearage that he pays through 
voluntary garnishment of his wages. He also is required to pay some of the costs associated with one son's college education. With his girlfriend's disability, 
Applicant lacks the means to pay his old delinquencies, as they live "paycheck to paycheck." It appears Applicant is not in a financial position to pay these old 
debts without his employer's settlement. Applicant admitted at his hearing that the last conversation he had with his employer's representative on this matter 
was two years ago.  Applicant maintains, not rebutted by the Government, he was told it was an issue between the company and the union, so he could do 
nothing about it. Applicant timely pays his living expenses. There is no evidence of any new delinquencies or extravagant expenditure that might suggest a 
cavalier attitude toward his financial obligations. While the debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., 3.c. and 3.d. have yet to be satisfied, Applicant has 
provided a reasonable explanation for his failure to pay them as well as a record of attention to more immediate financial obligations. A favorable outcome is 
warranted as to the financial considerations concerns.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's knowing violation of his probation by failing to attend AA in 1995, and his consumption of alcohol against medical advice since 1996, bear 
negative security implications, not only for the state of his rehabilitation from diagnosed alcohol dependence, but also for the quality of his personal judgment 
and reliability. Guideline E concerns are raised by conduct involving questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations (<EM>see 
</EM>E2.A5.1.2.5., a pattern of rule violations). Whereas Applicant has not violated a specific regulation or written agreement by continuing to drink after being 
advised to abstain, E2.A5.1.2.5. is not directly applicable to this case, but his ongoing consumption of alcohol, in quantity of four or five beers on occasion, 
precludes me from finding that he possesses the requisite good judgment that must be demanded of those with access. SOR subparagraph 4.a. is resolved 
against him.</P>

(Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant provided conflicting accounts of alcohol involvement on that occasion. When interviewed on July 17, 2001, Applicant indicated he was 
intoxicated. (Ex. 2). He testified at his hearing that he had not consumed any alcohol that night, although he had a drinking problem. (Transcript p. 47). 
Applicant also testified that when the officers arrested him (the day after he kicked his girlfriend) they administered field sobriety tests. Such tests are not 
routinely done without some indication that the person had been drinking alcohol, so it is likely he had consumed alcohol on at least the day of his arrest. 
Applicant also denies that he inflicted any injury on his former girlfriend, although he admits he pushed her out the door with his foot while he had his work 
boots on. (Transcript p. 45). There is sufficient evidence to find he assaulted her.</SPAN></P>
