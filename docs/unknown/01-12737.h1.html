<P>Applicant who used illicit substances over recurrent periods, experienced alcohol-related arrests and underwent in-patient drug and alcohol counseling and 
treatment in 1994 following a failed urinalysis, falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) and failed to correct his omissions in prompt fashion when 
afforded the opportunity to do so in an ensuing Defense Security Service (DSS) interview, does not extenuate or mitigate his omissions sufficiently to 
demonstrate the requisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to overcome raised judgment and reliability concerns arising under personal conduct 
guidelines to meet minimum security clearance eligibility requirements under the Adjudication Guidelines and the E.2.3 factors.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">             On December 26, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on January 22, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on February 8, 2002, and on 
February 11, 2002, was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on March 7, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three 
exhibits; Applicant relied on five witnesses (including himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on March 14, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 39-year old systems integrator employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have falsified his SF-86 executed in September 1999 by omitting: (a) omitting his two alcohol related arrests of 1980 and 1984 when 
responding <STRONG>no</STRONG> to question 24, (b) omitting his use of cocaine twice monthly from late 1992 to at least December 1983 when  responding <STRONG>no </STRONG>to question 27, &copy;) 
omitting his testing positive for cocaine in an administered  random urinalysis test as an employment condition of employment in a sensitive position when 
answering <STRONG>no </STRONG>to question 28 and (d) omitting his being previously diagnosed for cocaine addiction and alcohol abuser and undergoing in-patient drug and 
alcohol counseling and treatment in January 1994 when answering <STRONG>no </STRONG>to question 30.  Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have concealed his past use of 
illegal drugs when questioned by a DSS agent in a March 2000 interview.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on his SF-86 and DSS interview omissions, Applicant is alleged to have committed criminal conduct by violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (a felony).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admits his omissions while denying any intent to falsify.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is intelligent and well educated, holding a bachelors degree in computer science from an accredited university.  He has no identified disabilities of 
any kind that might impair his ability to understand Government security forms.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While employed by the Army (between 1981 and 1982), Applicant experimented with marijuana.  Not until he moved out of his mother's home and into an 
apartment-sharing relationship with a roommate did he begin to snort cocaine: not habitually, but only recreationally about twice a month when socializing at 
parties.  This recreational use of cocaine persisted for about a year before he recognized the harm it was causing and quit it altogether.   During this time he 
purchased small amounts of the substance for his personal use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was employed as a security officer and security supervisor with a prior civilian employer between 1984 and February 1995.  As a condition of 
employment, he was required  to submit to random urinalysis for detection of drugs.  In an otherwise routine random urinalysis he submitted to in the Fall of 
1993, he tested positive for cocaine (his first such positive test) and was given a company warning and suspended from work.  Several months later (in 
December 1993) Applicant submitted to another random urinalysis, which once again produced a positive result.  This brought another suspension from his 
employer, required entry into a drug abuse program, and demotion from his security supervisor position to the post of security officer (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in January 1994, Applicant (acting on his prior employer's directions) entered into a two-week inpatient drug rehabilitation program, which he 
followed with recommended outpatient counseling for about a year.  Applicant ensures he has not used any illegal drugs since his last positive test in 1993.  
After completing his treatment, he moved home to live with his mother and ceased associating with individuals who use illegal drugs.  He has not used illegal 
drugs since he lasted tested positive for cocaine.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked to execute his SF-86 in September 1999, Applicant withheld information regarding his (a) two alcohol-related arrests, (b) prior use and purchases 
of illegal substances, (c)  use of illegal substances while holding a sensitive position and his in-patient counseling, and (d) treatment for illegal substance abuse 
following his failed random urinalysis test in January 1994.  Applicant sought no advice from anyone from his employer's security office about filling out his 
SF-86 (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 37) and freely attributes each of his omissions to his concern at the time that disclosure would negatively impact upon his employment (<EM>see</EM> 
ex. 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a follow-up interview conducted by a DSS agent in March 2000, Applicant was afforded  an opportunity to disclose his prior drug use and alcohol-related 
arrests, but limited his disclosure to just his alcohol-related incidents.  When specifically asked by the agent whether he had ever used illegal drugs, he answered 
in the negative.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over six months later (in September 2000), the same DSS agent returned to interview Applicant about his drug use.  Applicant acknowledges that the agent 
seemed to be armed with adverse information about covered areas of his SF-86 omissions.  To this extent, he can be characterized as "tipped" about what he 
believed the agent had independently compiled about his use of drugs and alcohol (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 40).  Being tipped, though, is not enough to equate with 
confrontation.  Before he could be directly confronted with the facts about his drug activity, Applicant fully disclosed his arrests, the extent of his prior 
involvement with illegal substances, and his in-patient counseling/treatment (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  He also expressed remorse for the bad judgment he exhibited in failing 
to disclose his illegal substance abuse  on his SF-86 and during his previous March 2000 DSS interview.  Applicant's disclosures are accepted as truthful, albeit 
late.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by colleagues and supervisors with both his employer and National Guard command.  All of his supervisors and colleagues accord 
him high marks for overall reliability and trustworthiness.  And he has received excellent performance evaluations from his employer and command.  Not all of 
his references, though, appear to have been made fully aware of his SF-86 and DSS interview omissions, however, and the value of their positive assessments 
must be discounted considerably when gauging Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness for meeting his fiducial responsibilities to the US Government (<EM>see 
</EM>R.T., at 65 (witness B), 74 (witness C), and 79 (witness D)).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3 Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2 The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3  The individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2  The crime was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6 There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant 
for the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a praiseworthy civilian and military record, but also with raised security concerns over his omission of alcohol-related arrests, illegal substance involvement and drug-related counseling/treatment in his executed SF-86 and ensuing DSS interview, that cloud the confidence 
in his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required to access him to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's respective SF-86 omissions of his alcohol-related arrests, illegal substance involvement, and in-patient counseling and treatment.  So much trust is 
imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for incidents of trust betrayal are calibrated narrowly. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant falsified his SF-86 in several material respects: omitting his two alcohol-related arrests, his past use and purchases of cocaine and his history of in-patient counseling and treatment for illegal substance abuse.  He makes no claim of misunderstanding the questions, which were posed in a straightforward way 
in the questionnaire.  Applicant attributes his omissions to concern about how disclosure of the adverse information would impact on his employment: 
understandable certainly, but historically considered by our Appeal Board to be insufficient to avert drawn conclusions of knowing and wilful concealment. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Motivation is the key here and provides the all too critical backdrop by which Applicant's omission explanations must be assessed, both in the way he 
approached his SF-86 and his ensuing first DSS interview (<EM>viz., </EM>the March 2000 interview).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even obvious omissions of material facts (to alcohol-related 
arrests, illegal drug involvement and in-patient counseling and treatment, as here) may be mitigated where circumstances indicate the declarant was under some 
mistaken impression or understanding when he executed a government form (such as an SF-86) or signed off on a deficient signed, sworn statement.  <EM>Cf. 
Raybourne v. Gulf Atlantic Towing Corp.</EM>, 276 F.2d 90, 92 (4th Cir. 1960).  Disqualifying conditions (DC) 2 and 3 of the Directive's Change 4 amendments and 
relevant case authorities underscore the importance of motive and subjective intent considerations in gauging knowing and wilful behavior.  <EM>Cf. United States v. 
Chapin</EM>, 515 F.2d 1274, 1283-84 (DC Cir. 1975); <EM>United States Steinhilber</EM>, 484 F.2d 386, 389-90 (8th Cir. 1973); <EM>United States v. Diogo</EM>, 320 F.2d 898, 905 
(2d Cir. 1963). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But  Applicant makes clear that he approached questions 24, 27, 28 and 30 of his SF-86 with the intent to withhold as much adverse information about his 
arrests, drug use and drug counseling/treatment as he could reasonably escape with.  His omissions were knowing, deliberate and material to a determination 
about his clearance suitability.  They invite application of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: DC 2 
(falsification of a security questionnaire) and DC 3 (providing false information to an investigator).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to take advantage of the first obvious opportunity afforded him to correct his earlier SF-86 
omissions in his initial DSS interview.  Not only has our Appeal Board found the use of mitigating condition (MC) 2 of the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
personal conduct (isolated, corrected falsification) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as isolated, but it has denied 
applicants availability of MC 3 (prompt, good faith disclosure) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has failed to take advantage of an earlier 
DSS interview opportunity.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant in the present case is on record with bypassing his first afforded opportunity to correct his omissions and waiting until his second DSS interview 
months later (in September 2000) to come forward with the true facts about his covered actions.  Our Appeal Board has been quite clear for a number of years 
now that an applicant cannot be credited with a prompt, good faith correction where he has tacitly repeated his omissions  and waited over six months for 
another DSS interview before electing to come forward with corrections.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).  Applicant, accordingly, may not take 
advantage of either MC 2 (isolated omissions) or MC 3 (prompt, good faith correction of the falsification) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No question but that Applicant has inspired confidence and trust among his defense contractor colleagues and National Guard command (further reflected in his 
excellent performance appraisals).  But in the face of his repeated acts of omission, his favorable character evidence alone is not enough to absorb security 
concerns extant with the Government over his failure to be truthful through both his SF-86 and initial DSS interview.  Mitigation is further weakened by the 
qualifications expressed by most of his character witnesses: lack of awareness of Applicant's omissions of material information on his SF-86 and in his initial 
face-to-face DSS interview.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to sub-paras. 1.a through 1.e of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal coverage of falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That none of Applicant's SF-86 omissions resulted in formal charges and adjudication against Applicant does not mean that the falsification issues may not be 
raised and considered anew in a clearance proceeding such as the present.  Our Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the Government can prove applicant 
engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).  Applicant's ultimate coming 
forward with his full disclosure of his prior arrest and drug involvement in a second DSS interview, while insufficient to mitigate the security implication of his 
prior falsification under the personal conduct guidelines, is sufficient to mitigate any criminal implications that might be drawn from his SF-86 omissions. 
Enough time is passed on these covered allegations (almost three years) to mitigate this conduct under both MC 1 (criminal behavior not recent) and MC 2 
(isolated conduct), and to a more limited extent on the strength of MC 6 (clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) by considering Applicant's overall 
trustworthiness he has demonstrated with his professional colleagues and National Guard command.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-para. 2.a of 
Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) 
of the Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>
