  An applicant can waive his or her objection to the admissibility of evidence even though the Directive is silent on the matter of waiver.  Although general rules of law can be cited as persuasive authority in areas where the Directive is silent or ambiguous, general legal rules or principles do not supersede a party's right to insist on  compliance with specific provisions of the Directive.  If a document objected to by an applicant falls under the terms of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item  E3.1.22, then the unavailability of a witness to testify about that document is relevant only to the extent that such unavailability falls under one of the specific exceptions of  Item E3.1.22.  An applicant's right to confrontation in these proceedings is not the same as, or equivalent to, a criminal defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  In making a decision about the admissibility of documents under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.20 and  E3.1.22, even if a Judge concludes that a document is not admissible under one of those two provisions, it does not necessarily follow that the document is not admissible  under the other provision.  Board does not review the record evidence <EM>de novo</EM> and engage in appellate fact-finding.  Although Department Counsel has demonstrate the  Judge erred in ruling on the admissibility of certain documents, the proper remedy in this case is remand, not reversal.  Case remanded with instructions.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 17, 2003 which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  
Administrative Judge James A. Young issued a favorable security clearance decision dated January 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not admitting portions of Government Exhibit 2 based on Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22; (2) in the alternative, even if the Administrative Judge was correct in concluding portions of Government Exhibit 2 were 
not admissible under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22, whether the Administrative Judge erred by excluding those  portions of Government 
Exhibit 2 because they are admissible under well-established exceptions to the hearsay rule; (3) whether the excluded portions of Government Exhibit 2 satisfy 
Department Counsel's burden of proof under the Directive and Applicant failed to refute, explain, or mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's conduct; and (4) 
whether the Administrative Judge's favorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board remands the case to the 
Administrative Judge for further processing consistent with the Board's rulings and instructions.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not admitting portions of Government Exhibit 2 based on Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22</SPAN>.  At the 
hearing Department Counsel offered a collection of National Security Agency (NSA) documents pertaining to NSA's decision to deny Applicant access to Sensitive 
Compartmented Information.  Those documents were marked as Government Exhibits 2a through 2i.  Applicant objected to the admissibility of the NSA documents 
marked as Government Exhibits 2c, 2d, 2g, and 2i, contending they should be not be admitted as evidence in support of the SOR allegations.  The Administrative Judge 
sustained Applicant's objections to those four documents.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Later in the hearing, the Judge ruled that he would admit those four documents into evidence, but only for 
limited evidentiary purposes and not as evidence in support of the SOR allegations.  The Judge's ruling concerning the limited admissibility of Government Exhibits 2c, 2d, 
2g, and 2i is the focus of this appeal.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by excluding Government Exhibit 2c based on Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.  In 
support of that contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) Government Exhibit 2c is the functional equivalent of Applicant's admissions to an NSA investigator and the 
Board has held that such admissions are not excludable under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22; and (b) the unavailability of the NSA investigator 
as a witness was outside the control of Department Counsel.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues the Judge properly excluded Government Exhibit 2c based on Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22 because: (i) Applicant has never 
adopted Government Exhibit 2c as his own statement; (ii) the Board decision relied on by Department Counsel is distinguishable on its facts; (iii) Department Counsel's 
argument about the unavailability of the NSA investigator is not well founded; and (iv) Department Counsel did not obtain an exception for Government Exhibit 2c as 
authorized by Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.</P> 
 
<P>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22 states:</P> 
 
<P>"A written or oral statement adverse to the applicant on a controverted issue may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge without affording an 
opportunity to cross-examine the person making the statement orally, or in writing when justified by the circumstances, only in either of the following  circumstances: </P> 
 
<P>E3.1.22.1.  If the head of the Department or Agency supplying the statement certifies that the person who furnished the information is a confidential informant who has 
been engaged in obtaining intelligence information for the Government and that disclosure of his or her identity would be substantially harmful to the national interest; or</P> 
 
<P>E3.1.22.2.  If the [General Counsel], DoD, has determined the statement concerned appears to be relevant, material, and reliable; failure to receive and consider the 
statement would be substantially harmful to the national security; and the person who furnished the information cannot appear to testify due to the following:</P> 
 
<P>E3.1.22.2.1.  Death, severe illness, or similar cause, in which case the identity of the person and the information to be considered shall be made available to the applicant; 
or</P> 
 
<P>E3.1.22.2.2.  Some other cause determined by the Secretary of Defense, or when appropriate by the Department or Agency head, to be good and sufficient."</P> 
 
<P>If Department Counsel had presented evidence that Applicant had adopted Government Exhibit 2c as his own, then that document would be admissible without any need 
to consider its admissibility under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant persuasively argues that Department Counsel did not 
present such evidence in this case.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>To the extent that Department Counsel argues about the unavailability of the NSA investigator to testify, that argument does not show the Administrative Judge erred.  If a 
document  objected to by an applicant falls under the terms of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22,<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> then the unavailability of a witness to testify 
about that document is relevant only to the extent such unavailability falls under one of the specific exceptions of Item E3.1.22.  Provisions of the Directive should not be 
construed or interpreted in a manner that renders them meaningless or superfluous.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, the Board has ruled that general rules or principles of law cannot be 
invoked to override or circumvent specific provisions of the Directive.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, whatever persuasive authority there is in federal case law about the legal effect of 
the unavailability of witnesses on the admissibility of evidence, that case law does not supersede or override the specific provisions of Item E3.1.22 that cover situations 
involving the unavailability of witnesses.  Finally, the Board has applied canons of statutory construction when construing or interpreting provisions of the Directive.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  It is 
a canon of statutory construction that when a federal statute sets forth specific exceptions, a court will not construe or interpret the statute to include exceptions beyond 
those specifically included in the statute.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The Board does not have the jurisdiction or authority to revise or expand the specific exceptions set forth in Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.  Applicant correctly notes Department Counsel did not show that any of the exceptions listed under Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22 applies to Government Exhibit 2c.</P> 
 
<P>For all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that Department Counsel's appeal arguments in support of this appeal issue are not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">In the alternative, whether the Administrative Judge erred by excluding portions of Government Exhibit 2 because they are admissible under well-established exceptions 
to the hearsay rule</SPAN>.  Department Counsel argues, in the alternative, that the Administrative Judge erred because: (a) the Board has held that documents can be admissible 
in these proceedings if they fall under well-established exceptions to the hearsay rule; and (b) Government Exhibit 2c is admissible under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.20 as either a business record or a public record.  In response, Applicant argues: (i) the general hearsay exceptions relied on by Department Counsel 
in this case do not allow it to circumvent the requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 with respect to reports of investigation; and (ii) 
Government Exhibit 2c is not admissible under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20.</P> 
 
<P>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 states:</P> 
 
<P>"Official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business, other than DoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be received 
and considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses, provided that such information has been furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its 
responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified information within industry 
under E.O. 10865 (enclosure 1).  An ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 
U.S.C. 101 <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">et</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">seq</SPAN>. (reference (d))."</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that the Board has held that an applicant's right to confrontation in these proceedings is not more expansive than a criminal 
defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Relying on that conclusion, the Board has rejected claims by applicants that have 
the practical effect of asserting a right to confrontation that goes beyond the right of confrontation to which a criminal defendant was entitled under the Sixth Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution.  However, although the Board has rejected claims by applicants that exceed the outer perimeter of a criminal defendant's rights under the Sixth 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the Board has not been required to decide whether an applicant's right to confrontation is the same as, or equivalent to, a criminal 
defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Since Applicant's arguments in this case do not make a claim that he has a right of 
confrontation that is greater than a criminal defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, the Board's prior decisions are not readily 
dispositive of this appeal.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is limited to criminal cases.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Nothing in Executive Order 10865 or the Directive indicates that an applicant is entitled to 
invoke the protections of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, an applicant is not entitled to receive in these proceedings the procedural 
protections afforded to criminal defendants.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, because DOHA proceedings are civil, administrative proceedings, an applicant is not entitled to claim a right 
of confrontation that is the same as, or equivalent to, a criminal defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  However, to 
decide this appeal, the Board need not try to decide what are the general parameters of an applicant's right to confrontation under the Directive.  That is because the 
Board construes Applicant's arguments as basing his right to confrontation claim on specific provisions of the Directive (<EM>i.e.</EM>, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.20 and E3.1.22).<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>There is no general prohibition against the use of hearsay evidence in federal administrative proceedings, including hearings under the industrial security program.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  
However, that general legal principle does not supersede Applicant's right to insist on compliance with the specific provisions of Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.20 and E3.1.22.  Although general rules of law can be cited as persuasive authority in areas where the Directive is silent or ambiguous,  general 
rules of law do not override or supersede specific provisions of the Directive.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the case law indicating that hearsay evidence can be admitted and relied on 
in federal administrative proceedings can be followed in these proceedings to the extent its application does not run contrary to a specific provision of the Directive that a 
party does not waive.</P> 
 
<P>Government Exhibit 2c is a report of an NSA investigation of Applicant.  Accordingly, Government Exhibit 2c is a report of investigation that falls under Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 and is not admissible unless: (a) Applicant waives any objection to its admission; or (b) Department Counsel satisfies the 
requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Since Applicant objected to the admissibility of Government Exhibit 2c, Department 
Counsel was required to satisfy the requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 before Government Exhibit 2c could be admitted into 
evidence.  However, because Government Exhibits 2d, 2g, and 2i are not reports of investigation,<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> their admissibility under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Item E3.1.20 must be determined separately from the admissibility of Government Exhibit 2c.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>To resolve this appeal, the Board need not decide what is the precise relationship between Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 and Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.  This case is being remanded to the Administrative Judge for further processing.  On remand, the Judge will be faced with 
a need to consider the admissibility of Government Exhibits 2c, 2d, 2g, and 2i in light of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20.  As noted earlier in this 
decision, the Directive should not be interpreted or construed in a manner that renders any provision meaningless or superfluous.  Accordingly, in making a decision about 
the admissibility of Government Exhibits 2c, 2d, 2g, and 2i under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.20, the Judge must strive to avoid rendering 
either Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 or Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22 meaningless or superfluous.  Stated 
otherwise, a conclusion that a document is not admissible under one of those two provisions does not necessarily mean that a document is not admissible under the other 
provision.<A HREF="02-12199.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the excluded portions of Government Exhibit 2 satisfy Department Counsel's burden of proof under the Directive and Applicant failed to refute, explain, or 
mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's conduct</SPAN>.  Department Counsel argues that correction of the Administrative Judge's erroneous exclusion of portions of 
Government Exhibit 2 leads to the conclusion that Department Counsel established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case and that Applicant failed to refute, explain, or mitigate the <EM>prima 
facie</EM> case against him.  This argument lacks merit.</P> 
 
<P>Even if the Board concludes that an Administrative Judge erroneously excluded evidence, it is not the function of the Board to admit that evidence into the record, engage 
in appellate fact-finding, and reach its own conclusions <EM>de novo</EM> as to an applicant's security eligibility.  If the Board concludes that a Judge erroneously excluded 
evidence, then the proper course of action for the Board would be to decide whether the error was harmful or harmless under the particular facts and circumstances of the 
case.  If the Board decides that the error was harmful, then the proper remedy would be to remand the case to the Judge with instructions.  In this case, remand is the 
appropriate remedy, not reversal.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) the 
Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Department Counsel did not establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case; and (b) Applicant's conduct demonstrates poor judgment under 
Guideline E even if the Judge were to accept Applicant's explanation.  Applicant counters by arguing: (i) Department Counsel failed to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case 
against him; and (ii) there is no nexus between Applicant's conduct and his security eligibility.</P> 
 
<P>Because the Board is remanding this case to the Administrative Judge for further processing, it would be premature for the Board to address this appeal issue.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating error below that warrants remand.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.2, the 
Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge with the following instructions:</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge must reopen the record to permit the parties the opportunity to submit written argument as to the admissibility of Government Exhibits 2d, 2g, 
and 2i under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 and Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22.  As to Government Exhibit 2c, the 
Judge need not address the admissibility of Government Exhibit 2c under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22, but must decide whether Department 
Counsel has satisfied the requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20 such that Government Exhibit 2c is admissible under that provision of 
the Directive.  The Judge, in his discretion, may reopen the record to allow the parties to present evidence pertinent to this evidentiary issue if the Judge determines either 
party has made a showing of good cause for  such additional evidence.</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge concludes that any of the four documents are admissible beyond the limited purposes for which he originally admitted them, then the Judge has 
the discretion to reopen the record evidence to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to present additional evidence relevant to the admitted document(s) or the 
matters covered by the admitted document(s).</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge should then issue a new decision that complies with the requirements of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.35 and Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> In sustaining Applicant's objection, the Administrative Judge explicitly mentioned and relied on Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.22, but did not 
mention or discuss Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20. 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> Portions of Department Counsel's appeal brief and Applicant's rely brief focus on Government Exhibit 2c, and other portions make arguments that could extend to all 
four of the Government Exhibits in question.  For purposes of deciding this appeal, the Board will construe the arguments of both parties as potentially covering all four of 
the Government Exhibits in question.  To the extent the Board needs to distinguish among the four Government Exhibits to address the issues raised on appeal, it will do so 
in its discussion of the appeal issues. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> Department Counsel does not claim that Government Exhibits 2d, 2g, and 2i are statements by Applicant, and that position is understandable given the nature of those 
three documents.  However, the fact that Applicant has not adopted those documents as reflecting statements by him does not foreclose the need for the Administrative 
Judge to decide whether those three documents are admissible on other grounds.  Nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or generally accepted principles of 
federal administrative law limits documentary evidence in these proceedings to only those documents created, or adopted, by an applicant.

<P><A NAME="N_11_">11. </A> Department Counsel and Applicant cite to Board decisions that are the progeny of the Board decision in ISCR Case No. 88-2173 (September 14, 1990).  In that 
decision, the Board relied on <EM>Ohio v. Roberts</EM>, 448 U.S. 56 (1980).  Earlier this year, the Supreme Court overruled <EM>Ohio v. Roberts</EM>.  <EM>See Crawford v. Washington</EM>, 
541 U.S. -- (slip op., March 8, 2004).  Given that change in Supreme Court precedent, the continued viability of the Board decision in ISCR Case No. 88-2173 cannot 
be taken for granted.  <EM>Cf.</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24254 (June 29, 2004) at p. 7 (no one should assume that the precedential value of a Board decision issued before a 
change in the law is the same after the change in the law).  However, to resolve this appeal, the Board need not decide whether its decision in ISCR Case No. 88-2173 
should be distinguished, overruled, modified, or followed for alternative reasons.

Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.20 and E3.1.22 are compatible with the provisions of Executive Order 10865.  Under the Directive, such a determination is 
not reviewable in DOHA proceedings.

2c is admissible under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20.
