<P>Applicant is 35 years old and is employed as a senior consultant for a defense contractor.  He used and purchased marijuana in the past and he has used cocaine 
at least twice.  Applicant was in high school when he first used marijuana out of curiosity.  He continued using marijuana in college.  After graduating from 
college with his second bachelor's degree, he moved out of the living accommodations he shared with roommates; they too smoked marijuana.  Living in his 
own place, he stopped using drugs of any kind because he wanted to concentrate on his career and he knew drug use could be an impediment to upward 
mobility.  Applicant's approximately three years of abstinence from drugs, together with his credibly stated intention not to use marijuana or cocaine in the 
future, successfully mitigates the security drug involvement concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On December 30, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Applicant answered the SOR on 
January 7, 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>On April 4, 2005, the case was assigned to me.  A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on April 22, 2005, and the hearing was held on May 6, 2005.  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on May 17, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a single, 35-year-old senior consultant for a defense contractor.  He was in high school when he first tried marijuana out of curiosity and that was in 
the Fall or Spring of 1988 or 1989; he was about 18 at the time.  He then went on to college, where he played soccer and did not smoke marijuana at all during 
that time.  Applicant was drug free from May 1989 when he graduated from high school through August 1993 when he graduated from college.</P> 
<P>Between the Fall of 1993 and Winter of 1994 through 2002, he used and purchased marijuana occasionally; his purchase of the drug was solely for his own use.  
Applicant enrolled in a new college in 1995 and graduated in 1998.  In the Fall of 1997 through his graduation in 1998, he occasionally used marijuana 4-5 
times a week.  From college graduation in 1998 into 1999, he did not use marijuana.</P> 
<P>Applicant used cocaine at least twice when he was 24 years old, from about 1993 to 1994.  He was offered the cocaine in two different social settings and tried 
it because he was curious.  Not liking how cocaine made him feel, he refused to use it in the future when it was offered.</P> 
<P>He has been drug free of both marijuana and cocaine since June 2002 and no longer associates with people who use drugs.  Applicant credibly testified that his 
drug use was clearly behind him and that it was his career and his future endeavors in life that are of paramount importance now.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline.  Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline H, pertaining to drug involvement, with its respective DC and MC, applies in this case.  Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair 
and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the 
Directive.  Specifically, these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; 
(3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation, and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">the case against him.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline H - Drug Involvement:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.  Applicant's admissions and the government's documentary evidence support the 
application of two disqualifying conditions under Guideline H of the Directive, specifically: Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 
(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>any drug abuse</EM>) and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>illegal possession including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>), apply in this case.  
Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from about 1998 to at least June 2002.  However, there were periods between when he was 
drug free for years.  He also used cocaine twice from about 1993 to 1994</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) and specifically considered DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the drug involvement was not 
recent</EM>) and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>) and conclude they apply.  Applicant tried marijuana in high school.  
He then went on to college and was drug free for four years.  When he attended a different university for his second bachelor's degree , he started using 
marijuana again, and purchased it for his own use.  He tried cocaine on at least two occasions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant graduated with this second bachelor's degree in June 2002, disassociated himself from his old college roommates by moving into his own place and 
stopped drug use immediately, knowing that it could have a negative impact on his career.  He no longer associated with people who used drugs.  He indicated: 
"I have found other values to be of greater importance than getting high to have fund.  I have no further plans or desires to use marijuana.<A HREF="03-24951.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>"  Although his 
illegal conduct reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and suggests that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information 
he has abstained from the use of any drugs since June 2002.  His approximately three years of abstinence shows that his drug use was not recent, together with 
his credibly stated intention not to use drugs in the future, is sufficient to overcome the government's case under Guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all the evidence in this case.  I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting 
our national interests.  I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by his drug 
involvement.  Accordingly, subparagraphs l.a through 1.c of the SOR are decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
