  Although an Administrative Judge must make findings, reach conclusions, and apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines to each allegation in an SOR, the Judge also must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept after considering the record evidence as a  whole.  Applicant's security eligibility does not turn on the Judge's findings and conclusions with respect to one paragraph of the SOR, but rather on the  Judge's findings and conclusions about the overall facts and circumstances of Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  Applicant's ability to argue for an  alternate interpretation of the record evidence does not demonstrate the Judge's interpretation of that evidence is arbitrary or capricious.  Given the record  evidence in this case, the Judge had a rational basis for his conclusion that Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 was not applicable.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August 11, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated January 20, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's formal finding against Applicant that she had a monthly net remainder 
of $226, as stated in SOR paragraph 1.c, is arbitrary and capricious; (2) whether the record evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that Applicant 
demonstrated no intention of satisfying the medical debt until her financial situation improved enough to accommodate the debts without sacrificing her and her 
husband's comfort; (3) whether the Judge erred by not applying Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6; and (4) whether the Judge's errors are 
harmful.<A HREF="02-28891.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's formal finding against Applicant that she had a monthly net remainder of $226, as stated in SOR paragraph 1.c, is 
arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN>   The Administrative Judge correctly noted that, in a written statement Applicant gave to a Defense Security Service investigator in 
August 2002, Applicant had indicated she and her husband had a net remainder of $226 a month after paying their expenses (Decision at p. 2).  Applicant 
correctly notes that, at the hearing (held in December 2003), she presented evidence in support of her claim that she and her husband had less than $226 a 
month in income after paying their expenses.  Although the Judge did not specifically refer to that evidence, or make a specific finding as to how much 
Applicant and her husband had left as a net monthly remainder as of the date of the hearing, the Judge did conclude that Applicant failed to pay her delinquent 
medical debt despite having income exceeding her expenses (Decision at p. 3).</P> 
 
<P>There is no requirement that an Administrative Judge specifically mention and discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  However, the  Judge's failure 
to make a specific finding as how much Applicant and her husband had left as a net monthly remainder as of the date of the hearing is somewhat problematic 
given such a finding would be relevant to SOR paragraph 1.c..  However, even if the Board were to assume -- solely for purposes of deciding this appeal -- 
that Applicant is correct in contending that the record evidence shows she and her husband have a net monthly remainder of less than $226 a month, Applicant 
does not persuasively show the Judge committed harmful error.</P> 
 
<P>Although an Administrative Judge must make findings, reach conclusions, and apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines to each allegation in 
an SOR,<A HREF="02-28891.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> the Judge also must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept after considering the record evidence as a whole.<A HREF="02-28891.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
Accordingly, Applicant's security eligibility does not turn on the Judge's findings and conclusions with respect to any one paragraph of the SOR in this case, 
but rather on the Judge's findings and conclusions about the overall facts and circumstances of Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  Furthermore, 
whether the record evidence shows Applicant has a net monthly remainder of $26 a month, $226 a month, or some amount in-between, there is no dispute that 
Applicant still has an unresolved medical debt of more than $20,000.  Applicant fails to articulate a persuasive argument for why there is a significant chance 
that the Judge would have reached a different result in this case if he had found Applicant had a net monthly remainder of only $26 a month.  As will be 
discussed later in this decision, the Judge had sufficient basis in the record evidence to conclude that Applicant had not demonstrated that she took reasonable 
steps to address or otherwise resolve the significant medical debt.</P> 
 
<P>(2) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the record evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that Applicant demonstrated no intention of satisfying the medical debt until her financial 
situation improved enough to accommodate the debts without sacrificing her and her husband's comfort</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge correctly noted that 
Applicant, in the August 2002 written statement, indicated she did not intend to satisfy the medical debt "until my financial situation improves enough to 
accommodate it without sacrificing our comfort," but also recognized that at the hearing Applicant had changed her attitude (Decision at p. 4).  Applicant's 
appeal brief makes an argument for how the record evidence on this aspect of the case could be interpreted in a manner more favorable to her than the 
interpretation reached by the Judge.  However, the Judge's interpretation of the record evidence is a legally permissible one that does not reflect arbitrary or 
capricious action by the Judge.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 7 ("Applicant's strong disagreement with the inferences drawn and 
conclusions reached by the Administrative Judge is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.").</P> 
 
<P>(3) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Judge erred by not applying Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6</SPAN>.<A HREF="02-28891.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In this case, the Administrative Judge had to decide whether 
Applicant took reasonable steps -- given her particular circumstances -- to deal with the unresolved medical debt.<A HREF="02-28891.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant's appeal brief makes a 
plausible argument for how the Judge could have interpreted the record evidence in a manner that could warrant the application of Financial Considerations 
itigating Condition 6.  However, given the record evidence in this case, the Judge was not compelled, logically or legally, to conclude Applicant's overall 
course of conduct in dealing with the medical debt was sufficient in timeliness or degree to warrant application of Financial Considerations Mitigating 
Condition 6.  Even if Applicant proved that she and her husband lacked financial resources to pay off the medical debt, it was not arbitrary and capricious for 
the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant failed to show reasonable efforts to explore alternative means of addressing the debt (<EM>e.g.</EM>, negotiated 
deferment or adjustment of the debt; further appeal or request for reconsideration of the insurance denial; seeking relief or review through appropriate state 
health care or insurance officials).  The Judge's choice to not apply Mitigating Condition 6 in this case was a legally permissible one.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6.  The Judge's choice is not rendered arbitrary or capricious merely because Applicant can argue for a plausible, alternate 
interpretation of the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>(4) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Judge's errors are harmful</SPAN>. For the reasons discussed above, most of Applicant's claims of error are not persuasive.  Furthermore, Applicant's 
first claim of error shows, at most, harmless error that does not warrant remand or reversal.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge 
had a rational basis for concluding that Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties raised security concerns under Guideline F.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
96-0454 (February 7, 1997) at p. 2 (discussing security concerns raised by history of financial difficulties).  Applicant had the burden of demonstrating 
explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.15.  Applicant has failed to show that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that she did not satisfy that burden of 
persuasion.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating harmful error below; therefore, for the reasons stated herein, the Administrative Judge's decision is 
affirmed. </P>
