<P>The evidence is not sufficient to prove that Applicant made deliberately false statements when he completed his security-clearance application. His  history of criminal conduct includes six arrests 
and five convictions, including two drunk driving convictions. His most recent conviction was in January 2005 for drunk driving. He was cited for an open-container offense in September 2006, 
disposition of which is pending. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns. Clearance is 
denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is challenging the Defense Department's preliminary decision to deny or revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> on 
arch 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR--which is in essence the administrative 
complaint--alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline G for excessive alcohol consumption, and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). Applicant's reply 
to the SOR was received by DOHA on April 21, 2006, and he requested a decision without a hearing. On April 28, 2006, department counsel elected to request a hearing in this case.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to me July 20, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued September 20, 2006, scheduling the hearing for October 17, 2006. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing 
took place as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript November 13, 2006. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted the criminal conduct allegations under Guideline J and the two alcohol-related incidents alleged under Guideline G. He denied, with explanation, the three 
falsification allegations under Guideline E. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. In addition, after considering the record evidence as a whole, I make the following findings of 
fact.</P> 
 
<P>1. Applicant is a 28-year-old man who is employed as an apprentice shipfitter at a shipyard for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2002. He is seeking a 
secret level security clearance for his employment.</P> 
 
<P>2. Applicant is a never-married man who has no children. He recently completed his third year of a four-year program at the shipyard's apprentice school. He plays second base on the school's 
baseball team and last year he was named an academic all-American. His grade-point average at the school is 3.6 on a 4.0 scale. In addition to apprentice school, Applicant is studying business 
administration with an on-line college.   </P> 
 
<P>3. As alleged in the SOR, Applicant has a history of criminal conduct, which he does not dispute. His several arrests and convictions are discussed below. </P> 
 
<P>4. His criminal conduct started in 1997 when he was arrested and charged with breaking and entering and larceny, a felony. The charges stemmed from an incident where he and others entered a 
college-dorm room as a prank, but it went awry. He pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and was sentenced to 45 days of confinement, 18 months probation, and a fine and costs. The felony 
larceny charge was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>5. In 1998, he was arrested and charged with possession/manufacture/distribution of marijuana and obstruction of officers. The charges stemmed from an incident where Applicant was traveling in 
his car as a passenger and a buddy was driving. Applicant was sleeping when the police made the stop. Before the stop, the buddy attempted to throw some marijuana out the car window. Although 
this was not Applicant's marijuana, he knew his buddy had the marijuana. Some of the marijuana attached itself to Applicant's bare leg and was discovered by police when Applicant exited the car. 
On or about March 2, 1999, Applicant pleaded guilty to both charges. The state court  sentenced him to 12-months probation and ordered him to pay a fine and various fees on the marijuana 
offense. He received a similar sentence for the other offense. </P> 
 
<P>6. On or about March 30, 1999, Applicant was charged with second-degree forgery, a felony. </P> 
 
<P>The charge stemmed from an incident where Applicant was with the same buddy when the buddy planned to pass a forged check to a bank. Applicant drove his buddy to the bank knowing his 
buddy intended to pass the forged check. Otherwise, he had nothing to do with the forgery. Subsequently, the local district attorney dismissed the charge against Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>7. Applicant was arrested again in November 2000, and he was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and driving with a suspended or revoked license. The two offenses were disposed of 
in municipal court when he was convicted of both in January 2001. For the DUI offense, the court sentenced him to 1 day of confinement, 11 months and 29 days of probation, and ordered him to 
pay a $750 fine. For the other offense, he was ordered to serve 12-months probation and pay a $650 fine.</P> 
 
<P>8. While still on probation, he was arrested in November 2001 and charged with driving with a suspended or revoked driver's license. In January 2002, the same municipal court convicted him as 
charged. The court sentenced him to serve 12-months probation, to pay a fine of $1,250, and to perform community service.</P> 
 
<P>9.  Applicant was arrested for his second DUI offense in November 2004. He was convicted in state court in January 2005. The court sentenced him to serve 90 days in jail, but suspended 85 days.</P> 
 
<P>10. More recently in September 2006, Applicant was stopped by police for speeding. During the stop, police discovered Applicant had an open container of alcohol in his vehicle and he was 
charged or cited accordingly. The charge stemmed from an incident where Applicant took the alcohol away from a person who was abusing it and then drove off. He had not drunk any alcohol 
before driving; indeed, he passed a field sobriety test. These matters were still pending disposition at the time of the hearing. In addition to this incident, Applicant does not have a current driver's 
license issued by his state of residence. His license was suspended due to a mixup resulting in his auto insurance lapsing. </P> 
 
<P>11. To obtain a security clearance, Applicant completed a security-clearance application in July 2004. Applicant was given a worksheet or hard copy of the form and told to complete it in a couple 
of weeks or so. He procrastinated and then completed it in a rush when told he would be sent home from work if it was not completed. Thereafter, he reviewed the draft, provided some additional 
information in response to questions, and signed the finished product (Exhibit 1). In signing it, he certified that his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief 
and made in good faith. Also, he certified that he understood that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both under federal law.</P> 
 
<P>12. In completing the security-clearance application, he answered several questions about his police record. In response to Question 21<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> addressing felony charges or convictions, he disclosed being 
charged with second-degree forgery as discussed above. He did not disclose that he was charged with the felony offense of larceny as discussed above.  </P> 
 
<P>13. In response to Question 24<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> addressing charges or convictions for alcohol- or drug-related offenses, he disclosed his marijuana offense discussed above. He did not disclose the November 2000 
DUI offense as discussed above. In addition to disclosing the marijuana offense, Applicant provided some explanatory remarks about the incident. He said that the marijuana found on his leg did not 
belong to him, but belonged to his buddy who was driving the vehicle. </P> 
 
<P>14. In his reply to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally or deliberately falsifying his responses to Questions 21 and 24. Concerning his remarks for Question 24, he explained that the marijuana 
was not his marijuana and that is why he said what he said. In his hearing testimony, Applicant, in essence, stood by his denials and his explanations.</P> 
 
<P>15. In addition to his affirmative responses to Questions 21 and 24, Applicant disclosed other adverse information. He disclosed a driving with a suspended license offense in response to Question 
26. Also, he disclosed a delinquent telephone account in response to Questions 38 and 39 addressing financial delinquencies.  </P>

<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for 
each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria 
and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to 
have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination of an 
applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> There is no presumption

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>1. The Criminal Conduct Security Concern </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J,<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> criminal conduct is a concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A history of illegal 
behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised under Guideline J. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history or pattern of criminal conduct based on his multiple 
arrests and convictions starting in 1997 through 2005. In short, he was convicted of breaking and entering in 1997, the marijuana offense in 1999, the first DUI offense in 2001, driving with a 
suspended or revoked license in 2002, and the second DUI offense in 2005. Although none of these convictions involved crimes of violence, personal injury, or loss or damage to property, his 
convictions reflect a pattern of questionable judgment. Given these facts and circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude none apply. In particular, his second DUI offense in November 2004, adjudicated in January 2005, is too close in time for his criminal conduct 
to be considered not recent within the meaning of the guideline.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> In addition, there is not clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant has been arrested six times and convicted five 
times within the last ten years. His police record includes two alcohol-related offenses (the DUIs) and being at the wrong place or with the wrong people at the wrong time (the marijuana and 
forgery charges). Taken together, these matters constitute a pattern of criminal conduct and questionable judgment that appears to be ongoing as evidenced by the open-container offense in 
September 2006. At this point, it is too soon to tell if Applicant can establish a track record as a law-abiding citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2. The Alcohol Consumption Security Concern</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline G,<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> a history of excessive alcohol consumption raises a security concern because of the potential for deliberate or inadvertent  mishandling of classified information due to 
intoxication. The concern is that excessive consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline G. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption as 
evidenced by his two DUI convictions. His DUI convictions are of special concern because his repetitive conduct indicates a tendency toward reckless behavior or an unwillingness to comply with 
the law. Given the facts here,  DC 1<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>--alcohol-related incidents away from work--applies against Applicant. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude none apply. Applicant has not presented a persuasive case that his alcohol-related incidents are a thing of the past. Indeed, his second DUI 
offense took place in November 2004, which is relatively recent. At this point, it is too soon to tell if Applicant can establish a track record of responsible alcohol use with no further alcohol-related 
incidents. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>3. The Personal Conduct Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question: Does a person's past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security 
clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. </P> 
 
<P>An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the 
information did not need to be reported. </P> 
 
<P>To prove the falsification allegations, the government offered a single exhibit (the security-clearance application) and relied on its cross-examination of Applicant. Although substantial evidence is a 
low standard, the evidence here is skimpy and insufficient to prove that Applicant made deliberately false statements when completing his security-clearance application. First, I am not persuaded 
that Applicant gave deliberately false answers to Questions 21 and 24. His disclosures of adverse information in response to Questions 21, 24, 26, 38, and 39 undermines the government's case that 
Applicant was trying to deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts on his security-clearance application. Second, although Applicant was certainly in constructive possession of 
marijuana when the police stopped the car, the unrebutted evidence is that the marijuana belonged to the driver, not Applicant. Given these facts, I am not persuaded that Applicant's explanatory 
remarks to Question 24 were deliberately false. Indeed, a reasonable person in the same or similar situation could honesty believe as Applicant did--that the marijuana was not his, at least as far as 
ownership was concerned.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG>4. The Whole-Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have also considered the available information in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is now a 28-year-old man and was an adult when his criminal activity took place.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> His last 
conviction was his second DUI offense in January 2005, and his September 2006 open-container offense is pending. His history of criminal conduct and alcohol-related offenses appear to be a 
tendency to use questionable judgment that is likely to continue.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Also, he did not present a persuasive case that his criminal conduct and alcohol-related offenses are behind him and what steps he 
is taking to accomplish this.<A HREF="06-02163.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> His tendency to exercise questionable judgment is enough to have serious doubt about his suitability to handle and safeguard classified information. Although it 
appears he is doing well as an apprentice shipfitter attending apprentice school, those matters are not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. </P> 
 
<P>Considering the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption security 
concerns. Therefore, Guidelines J and G are decided against Applicant. Based on lack of proof, the falsification allegations and Guideline E are decided for Applicant. To conclude, Applicant  has 
not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </P>
