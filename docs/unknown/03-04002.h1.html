<P>Applicant was convicted of three specifications of distribution of methamphetamine and one specification of attempt to distribute methamphetamine while on 
active duty in the U.S. Army in 1983. He was sentenced to serve one year confinement, reduced to paygrade E-1, forfeited all pay and allowances, and was 
separated from the Army with a dishonorable discharge. Although he would otherwise be able to mitigate the security concern created by his criminal conduct, 
he is prohibited from doing so because of the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct. The SOR also alleges that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies Applicant from having a security 
clearance granted or renewed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on July 12, 2004, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted the SOR allegation 
concerning his criminal conduct and the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to his case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 15, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on October 21, 2004, scheduling the hearing for November 10, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, called two witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted 28 documentary exhibits that 
were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-28, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on November 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Following the hearing in this case, a moratorium was imposed by DOHA on the issuance of all decisions in cases involving 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1) and (4) that 
necessitated the extended delay in the issuance of this decision. The moratorium has now been lifted.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 54 years old, has been married since April 1973, and has two sons, ages 30 and 26. He has been employed as an engineering technician for a 
defense contractor since May 2001. He was previously employed as a calibration technician from February 1998 to October 1998, by a different employer as a 
calibration technician from October 1998 October 2000, and by a third employer as a maintenance technician from October 2000 to April 2001. The testimony 
of his witnesses, performance appraisals, photograph, newspaper article, and award certificates he submitted attest to his reputation as an excellent employee 
and involved community member. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1971 to July 1978, attained the rank of specialist five, earned three good conduct medals, and was 
discharged with an honorable discharge. Applicant reenlisted in the Army in June 1981 as a specialist four, performed his assigned duties admirably, and 
attained the rank of specialist six before he was dishonorably discharged in December 1983. He was awarded an Army Achievement Medal in recognition of his 
meritorious service in October 1982.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1983, while stationed in a foreign country, Applicant thrice purchased methamphetamine from a foreign national and resold it to a fellow soldier. The total 
weight of the controlled substance he purchased and resold was 1.315 grams, and the cost to him was $260.00. The  soldier to whom the drugs were sold was 
working as a confidential source for Army criminal investigators and persuaded Applicant to buy the drugs for him, apparently based upon Applicant's fluency 
in the language of the country in which he was stationed. Although Applicant experimented with marijuana on one occasion while in high school and a second 
time while in the Army, he did not use any of the methamphetamine he purchased for resale.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on June 3, 1983, and charged with three specifications of distribution of methamphetamine, three specifications of possession of 
methamphetamine, one specification of attempt to distribute methamphetamine, one specification of attempt to possess methamphetamine, one specification of 
failure to obey a lawful general regulation by possessing a straw containing methamphetamine, and one specification of larceny. In December 1983, Applicant 
pled to and was found guilty of three specifications of distribution of methamphetamine (the distributions occurring on May 3, 1983, May 25, 1983, and June 3, 
1983), and one specification of attempt to distribute methamphetamine (the attempt occurring on  June 3, 1983). He was found not guilty of the remaining 
charges. He was sentenced to be confined for one year, to be reduced to paygrade E-1, to forfeit all pay and allowances, and to be separated from the army with 
a dishonorable discharge. He was released from confinement on September 14, 1984, having served just over nine months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's only other reported offense was a speeding ticket he received in 1969. He failed to appear in court on the scheduled trial date and a warrant was 
issued for his arrest. He was arrested on that warrant sometime around 1969, held in jail for a week, and the charge was ultimately dismissed. He has no 
criminal history subsequent to his release from military confinement in 1984.      </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. In 1983 he was convicted of distributing methamphetamine three times and 
attempting to distribute it one  time. He was sentenced to serve one year confinement and was discharged from the Army with a dishonorable discharge. 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under 
dishonorable conditions </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not been arrested or charged with any offense since his 1983 conviction. Additionally, the testimony of his character witnesses, his employment 
records, community involvement, and  steady work and family history attest to Applicant's rehabilitation and the unlikelihood that any similar conduct will ever 
again occur. I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM> 
and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>applicable. Applicant would be able to mitigate the security concern that arises from his 1983 
criminal conviction but for the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.<A HREF="03-04002.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Guideline J is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 2000, a federal statute was enacted that prohibited the Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance for any applicant who had 
been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (c)(4) (2001). "In a meritorious case," the Secretary of 
Defense could authorize an exception to the prohibition. The Secretary was not authorized to delegate that authority. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(d) (2001). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In June 2001, 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing guidance for processing cases under the statute. In response, the Director, DOHA, directed that, in cases 
in which the decision to deny or revoke a security clearance is based solely on 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge "shall include without explanation" a 
statement recommending or not recommending further consideration of the case for a waiver of the prohibition. DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64 &para; 3.e (Jul. 
10, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The waiver provision was amended in 2004. It now provides that an exception to the prohibition on granting a clearance may be authorized "[i]n a meritorious 
case, . . . if there are mitigating factors. Any such waiver may be authorized only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the 
authority of, an Executive order or other guidance issued by the President." 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(d) (2004). No such executive order or other guidance has been 
issued by, or under the authority of, the President.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Notwithstanding the Director's direction in DOHA Operating Instruction 64 that the administrative judge </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">make a recommendation whether the statute's 
prohibitions should be waived, the Appeal Board has concluded that, under the 2004 amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge has </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">no authority to make a waiver recommendation. According to [the amendments], any waiver decision 'may be authorized only in accordance with standards and 
procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance issued by the President.' Without such standards and procedures, the 
Judge had no legal authority to make any recommendation, favorable or unfavorable, concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ISCR Case No. 03-05804 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2005).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Appeal Board has conflated making a recommendation to waive with making a decision to waive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The amendment limits the authority to grant a waiver, 
not to recommend whether a waiver should or should not be granted. Nevertheless, I am not at liberty to disregard the Appeal Board's decision even though I 
disagree with it. ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2004). However, to avoid the possibility of a remand when/if guidance is later issued by or 
under the authority of the President, I believe it is appropriate to note what my recommendation would have been had I the authority to make one. Recognizing 
my recommendation is not binding on the waiver authority, I would recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
