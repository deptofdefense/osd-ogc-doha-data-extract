</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old married man self-employed as a small-business owner of a trucking company. He and his spouse owe more than $90,000 in unpaid 
federal income taxes for several recent tax years. The record evidence is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from a 
delinquent tax debt of such magnitude. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 9, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR advised Applicant that 
DOHA was unable to find--as required under Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On May 21, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a clearance decision 
based on a hearing record.</P> 
<P>DOHA assigned the case to me on July 1, 2002. Thereafter, on July 15<SUP>th</SUP> a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for July 30, 2002. </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel presented 13 documentary exhibits that were admitted without objections; no witnesses were called. Applicant presented 
seven documentary exhibits that were admitted without objections; he testified on his own behalf as did his spouse. I received the hearing transcript on August 
22, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>This case involved a joint hearing with Applicant and his spouse, also an applicant for a security clearance. On July 9, 2002, I held a pre-hearing conference and 
raised the idea of conducting a joint hearing because the applicants are married to each other, the SORs are nearly identical, the applicants' answers to the SORs 
are nearly identical, and the cases appear factually intertwined. Neither Department Counsel nor Applicant raised an objection or voiced a concern about a joint 
hearing. At the hearing, I discussed this matter with the parties, gave a more formal instruction on the nature of a joint hearing, and the parties again did not 
raise any objections.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k.; he denied the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.d., 
and 3.a. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions into the findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 42-year-old married man self-employed as a farmer and a small-business owner of a trucking company. He is seeking access to classified 
information so the trucking company can haul loads involving the defense industry. His spouse, although not technically an employee or officer of the 
corporation, is involved in the day-to-day operations of the trucking company by handing the numerous administrative tasks and obligations involved in running 
a small business.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant graduated high school in 1978 and started the trucking company in 1982. He married his spouse in 1989, and the marriage has produced two children, 
a daughter born in 1994 and a son in 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR &para; 1 alleges Applicant is delinquent on both local and federal taxes. Specifically, the SOR alleges four municipal fire protection liens were filed against 
Applicant for about $410. The delinquent debt to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is based on personal income taxes for more than $99,000 for tax years 
1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2000. Due to the unpaid taxes, the IRS  filed three federal tax liens against all property and rights to property belonging to 
Applicant, plus additional penalties, interest, and costs. SOR &para; 2 alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his security-clearance application (SF 86)<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> when 
responding to four different questions concerning his financial record and delinquencies. And SOR &para; 3 alleges criminal conduct based on the alleged 
falsifications of his security-clearance application. Applicant admits to the tax delinquencies, but denies the falsification allegations and the related criminal 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In May 2001, Applicant completed his SF 86. In response to Question 36 concerning tax liens within the last seven years, Applicant answered "yes" disclosing 
a federal tax lien for $400 filed against him in 1995. In response to Question 37, he answered "no" thereby denying any unpaid judgments against him in the last 
seven years. In response to Question 38 concerning debts more than 180-days delinquent within the last seven years, Applicant answered "yes" disclosing a 
federal income tax delinquency for $5000 incurred in 1995. And in response to Question 39 concerning debts currently more than 90-days delinquent, 
Applicant answered "no."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In December 2001, Applicant and his spouse were both interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). The interview produced a written 
statement,<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> dated December 17</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP>,  wherein Applicant detailed his knowledge of the tax liens and unpaid taxes. Applicant also denied any intent to deliberately 
provide false or misleading information on his SF 86. In his statement, Applicant mentioned an initial interview in August 2001 where he and his spouse 
speculated they owed the IRS about $28,000. They suggested the DSS agent contact their attorney who was handling their tax problems and had all the relevant 
documents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant and his spouse were interviewed in October 2001 and learned from the agent that they owed about $91,000 to the IRS. On December 12</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> the 
applicants were interviewed for the third time by the same DSS agent. During this interview the applicants learned they owed taxes for tax year 2000, and they 
also learned about the four municipal fire liens. The applicants were interviewed for the fourth and last time on December 17</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> where they were informed they 
owed the IRS about $96,000 plus an additional $3,900 or so the tax year 2000. Applicant acknowledged responsibility for all the tax delinquencies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his statement, Applicant also discussed the circumstances surrounding the judgment taken against the trucking company in 1997 for about $34,000. The 
judgment was unpaid when the SF 86 was submitted, but satisfied a few months later in October 2001. The lawsuit and judgment were against the trucking 
company for fuel expenses; Applicant and his spouse were not sued in their personal capacity.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statement to the DSS included a personal financial statement current as of December 17</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP>. While the financial statement suggests that Applicant's 
monthly expenses exceed his monthly income, the statement is not a true picture of the couple's financial situation because it is merely a snapshot that reflects 
the cyclical nature of the trucking business. Applicant and his spouse credibly explained the circumstances and, aside from the outstanding tax debt, they are 
otherwise living within their means.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the hearing, Applicant's spouse testified about the circumstances surrounding the completion of their security-clearance applications. Applicant's spouse 
took charge of ensuring that the  SF 86s were completed and submitted to the DSS. She was working to meet a self-imposed deadline to submit their SF 86s, 
along with SF 86s from five employees, within a few days so the DSS would conduct the background investigations. If submitted later, she understood their 
background investigations would be handled by another entity, resulting in delay. This deadline resulted in a rushed atmosphere. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's spouse also encountered some difficulties in the completing the forms further complicating the situation. The result was she completed SF 86 
worksheets<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for Applicant and herself. The five employees each completed a worksheet. Applicant's spouse points out the worksheet only contains one entry 
for Questions 36, 37, 38, and 39. In other words, the form does not have space for two or more entries in response to these questions. And as a result, 
Applicant's spouse responded with a single entry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Due to the time crunch, Applicant's spouse delegated the task of entering the worksheet information into the SF 86 software program to an office clerk. 
Because the clerk entered the information, Applicant's spouse did not know the software program allowed for additional entries to the pertinent questions. Once 
the clerk completed the task, Applicant's spouse completed the process by having Applicant review it, a rather quick process, and sign it. She then had the SF 
86s delivered to the DSS.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At present, the 1994 federal income tax debt is paid.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> In addition, the municipal fire protection liens were paid in June 2002, and the liens were released.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
Remaining is more than $90,000 owed to the IRS for the other tax years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The couple's federal income tax problems can be traced to tax year 1995 when they were hit with a large (more than $30,000) and an unexpected tax bill. The 
$30,000 tax debt mushroomed or snowballed resulting in unpaid taxes for several subsequent years. The initial problem resulted from operating the trucking 
company as a sole proprietorship as opposed to a corporation. A previous accountant had advised that incorporating was not the best method to operate the 
company. This proved to be unwise advice when the trucking company's annual gross income grew, which, in turn, resulted in higher federal income taxes. The 
trucking company has since incorporated as an S corporation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant and his spouse have made some efforts over the years to resolve the tax problem with the IRS, including making some irregular payments. The efforts 
to compromise with the IRS have been unsuccessful, however, no doubt because the IRS is well-secured on real property valued in excess of the tax debt. The 
couple's recent effort to resolve the matter is to obtain a bank loan.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The loan proceeds would be used to pay off the IRS debt, and the bank would take a 
mortgage against the property. Applicant believes the loan will be approved, although that has not yet occurred. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the record evidence as a whole, I specifically make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<OL> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant owes the IRS for unpaid federal income taxes more than $90,000 for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2000.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's answers to Questions 36, 38, and 39 of his SF 86 were not deliberately false, nor was it a deliberate attempt to provide incomplete or misleading 
information.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's "no" answer to Question 37 was correct as the unpaid $34,000 judgment was taken against the trucking company, not Applicant or his spouse. </SPAN></LI>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and

relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in security clearance cases 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> establishing a substantial-evidence standard.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically may exist for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, careless, or negligent in their obligation to 
properly safeguard and handle classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, based on the record as a whole, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial 
obligations as well as  inability or unwillingness to satisfy his just debts. Unpaid federal income taxes, more than $90,000 over several recent tax years, support 
these conclusions. Applicant is not an illegal tax protestor and he acknowledges responsibility for the unpaid taxes. But that does not mean a tax debt of this 
magnitude is not a security concern. It is, notwithstanding Applicant's best intentions. In other words, a person who is unable or unwilling to fulfill their 
financial obligation to pay federal income taxes--as required by law--creates a reasonable doubt about that person's fitness or suitability for access to classified 
information. The record evidence shows that is the situation here. Indeed, I cannot reconcile the situation where an applicant with a history of not paying their 
share of federal income taxes is nonetheless asking that the federal government grant them the privilege of access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline F and conclude none apply. In particular, MC 6<A HREF="02-05585.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> does not apply because Applicant's irregular 
efforts over the years to resolve the federal income tax debt cannot be viewed as good-faith efforts. In addition, although Applicant  is trying to obtain a loan to 
pay off the IRS, I cannot give this information much weight because it is a future event that may or may not happen. Until the delinquent federal income taxes 
are paid, Applicant and his spouse agree with the IRS on a realistic payment schedule, or another solution is found, the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
of the problem remains most probable. The record evidence is insufficient, at this time, to mitigate or extenuate the security concern raised by Applicant's 
unpaid federal income taxes totaling more than $90,000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, Guideline F is resolved against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG> </STRONG>key question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can 
be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, the totality of facts and circumstances do not convince me that Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed information about his financial history on his 
SF 86. Instead, I conclude Applicant had very little to do with completing his security-clearance application. Other than reviewing the SF 86 for a few minutes 
and signing it, Applicant's spouse took responsibility for the task. And he reasonably relied on her to accurately complete the SF 86. Unfortunately, her 
efforts--while working under time pressures with incomplete information--were in err and less than perfect. Although Applicant certainly adopted the answers 
when he signed the SF 86, he was not deliberately attempting to mislead, nor was he trying to omit or conceal his financial history. Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, including that some derogatory financial information was disclosed in the SF 86, my commonsense conclusion is Applicant's answers to 
Questions 36, 38, and 39 were mistaken, but not deliberately false. Accordingly, Guideline E is resolved in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Using the same reasoning, the Government has not established Applicant violated Title 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, the federal crime of making a false statement to a 
governmental agency. Accordingly, Guideline J is resolved in Applicant's favor. </SPAN></P>
