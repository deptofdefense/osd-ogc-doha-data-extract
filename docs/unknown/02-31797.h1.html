<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has relatives who are citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant's husband and two sons are also dual 
citizens of the United States and Iran. Although she has been a U.S. citizen since August 1991, Applicant applied for an Iranian passport in September 1998 that 
did not expire until September 2003, used that passport for travel to Iran in February 2002, and has not presented any evidence to indicate she has surrendered 
the Iranian passport. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns of foreign preference and influence that are present in this case. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference). Applicant submitted a sworn response to the SOR, dated 
August 5, 2003, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing. Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR, 
although she averred that her half-brother, who was included in SOR subparagraph 2.b., is now deceased.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 18, 2003, that was mailed to Applicant January 5, 2004. Applicant did not 
object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for consideration within the 30-day time period provided to her. The case was 
assigned to me on March 8, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, a 52-year-old woman, has been employed by a U.S. company since July 1985, presently as an engineering group manager. She has also worked as a 
consultant for a U.S. organization since February 1999. She has been married to the same man since September 1972, and has two adult sons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was born and raised in Iran. She married her husband, an Iranian citizen, in Iran in September 1972. She obtained a PH. D from a university in the 
United Kingdom in 1979, and then returned to Iran where she worked as an assistant professor at an Iranian  university from February 1980 to May 1981. Her 
oldest son was born in the U.K. while she and her husband were attending the university there. Her second son was born in Iran. The entire family immigrated 
to the United States, via Turkey, in approximately December 1981, and became naturalized U.S. citizens on August 5, 1991. Applicant was issued a U.S. 
passport on January 10, 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iran. Her mother is 78 years old. One of her sisters is a retired teacher.  The other two sisters 
have been housewives their entire lives. Applicant had one half-brother, a medical officer retired from the Iranian military, who is now deceased. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant obtained an Iranian passport on September 29, 1998 that did not expire until September 28, 2003. She used that passport for travel to Iran from 
February 26, 2002 to March 7, 2002 to vacation and visit relatives. Applicant and her husband and children are all considered Iranian nationals by the Iranian 
government, and are required by Iran to possess an Iranian passport if they travel to that country. Applicant provided a statement on July 31, 2002 in which she 
declared: "I have to hold my Iranian passport because that is required when I visit my family. Therefore, I cannot renounce that. You cannot renounce that, it is 
automatic." She has not supplied any information to indicate she has surrendered the Iranian passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's employment has in the past required occasional foreign travel. She has traveled to India, Brazil, the U.K., Amsterdam, Italy, and the People's 
Republic of China (on three occasions between December 2000 and July 2001) on business trips normally of three to ten days duration. She has also engaged in 
leisure travel to Mexico and Canada. She apparently has used her U.S. passport for all travel, other than to Iran, although the passport copies in the FORM are 
difficult to read.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B, 
pertaining to foreign influence, and Guideline C, pertaining to foreign preference, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN>.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone 
to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's business travel on behalf of her U.S. employer, even to the People's Republic of China, does not in and of itself demonstrate a foreign preference or 
raise any security concern.  However, DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM> is one of those acts that demonstrate a foreign preference.  Applicant obtained and 
used an Iranian passport after she became a United States citizen to visit her relatives in 2002. That action is an exercise of dual citizenship. Her statement 
makes clear she contemplates future travel to Iran, and the use of an Iranian passport. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Further, there is no evidence Applicant has surrendered the passport, even if she did not renew it when it expired in 2003. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ASD(C3I) Memorandum, dated 
August 16, 2000 (the Money Memo)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">mandates that, "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the 
applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government." The DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that "merely keeping a foreign passport until it expires does not satisfy the requirement in the ASDC3I memo."<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, 
Guideline C is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>.  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon the allegations in the SOR, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM> must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B. Her employment as an assistant professor at an Iranian university 
from February 1980 to May 1981 does not raise any additional security concern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1 applies in this case because Applicant's husband is a dual citizen of Iran, and her mother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iran. The SOR did 
not allege any concern about the dual citizenship of Applicant's children, or about her in-laws who apparently are also citizens and residents of Iran, and those 
relationships will not be considered in arriving at a decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Further, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating 
conditions, and an Administrative Judge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not 
present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following information about Iran and its relations with the United States is significant in determining whether a security concern exists under the known 
facts in this case: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (RGC) and Ministry or Intelligence and Security 
(MOIS) continued to be involved in the planning and support of terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use terrorism to pursue their goals.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Large-scale demonstrations have taken place in various regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a result of a sometimes volatile political climate. 
U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Warning against such travel should exercise caution throughout the country. . . .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal 
possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. . . . Tensions generated by the current situation in Iraq have 
increased the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests abroad posed by those who oppose U.S. policy. Some elements of the Iranian government and 
population remain hostile to the U.S.. . . . U.S. citizens who go to Iran should exercise caution. . . . U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to 
be Iranian citizens have been detained and harassed by Iranian authorities.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B: MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign 
citizens are casual and infrequent.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The hostility of Iran to the United States places a heavy burden upon Applicant to demonstrate that her family ties with relatives living in Iran do not pose a 
security risk.<A HREF="02-31797.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant has failed to provide any information upon which such a finding could be based. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against 
Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P>
