<P>Applicant had financial difficulties for a number of years. Most of her past overdue debts arose during a period when she could not obtain employment. Since 
she has become employed, she has resolved all of her past due accounts, and she is now current with every creditor.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is

</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On July 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>August 1, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She requested a clearance decision based on the 
written record, but she subsequently requested a decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on February 3, 2004, because of geographic consideration, the case was reassigned to this 
Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on February 14, 2004, and the hearing 
was held on March 17, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 7), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 
eleven documentary exhibits (Applicant Exhibits A through K) and offered her own testimony.  The transcript (TR) was received on March 31, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains three allegations, 1.a. through 1.c., under Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a and 1.c. The admitted allegations are incorporated 
herein as a finding of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 31 year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN> She is unmarried and she has two sons, ages fifteen and 
nine. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 2000.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> lists two debts that Applicant owed as of June 19, 2003, 1.a. and 1.b. under Adjudicative Guideline F.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts will be discussed in the order that 
they were listed in the SOR:    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. This debt, to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for a credit card, is listed in the SOR in the amount of $3,793. The evidence at the hearing established that the correct amount owed 
was $3,164.  Applicant testified that she made payments of $50 a month for eighteen months, and then she made a final payment of $1,100 on December 12, 
2003 </SPAN>(TR at 26-28). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Exhibits J and K </SPAN>establish that, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as of December 12, 2003, this debt was satisfied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. This debt, to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for a credit card, is in the amount of $3,793. Applicant testified that she made a payment of $1,000 on this debt. She contended that 
the creditor agreed upon this as  full payment, and the debt was completely resolved as of December 17, 2001  (TR at 28-30).  Exhibit C, a letter from the 
collection agency for Creditor 2, verifies this debt has been paid. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant </SPAN>was interviewed by Defense Security Service in December 2001, she had at least 10 debts that were overdue. She had already begun to make 
payments on some of these debts before her interview .  Based on the evidence introduced at the hearing, I conclude that Applicant has now resolved all but one 
of her debts, a consolidated debt for her college loans, and that she is now current on that debt. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>'s financial problems began when she was a full time student and the sole provider of two young children. They continued after she graduated from 
college, when for the next two years, despite her best efforts, she was unemployed or underemployed. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consulted a credit counseling service, but she 
determined that she could perform the services that it would provide herself. Once she was able to obtain full time employment, she began to contact each 
creditor and make restitution for each debt (TR at 40, 41)</SPAN>.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> now is living in a fiscally responsible manner. She only has one credit card, and she is current on all of her debts. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She introduced two positive letters 
of reference indicating that she is a trustworthy, responsible and hard working individual. (Exhibit I) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following guideline and concern most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. However, she has made excellent 
progress and has now resolved all of her past due debts.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN>under Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude that DC E2.A6.1.2.1. applies because of Applicant's history of not meeting her 
financial obligations. I find that Mitigating Condition (MC)  E2.A6.1.3.3. applies because the cause of Applicant's financial difficulties were largely as a result 
of a situation beyond her control, her unemployment. MC E2.A6.1.3.6. is also applicable since Applicant has resolved all of her past due debts and is now 
current with every creditor.  </SPAN>I, therefore,  resolve Guideline F for Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
