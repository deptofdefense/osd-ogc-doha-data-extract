<P>Applicant has a history of late payment of his financial obligations, due in part to financial mismanagement. Several tax liens were filed against his property for 
failure to pay his real estate taxes on time between April 1997 and May 2003, although the liens were released after he satisfied the taxes. As a result of being 
laid off from his job with a defense contractor in February 2005, Applicant was behind about $3,000 to $4,000 in paying his utility costs and property taxes as 
of August 2005. Despite recent efforts to reduce unnecessary expenses, financial considerations concerns persist. Personal conduct remains of concern as well 
because he did not disclose his delinquent debts or his tax liens on his security clearance application. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 13, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="04-05196.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Specifically, the government alleged 
Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $7,944 to seven creditors and his expenses exceed his income, and he falsified his April 2003 security clearance 
application (SF 86) by denying any liens had been filed against his property and that he had debt more than 180 days delinquent in the last seven years.</P> 
<P>On February 8, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 8, 2005. On July 20, 2005, I scheduled a 
hearing for August 10, 2005. At the hearing, an initial question was raised as to DOHA's jurisdiction, as Applicant had been terminated from his employment 
with the defense contractor on February 18, 2005, for lack of work in his area that did not require a clearance. Jurisdiction was accepted based on assurances 
that Applicant is subject to recall to his job by the defense contractor if his clearance issue is adjudicated favorably and the hearing proceeded to its conclusion. 
The government entered seven exhibits and Applicant one exhibit. Applicant testified as reflected in a transcript received on August 26, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In his Answer, the Applicant admitted owing only two of the alleged debts (SOR &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d.), and that his expenses exceed his income. Applicant denied 
the remaining debts as well as any deliberate falsification of his April 2003 security clearance application. Applicant's admissions are accepted and 
incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old married father of two children (daughters born in 1987 and 1990) who was employed by a defense contractor (company X) from 
April 2003 to February 2005 when his interim secret-level clearance was withdrawn and he was laid off due to lack of a clearance. He is subject to recall by 
company X should his clearance be adjudicated favorably.</P> 
<P>Applicant worked for company X previously from 1982 to May 1988 at an hourly rate that eventually rose to $12.02. He held a confidential security clearance, 
which was granted to him in June 1982. From 1988 to about 1991, he was employed as a machinist for another company at $11.50 an hour. After the business 
went bankrupt, Applicant was out of work for five months until he was hired on in May 1991 at a new company started by the owners of the bankrupt business. 
He was paid about $14.20 an hour as a machinist. From about 1988 to 1998, Applicant's spouse owned and operated a small restaurant with her mother that 
was open only for lunch. They did not realize any significant income  from the business although it paid for itself.</P> 
<P>Neither Applicant nor his spouse was good at budgeting their expenses or paying bills and at times they spent money foolishly. They began to fall behind in 
paying their mortgage, property taxes, and medical bills, starting in the mid-1990s. Current in their mortgage loan of $73,677 taken out in November 1992, 
Applicant and his spouse refinanced with the same lender in February 1994, taking out a new 15-year loan of $86,919. In March 1995, they took out a second 
mortgage (SOR &para; 1.b.). Even though Applicant had started working as a computer-aided design draftsman at $16.28 per hour in February 1997, an increase over 
what he had been earning, they were late in paying their second mortgage as well as their property taxes. Tax liens were filed against Applicant in the amounts 
of $702 in April 1996, $743 in April 1997, and $875 in April 1998.</P> 
<P>In 1998, Applicant's spouse went to work as a cook for the local school system. In September 1998, Applicant and his spouse refinanced their mortgage with a 
loan of $96,000 held by a new lender. In lieu of defaulting on their second mortgage, on which was owed about $10,000, the creditor agreed to take a lesser 
amount in a payoff. The $6,078 balance of the loan was listed as a charge off for accounting purposes. Applicant denies owing the debt and collection is not 
being pursued by the creditor. The delinquent real estate taxes on his home were satisfied in the refinancing, and the liens were released in October 1998.</P> 
<P>In February 1999, a local hospital obtained a judgment against Applicant in the amount of  $292. In April 1999, the town filed another lien, this time in the 
amount of $452, for failure to pay real estate taxes. In September 1999, a credit card debt delinquency was settled for less than the full balance. Applicant and 
his spouse were also thirty days late several times on their $890 monthly mortgage payment. In November 1999, Applicant took out a second mortgage of 
$11,797, to be repaid at $159 per month. He fell behind as many as 120 days on the loan. In May 2000, a tax lien of $919 was filed against Applicant because of 
past due real estate taxes on his home. The April 1999 and May 2000 tax liens were released on payment in August 2000. From September 2000 to February 
2001, Applicant worked part-time for a hardware retailer to make extra money to pay  household expenses, including the second mortgage.</P> 
<P>Applicant was also unable to pay the balance of his gas bill, and it reached a high of $4,082. He paid whatever he could afford, usually between $125 and $150 
monthly toward the balance, which was acceptable to the utility service provider, and had reduced the balance to $1,003 as of January 2003 (SOR &para; 1.g.). 
Applicant again failed to pay his real estate taxes on time, and in May 2002 a tax lien was filed against him in the amount of $1,023.</P> 
<P>In July 2002, Applicant and his spouse refinanced their mortgage with their current mortgagor, taking out a new loan of $121,000, to be repaid at $1,156 
monthly. The outstanding real estate taxes were paid in or before December 2002, and the lien was released. In August 2002, Applicant satisfied the $292 
hospital judgment, but another medical provider placed a $337 delinquent debt for collection in October 2002 (SOR &para;1.d.). In February 2003, the hospital 
obtained a second judgment against Applicant, this one for $257, that he paid in June 2003. </P> 
<P>Applicant returned to work for company X as a first class machinist in about March 2003.<A HREF="04-05196.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Needing a security clearance for his duties, Applicant executed a 
security clearance application (SF 86) on March 27, 2003. He responded negatively to whether in the last seven years he had any financial judgments filed 
against him that had not been paid (not alleged), any liens placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts (SOR &para; 2.a.), or any debts 
delinquent more than 180 days (SOR &para; 2.b.). An electronic version of the form was subsequently prepared and submitted on April 1, 2003. Applicant did not 
change his responses to the financial inquiries before the form was submitted to the government.<A HREF="04-05196.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> A check of Applicant's credit on April 2, 2003, revealed the 
settled second mortgage (&para;1.b.) as a charged off balance of $6,078, the $337 medical bill in collection (&para; 1.d.), and the tax liens released with the exception of 
the May 2002 lien of $1,023. No outstanding credit card delinquencies were reported by the credit bureaus.</P> 
<P>In December 2002, the $1,023 tax lien against his property was released. Sometime in April 2003, an outstanding dental debt of $763, on which there had been 
no activity since August 2002, was placed for collection (&para; 1.c.). Applicant again failed to pay his real estate taxes on time and in May 2003, a $558 lien was 
filed by the town against his property. In June 2003, Applicant satisfied the $257 hospital judgment. In September 2003, Applicant and his spouse financed a 
vehicle for her, taking out a loan of $16,087 to be repaid at $382 monthly while the medical debts in &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d. went unpaid. That same month, 
Applicant's former employer obtained a $686 judgment against Applicant in a dispute with him over payment for vacation time. A check of Applicant's credit 
on February 2, 2004, revealed the medical debts (&para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d.) as still outstanding, but Applicant had through payments reduced the balance of his utility 
services debt (&para; 1.g.) to $138.</P> 
<P>A Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent interviewed Applicant on February 5, 2004, about his delinquent property taxes and the unpaid financial 
judgment and medical bills. Applicant explained his former employer had obtained the judgment in a dispute over his vacation pay, which he was repaying at 
$140 per month. He denied owing the $6,078 mortgage debt, but acknowledged  the medical debt delinquencies and that he had been late at times in paying his 
property taxes, explaining that "neither [he] nor [his] wife are [sic] good at budgeting or paying bills." Applicant estimated miscellaneous monthly expenses of 
$640, leaving him with a monthly negative cash flow of $795. He admitted spending "near to $3,000.00 per year on golf, bowling and racing," but averred he 
would attempt to cut back on those expenses. He attributed his omission of the judgments and tax liens from his SF 86 to an oversight on his part. (Ex. 4) In 
June 2004, Applicant satisfied the judgment owed his former employer with a final payment of $162.50.</P> 
<P>            As of December 2004, Applicant owed $413 ($270 past due) to his utility provider (&para; 1.g.). He was current on his car loan payments (balance $13,366) 
and mortgage, and had no outstanding credit card debt, but had not paid the medical bills in collection. In February 2005, Applicant was laid off from his job at 
company X since there was no work for him without a clearance. For the next five months, he collected unemployment compensation of about $415 weekly. 
His spouse was employed as a cook at a local elementary school 20 hours weekly at an hourly wage of $13. They fell behind in their bills about $200 to $300 
every month during his layoff</P> 
<P>Applicant, who had already stopped his participation in a golf league, terminated his long distance telephone service sometime in Spring 2005 as his daughter 
had been incurring monthly charges of about $150. On her graduation from high school in June, she moved out of the house. As of June 2005, Applicant owed 
$746 to his natural gas provider but his account was not rated as past due. The medical and dental debts went unsatisfied. In July 2005, Applicant started 
working in machine assembly for a new employer at $17 an hour, $3.00 less per hour than he had earned at company X with no overtime and at some distance 
from his residence. His spouse worked for about a month as a cook to bring in extra income and they reduced their monthly miscellaneous expenses to $200, 
but with his additional transportation costs to get to work, they fell behind in their gas and telephone payments and did not pay their property taxes due in July 
2005.<A HREF="04-05196.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> As of August 2005, Applicant owed about $3,000 to $4,000 for utility services ($150 for his telephone and $795 for natural gas) and property taxes in 
addition to those debts in &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d. Applicant anticipated that once his spouse returned to her school job in September 2005, they would be able to catch 
up financially.</P> 
<P>Applicant just learned that his older daughter is pregnant. Although she lives with her boyfriend, Applicant expects he will have to provide some financial 
support for her.</P>

</P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Concerning the evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG>. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence 
is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. (&para; E2.A6.1.1.)</P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG>. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. ( &para; E2.A5.1.1.)</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude 
the following with respect to Guidelines F and E:</P> 
<P>Under Guideline F, financial considerations, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when the applicant is shown to have a history of 
excessive indebtedness, recurring financial difficulties, or a history of not meeting his financial obligations. The government must consider whether individuals 
granted access to classified information are, because of financial irresponsibility, in a position where they may be more susceptible to mishandling or 
compromising classified information. While the government alleged Applicant had delinquent debt of $7,944, it was not clearly established that Applicant 
owed the $70 debt in &para; 1.a.,<A HREF="04-05196.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> or that his account with the creditor in &para; 1.f. had ever been delinquent. Applicant is not being held responsible for the $6,078 (&para; 
1.b.) listed as a charge off balance following the refinancing of his home in 1998. The judgment awarded his former employer (&para; 1.e.) was satisfied in June 
2004, before the issuance of the SOR, and it arose because of a dispute over vacation pay. Favorable findings are returned as to &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f. of the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>Financial considerations concerns are raised by those debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.c., 1.d., and 1.g. The $763 dental debt and $337 medical debt have been in collection 
status since April 2003 and October 2002, respectively, and remain unpaid. Applicant has a history of falling behind in paying for his natural gas, and his 
account was $270 past due as of December 2004. While the creditor did not report a past due balance as of July 2005, Applicant owes about $795 for gas 
services. Yet, the primary concern in this case is not so much the amount of delinquent debt, given its relatively minor amount, but rather Applicant's history of 
financial mismanagement. As of February 2004, Applicant reported a net monthly negative cashflow of $795 (&para; 1.h.), due in significant part to miscellaneous 
expenses totaling about $640, including for golfing, bowling, car racing. DC &para; E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>, and &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. 
<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>, apply.</P> 
<P>Applicant has exhibited some effort to repay his creditors (<EM>see</EM> MC &para; E2.A6.1.3.6. <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts).  </EM>He paid his delinquent property tax debts in 1998 and 2002 by refinancing his mortgage. For several years, he has made payments, 
albeit late on occasion, to his natural gas provider. While they have not been enough to get caught up, the gas company has accepted his partial payments and 
not turned over any past due balances for collection. </P> 
<P>As of August 2005, Applicant was again behind in meeting his monthly expenses and obligations. Since he was laid off from his job with company X in 
February 2005, he has  fallen short of meeting his expenses by $200 to $300 monthly and did not pay his property taxes by the July 2005 due date. He estimates 
he is behind about $3,000 to $4,000, if the taxes are taken into account, although he has managed to remain current in his mortgage and car loans as he has in 
the past. While MC &para; E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM> applies because of the unforeseen job layoff, his present situation is not an 
aberration.</P> 
<P>To his credit,  Applicant has taken steps to reduce his expenses by canceling his long distance telephone service, and he no longer golfs. Yet, it is too soon to 
conclude that his financial problems are behind him. He has made no effort to repay the medical and dental debts in collection, his expenses continue to exceed 
his income, and there is no evidence that he has received financial counseling. SOR &para;&para; 1.c., 1.d. and 1.h. are resolved against him, but his payments to the gas 
company warrant a favorable finding as to &para; 1.g.</P> 
<P>Under Guideline E, personal conduct, the government alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his SF 86 by failing to disclose his tax liens, the $6,078 written off 
by the holder of his second mortgage in September 1998, or the $337 medical bill in collection. During his DSS interview in February 2004, Applicant 
attributed his negative response to the tax lien question to "oversight" on his part. At his hearing, Applicant explained that since the tax liens had been paid off, 
he "did not consider that [he] still had them." After he noted that an affirmative response was required even if the tax liens had been paid, Applicant testified, "I 
wasn't sure--I misread that, I believe." (Tr. 68-69) An inference of intentional concealment may fairly be drawn in this case based on the number (six) tax liens 
filed against him between April 1999 and May 2002 and the unambiguous inquiry ("In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for 
failing to pay taxes or other debts?"). His explanations do not persuade me otherwise.</P> 
<P>As for the omission of the two debts, Applicant testified that the second mortgage had been paid off, and that while he knew he was behind, he did not know 
how many days. While Applicant explained that the creditor took a lesser amount in a payoff to avoid him defaulting, there is no evidence that it was more than 
180 days delinquent as of the mortgage refinancing in September 1998. However, it stretches credulity for Applicant to claim that he did not believe the medical 
debt in collection since October 2002 or the dental debt of $763 (&para; 1.c., not alleged under &para;2.b.) were over 180 or 90 days delinquent as of his SF 86. His credit 
report of July 6, 2005 (Ex. 7) indicates there had been no activity on the medical debt since January 2002 or on the dental debt since August 2002. While 
Applicant admits he has poor financial management skills ("I'm not good at financial things, stuff." Tr. 71), he has not claimed he was unaware of his 
outstanding medical and dental debts. Even assuming he did not realize that medical debt (SOR &para; 1.d.) was delinquent more than 180 days, he knew it had been 
placed for collection in October 2002. While the government did not allege that Applicant falsified his response to question 39 on the SF 86 (any delinquencies 
over 90 days), his negative answer to question 39 casts considerable doubts on his claim of good faith mistake. His knowingly false answers to financial record 
inquiries on his SF 86 fall within DC &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and  material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>.) Applicant has a heavy burden of overcoming the 
negative inferences for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness raised by his failure to disclose his tax liens and delinquent debt to the government.</P> 
<P>The government must be assured that those granted access can be counted on to fulfill their obligations of full candor. When interviewed by the DSS agent in 
February 2004, Applicant admitted he had been delinquent at times in paying his personal property taxes and medical bills. MC &para; E2.A5.1.3.3. <EM>The individual 
made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>, is inapplicable where the correction was not reasonably 
prompt. His failure to provide a consistent, credible explanation for the omission of relevant financial record information from his SF 86 engenders doubt as to 
whether his representations can be relied on. SOR &para;&para; 2.a. and 2.b. are resolved against him.</P>
