<P>On August 31, 2005, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision (hereinafter "Decision") in this case.  Applicant submitted an undated document that was 
received by the Board on September 9, 2005.  After a review of the document, the Board elected to construe Applicant's submission as a request for 
reconsideration (hereinafter "Applicant's Request").  Department Counsel submitted a response, dated September 15, 2005, to Applicant's Request.  
Department Counsel's response set forth its reasons as to why Applicant's Request should be denied.  For the reasons that follow, the Board's August 31, 2005 
Decision stands as issued.</P> 
<P>The Board has the inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider its decisions.  However, there is no right to reconsideration; rather, the Board has the 
sole discretion to decide whether to exercise its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0621 (November 23, 1999) at pp. 
1-2.</P> 
<P>Applicant essentially repeats, with some elaboration, arguments that he raised on appeal.  The Board addressed those arguments in its August 31, 2005 
Decision.  The Board concludes Applicant has failed to articulate any persuasive reason for the Board to change its resolution of those arguments.  Accordingly, 
the Board's August 31, 2005 Decision stands.</P>
