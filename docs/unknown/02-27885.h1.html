<P>Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is a member of the optical sciences research staff for a defense contractor.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, holds passports from

1997, and he maintains occasional contact with a former supervisor and a colleague.  He has occasional contact with Israeli friends of his parents.  He has

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not 
grant a security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 
1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR alleges securing concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 15, 2004, and requested </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on August 11, 2004, and I conducted a 
hearing on September 14, 2004.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2004. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an advanced degree in optical sciences and is a member of the research staff for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer 
since September 27, 1999.  (Government Exhibit 1, pp. 1, 3-4)  Much of Applicant's work has military applications.  Most of his employer's business involves 
national defense.  (Tr. 57-58)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, having been born in Israel of parents who are native-born citizens of the United States.  His parents 
registered his birth with the United States Consulate in Jerusalem.  (Applicant's Exhibit A)   He and his parents visited Israel in 1977-78 and again in 1984.  
Appellant visited Israel alone in 1992, using his United States passport.  (Tr. 60-61)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant renewed his United States passport on January 27, 1997.  He obtained an Israeli passport on April 4, 1997, and he used it for travel to Israel on April 
16, 1997.  (Tr. 41-42, Applicant's Exhibit C)  He was employed as an intern by an international scientific institute in Israel from April to July 1997.  While in 
Israel, he used his United States passport to visit Egypt and return to Israel.  (Tr. 50-51; Applicant's Exhibit C)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Israeli passport expired on April 4, 2000.  In January 2004, Applicant asked the Israeli Consul General to issue a special permit that would permit 
travel to and from Israel without an Israeli passport.  The Israeli Consul General has not yet responded to Applicant's request.  (Tr. 42)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is registered for military service in Israel.  He contacted the Israel Defense Forces in 1997 to update his service deferment status.  He has not 
performed military service for Israel, but he testified at the hearing that he would be willing to serve if it were a prerequisite for permanently residing in Israel. 
(Tr. 53-54, 107)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contacts his previous supervisor at the international institute by telephone or e-mail approximately once a year.  (Tr. 83)  He has contact by telephone 
or e-mail about four times a year with an Israeli citizen and resident who was a colleague at the institute while Applicant was working as an intern.  (Tr. 62)  
Applicant has occasional contacts by telephone or e-mail with a married couple who are citizens and residents of Israel.  They and Applicant's parents became 
friends about 15 years ago while they were all living in the United States.  (Tr. 63)  Applicant has some great aunts, uncles, and cousins who are citizens and 
resident of Israel, but he has had no contact with them since 1997.  (Tr. 64-65)</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline C, "[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States."   Applicable disqualifying conditions include the exercise 
of dual citizenship (DC 1), the possession and/or use of a foreign passport (DC 2), and military service or willingness to bear arms for a foreign country (DC 3).  
Directive, &para;&para; E2.A3.1.2.1 - E2.A3.1.2.3).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is common knowledge that Israel is a democracy, a friend and ally of the United States, with strong political, economic, and cultural ties to the United States.  
Nevertheless, the two countries do not always agree.  Furthermore, "[t]he United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits that he exercises dual citizenship.  He is reluctant to relinquish his Israeli citizenship because it would be difficult 
for him to regain his Israeli citizenship "if and when [he decides] to relocate to Israel."  I conclude that DC 1 is established.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns based on dual citizenship can be mitigated by showing that the dual citizenship is based solely on the parents' citizenship.  Directive &para; 
E2.A3.1.3.1.  This mitigating condition is not established in this case, because Applicant has gone beyond possessing dual citizenship by operation of law.  He 
has made a conscious decision to retain his dual citizenship and keep open the option of residing permanently in Israel.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answer to the SOR states that he is willing to relinquish his Israeli passport if other provisions can be made that will permit him to visit Israel 
without an Israeli passport.  Israeli citizens, including dual citizens, must enter Israel with an Israeli passport; otherwise, they will not be permitted to exit.  
(Applicant's Exhibit F, p. 2)  Applicant has not received a response to his request for a waiver of this requirement.  Applicant testified at the hearing that he will 
renew his Israeli passport if it is the only way he can travel back to Israel.  (Tr. 68)  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's possession and use of his Israeli passport establish DC 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When DC 2 applies, the clarifying guidance issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000 (Money Memorandum), 
requires that a clearance be denied or revoked "unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate 
agency of the United States Government."  The Money Memorandum also makes it clear that Guideline C recognizes "no mitigating factor related to the 
applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country."  Surrender of a passport contemplates returning it 
to the issuing authority.  Merely keeping a passport until it expires does not satisfy the guidance in the Money Memorandum.  ISCR Case No. 01-224306 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2003).  Applicant has submitted no evidence of compliance with the Money Memorandum.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that Applicant updated his status with the Israeli Defense Forces in 1997 does not <EM>per se </EM>establish DC 3.  As Applicant explained in his answer to the 
SOR, he was required by Israeli law to update his status as a son of an immigrant to avoid being drafted at age 18 and to allow him to visit Israel without 
compromising his deferment from military service.  Although Applicant has not served in the Israeli Defense Forces, he appears willing to serve as a 
prerequisite for permanent residence in Israel.  I conclude that DC 3 is established by his willingness to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces as a consequence of 
being allowed to live there permanently.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record establishes that Applicant has a strong attraction to Israel, that living in the United States is a temporary condition, and that, at some future date 
consistent with his family needs, he is likely to move to Israel permanently.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was "open to the possibility" of 
moving to Israel in approximately 10 years.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that he intends to move to Israel eventually, but that he is now contemplating the 
move in "10, 20 years - 30 years down the road."  (Tr. 68)  After Applicant answered the SOR, he married and now has a son and a stepson.  (Tr. 51) His 
changed family status has caused him to postpone his plan to reside permanently in Israel within 5-10 years.  (Tr. 52) He explained that the plan is "on the back 
burner now as something down the road when the time seems right."  (Tr. 92) He is attracted to the possibility of residing permanently in Israel because of his 
religion, beliefs, and heritage.  (Tr. 88) I conclude that Applicant's foreign preference under Guideline C is established.  No mitigating conditions have been 
established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1)may arise when "[a]n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no immediate family members in Israel at present.  He has no contact with his distant cousins, great aunts, and great uncles who reside in Israel.  
His parents have indicated interest in moving to Israel at some indefinite date in the future.  Applicant's annual contact with a previous supervisor appears to be 
purely professional and not based on close ties of affection.  Department Counsel did not produce any evidence that Applicant's quarterly contact with a former 
graduate student is based on close ties of affection.  Similarly, Applicant's contacts with family friends of long standing appear to be based on parents' 
friendships, and there is no evidence of close ties of affection between Applicant and this family.  Unlike close family members, there is no presumption that 
Applicant has close ties of affection for friends and professional associates.  <EM>Compare</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 
20, 2002) (rebuttable presumption of close ties of affection or obligation to immediate family members of spouse).  Thus, I conclude that the DC 1 is not 
established regarding any of these relationships.</SPAN></P>
