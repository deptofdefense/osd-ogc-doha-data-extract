  Given the state of the record below, the Board is unable to determine whether the Administrative Judge admitted Government Exhibit 6 into evidence.  Furthermore, there is no copy of Government Exhibit 6 in the case file.  Because of the state of the record below, the Board is unable to address  Applicant's appeal argument concerning Government Exhibit 6.  Because the case is being remanded, the Board notes -- as a matter of judicial economy --  that throughout the record , the decision below, and the Applicant's appeal brief, there is evidence of uncertainty, ambiguity, or confusion due to multiple  methods of enumerating Applicant's Exhibits.  Case remanded with instructions.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 8, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Administrative 
Judge Barry M. Sax issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated March 3, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred in considering Government Exhibit 6, (2) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred in not specifically discussing one of Applicant's documentary exhibits,  (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in his findings 
of fact, (4) whether the Administrative Judge erred in admitting Government Exhibit 5 into evidence, and (5) whether the Administrative Judge erred in not 
applying Guideline H, Mitigating Condition 3.  For the reasons that follow, the Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing 
consistent with the rulings and instructions set forth in this Decision and Remand Order.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases).</P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in considering Government Exhibit 6</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred in considering 
Government Exhibit 6 because the document was incomplete and was not provided in a timely manner to Applicant.  </P> 
<P>Based upon the record before us, the Board is unable to consider the substance of Applicant's appeal argument.  The Board cannot determine from the decision 
and the record, whether the Administrative Judge admitted Government Exhibit 6 into evidence.  Indeed, the Board cannot locate Government Exhibit 6 in the 
case file.  Accordingly, the case is remanded to the Judge for him to: a) locate, identify, and place in the record, Government Exhibit 6, and b) issue a new 
decision stating whether Government Exhibit 6 was admitted into evidence.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0476 (July 22, 1999) at p. 4 ("Failing to retain copies of 
those items in the case file resulted in an incomplete case record, which has the potential of impairing the appeal rights of the parties and interfering with the 
ability of the Board to carry out its appellate functions").</P> 
<P>Further, as a matter of administrative economy, another procedural aspect of the case warrants discussion.  Throughout the record, the decision, and Applicant's 
appeal brief, there is evidence of uncertainty, ambiguity, or confusion due to multiple methods of enumerating Applicant's Exhibits.<A HREF="04-01576.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Because the case is 
remanded for further processing by the Administrative Judge, the Board instructs the Judge to identify and use in his remand decision one method of 
enumerating Applicant's Exhibits, and to label all Applicant's Exhibits accordingly.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in not specifically discussing one of Applicant's documentary exhibits</SPAN>; 3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in 
his findings of fact</SPAN>; 4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in admitting Government Exhibit 5 into evidence</SPAN>; and 5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge 
erred in not applying Guideline H, Mitigating Condition 3</SPAN>.  Because the error identified by Applicant warrants a remand that will result in reopening the record 
and issuance of a new decision, it would be premature to address Applicant's other appeal issues.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has demonstrated error that warrants remand.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.2, the Board remands the case to 
the Administrative Judge for the issuance of a new decision in accordance with the instructions herein.</P>
