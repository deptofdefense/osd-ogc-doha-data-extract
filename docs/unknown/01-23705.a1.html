<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 23, 2003, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  
Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated July 31, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's reduction in rank and departure from the 
Army are erroneous; and (2) whether the Board should recommend this case be considered for waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  For the reasons that follow, the 
Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="01-23705.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's reduction in rank and departure from the Army are erroneous</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant's make 
statements about the circumstances under which his rank in the Army was reduced from E-7 to E-1 as well as the circumstances under which he left the Army.  
The Board construes those statements as raising the issue of whether the Judge's findings about those two matters are erroneous.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's arguments are based in part on record evidence, and in part on factual assertions that go beyond the record evidence.  The Board cannot consider 
new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Furthermore, Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's findings based 
on assertions that go beyond the record evidence.  Applicant had the opportunity to submit evidence for the Judge to consider in his case and he took advantage 
of that opportunity by submitting a response to the File of Relevant Material.  Applicant does not have the right to offer additional evidence on appeal to 
challenge the Judge's findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>To the extent that Applicant's arguments are based on record evidence, they fail to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  The Judge's findings about 
Applicant's reduction in rank and departure from the Army reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence before him.  And, in any event, the Judge's 
challenged findings are not material to his ultimate adverse security clearance decision, which is based on application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, not Applicant's 
reduction in rank and departure from the Army.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend this case be considered for waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge made findings of fact about 
Applicant's history of criminal conduct and concluded that Applicant's 1991 misdemeanor conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 because Applicant had been 
sentenced to more than one year imprisonment as a result of that conviction.<A HREF="01-23705.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The Judge concluded that application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 required an unfavorable 
security clearance decision in Applicant's case and recommended Applicant's case not be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about his history of criminal conduct.  Nor does Applicant challenge the Judge's 
conclusion that his 1991 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  However, Applicant asks the Board to recommend that his case be considered further for a 
waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize an exception to the statutory 
prohibition against granting or renewing a security clearance for cases covered by 10 U.S.C.&sect;986(c)(1) or 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(4).</P> 
 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C.&sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, 
DOHA is the Director of the Component's Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case." (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue." (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense." (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)." (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>Because Applicant does not dispute the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to his case, all that remains for the Board to do is consider his request that it recommend 
further consideration of his case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  Such a request, however, places the Board in an unusual situation.  The Operating 
Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  Furthermore, 
under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver be 
considered, but is authorized only to state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 
986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."</P> 
 
<P>Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Administrative Judge 
below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a 
waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 precluded him from making a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case is not at 
issue on appeal.  Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the evidence as a whole and states the 
following: The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
