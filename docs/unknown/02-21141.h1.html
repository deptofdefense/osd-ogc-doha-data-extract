<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 66 year-old native born United States citizen.  Applicant's fianc&eacute;e is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and resided there until she 
recently moved with her daughter to the United States to marry Applicant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's contact with his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s family members who reside in China, none of 
whom work for the Chinese government, is extremely limited.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The evidence establishes that Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence because of  his 
strong attachment to the United States, and because his fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s family members </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February 
19, 2003</SPAN>, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign influence (guideline B) concerns 
because of the foreign residency and citizenship of Applicant's fianc&eacute;e.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized response dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 10, 2003</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 16, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on May 8, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to 
me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 9, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 21, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit 
(Exhibits A) and offered his own testimony. The transcript was received on June 2, 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, 
specifically his </SPAN>fianc&eacute;e<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation, is not United States citizens and/or may be subject to duress. </SPAN>In his response 
to the SOR, Applicant admits all five allegations. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 66 year old employee of a defense contractor. He is a native </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">born United States citizen. He holds a Ph.D. degree and was an associate professor 
and held other positions for a United States university from 1970 through 2001.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He is currently divorced , and he has two grown children, ages 37 and 38.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant first met the woman, who became his fianc&eacute;e, on an internet dating service which featured Asian women.  After corresponding on the internet with 
her, Applicant traveled to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> on one occasion for two to three weeks in July 2001, to meet this woman physically and to see if they 
were compatible. (Transcript at 20-25.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China and resided there until May 2003, when she moved to the  United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> with the plan to 
marry Applicant. She is 46 years old, speaks extremely limited English, and she has been an elementary school teacher in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for 20 
years.  The </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has a thirteen year old daughter, who is also a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and who moved to the United States with her 
mother. (Transcript at 23, 24.)  Applicant testified that he and his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">were scheduled to be married on May 22, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s parents are retired college professors. Applicant met and conversed with the mother on one occasion, but he has never met or talked to her 
father.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His fianc&eacute;e has two sisters in China, and Applicant was not aware of their employment status. The husband of one sister is a police officer for a province 
in China. Applicant's contact with these family members has been very limited. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 50, 51.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing Applicant testified that he would never do anything to hurt the interests of the United States and that he would terminate his relationship with his 
wife rather than be a disloyal American. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 57.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He introduced two letters from individuals, both of whom highly recommended him as a loyal 
American. (Exhibit A.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. A condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3. A condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's 
immediate family member, his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is a citizen of and has resided in the People's Republic of China. The Chinese citizenship and former residency creates 
the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. 
ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As Applicant's  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is a citizen of and has resided until recently in the People's Republic of China, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the 
Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that she does not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 
2002.)  However,  I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to 
grant him the clearance. This decision is based on several factors. These include the fact that Applicant is a native born United States citizen, who has lived his 
entire life in the United States, and his only trip to China was in 2001, to meet the woman who would become his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The family members, who are of a 
concern, are related to Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and not to Applicant, and his contact with her family members has been casual and extremely infrequent. Finally, 
Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fianc&eacute;e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and her daughter now reside in the United States. Accordingly, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 does apply to this case, and 
Guideline B is found for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
