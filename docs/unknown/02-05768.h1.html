<P>Thirty-year-old Applicant's 1997 hospitalization for a <EM>manic episode</EM>, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder, a condition that may indicate a defect in 
judgment, reliability, or stability, and his continuing treatment with a psychologist and psychiatrist for therapy and medication supervision to manage his bipolar 
symptoms, has satisfied all questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  The personality disorder is under control or in remission, and has a

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written statement, dated August 26, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on September 23, 2003.  A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.  Any such submissions were due by November 9, 2003, and he submitted additional materials on October 31, 2003.  The Department Counsel had 
no objection to the materials submitted.  The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has denied the factual allegations pertaining to emotional, mental, and personality disorders under Guideline I.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which has not been divulged.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant abused marijuana on a continuing basis from about 1989 until January 1999.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  During the period September 1996 until February 1997 his marijuana 
use occurred about once each day.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In February 1997, Applicant was admitted to a hospital following a <EM>manic outburst</EM>, medically characterized as a <EM>manic

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)</EM> classifies the various bipolar disorders as mood 
disorders.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant was hospitalized for about one month,<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> treated with mood stabilizing medication, and discharged to outpatient care.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Since his 1997 
hospitalization, and continuing until about May 2002, Applicant was treated on a monthly basis by a psychiatrist who prescribed and monitored his 
medications.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Another psychiatrist took over and has been providing therapy and medication supervision, also on a monthly basis, since May 2002.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>On June 30, 2003, Applicant participated in a mental health evaluation conducted by an active duty military clinical psychologist, not a psychiatrist as alleged in 
the SOR.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Applicant purportedly acknowledged his most recent <EM>depressive episode </EM>occurred in Spring 2001, and his most recent <EM>manic</EM> or <EM>hypomanic episode 
</EM>occurred in February 2002.  As a result of the <EM>manic episode</EM>, Applicant was required to take time off from work for seven weeks.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He eventually returned to 
work with reduced work hours, with his work schedule gradually increasing over time.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  As of July 1, 2003, Applicant was working a 36-hour work week.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  
Later that month his work schedule increased to a 40-hour week.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant purportedly currently takes four different prescribed medications,<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> and along with his monthly therapy sessions with his psychiatrist and 
psychologist, is better able to manage his condition because of:</P> 
 
<P>. . . increased comfort with a new psychiatrist, awareness of risk factors, and understanding of the importance of regular sleep, taking medications, and 
seeking/following his doctor's advice. admitted to involved in two criminal incidents which occurred within six months of each other approximately 28 years 
ago.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Based on the mental health evaluation, and the information furnished by Applicant, but without the benefit of any of Applicant's psychiatric records, as the 
psychiatrist was unavailable during the period of the evaluation,<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> the clinical psychologist rendered the following diagnosis: Axis I (Mental Disorders): 296.40 
Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic.  Axis II (Personality Disorders or Traits): V71.09 No Diagnosis on Axis II.  According to the <EM>DSM-IV-TR</EM>, among the diagnostic criteria for that particular diagnosis are:</P> 
 
<P>A. Currently, or most recently, in a <EM>hypomanic episode</EM> </P> 
 
<P>B. There has previously been at least one <EM>manic episode </EM>or <EM>mixed episode</EM></P> 
 
<P>C. The mood symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The <EM>DSM-IV-TR</EM> describes the criteria for <EM>hypomanic episode </EM>in the following manner:</P> 
 
<P>A. A distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting throughout at least 4 days, that is clearly different from the usual nondepressed 
mood.</P> 
 
<P>B. During the period of mood disturbance, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been present to 
a significant degree:</P> 
 
<P>(1) inflated self-esteem or grandiosity</P> 
 
<P>(2) decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep)</P> 
 
<P>(3) more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking</P> 
 
<P>(4) flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing</P> 
 
<P>(5) distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli)</P> 
 
<P>(6) increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation</P> 
 
<P>(7) excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, 
sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)</P> 
 
<P>C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the person when not symptomatic.</P> 
 
<P>D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.</P> 
 
<P>E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, or to necessitate hospitalization, and there are no 
psychotic features.</P> 
 
<P>F. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or a general medical 
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The clinical diagnosis pertaining to Axis II (Personality Disorders or Traits) was, as indicated above, V71.09 No Diagnosis on Axis II.  The actual interpretation 
of that particular V Code for "persons without reported diagnosis encountered during examination and investigation of individuals and populations,"<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> is 
"observation for suspected mental condition - other suspected mental condition."<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  In other words, observation only, without diagnosis.</P> 
 
<P>The clinical psychologist summarized: Applicant is diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on past symptoms and current ongoing treatment; the disorder has a 
continuing nature; it requires continuing and regular management; it "could potentially cause a significant defect in judgment and reliability;" and it "could 
potentially cause a significant defect in psychological, social, or occupational functioning."<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He also added that Applicant "is using medications and regular 
therapy to effectively manage bipolar symptoms."<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  The clinical psychologist recommended Applicant's treating psychiatrist and psychologist be contacted for 
more information pertaining to current symptoms, diagnosis, functioning, treatment, and prognosis.<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's current psychiatrist, who has been providing therapy and medication supervision on a monthly basis since May 2002, disputes the information 
appearing in the clinical evaluation.  The psychiatrist avers Applicant has had "no recurrence or mania or hospitalization since [1997].<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  In his regular contact 
with Applicant over the period of treatment, he has "not seen significant decompensation in [Applicant's] emotional stability."<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, he stated 
Applicant "has been rigorous in following his mood stabilizing regimen."<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant graduated with a B.S.M.E. from a major university in May 1995, and has been employed by the same company, as a mechanical engineer II since 
October 1999.  The quality of his performance has not been developed in the record.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders - Guideline I: Emotional, mental, and personality disorders can cause a significant deficit in an 
individual's psychological, social and occupational functioning.  These disorders are of security concern because they may indicate a defect in 
judgment, reliability, or stability.  A credentialed mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist), employed by, acceptable to or 
approved by the government, should be utilized in evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information fully and properly, and 
particularly for consultation with the individual's mental health care provider.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-05768.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the Government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline I, the government has established its case.  By his own admission, Applicant was admitted to the hospital in February 1997 for a 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>manic episode </EM>which was eventually diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.  Since that 1997 hospitalization, and continuing through the present, Applicant has been 
treated on a monthly basis by psychiatrists who provided therapy and prescribed and monitored his medications.  It is undisputed that Applicant has been 
"rigorous" in following his mood stabilizing regimen, including regular therapy and medication.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The remaining evidence is in dispute.  For example, the clinical psychologist commented that Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on "past 
symptoms and current ongoing treatment."  Yet those symptoms are in dispute for they are based substantially, if not solely, on a layperson's 
opinion--Applicant's recollections--and not on any medical or psychiatric records or through independent professional assessment and diagnosis.  In this 
instance, the opinion of the clinical psychologist--the nonexamining physician--must be an informed one if it conflicts with the opinion of the treating 
physician.  As noted above, Applicant's psychiatrist was unavailable during the period of the evaluation and none of Applicant's psychiatric treatment records 
were reviewed, and the Axis II "diagnosis" was V71.09 No Diagnosis, which is nothing other than "observation for suspected mental condition - other 
suspected mental condition," or an observation only, without diagnosis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The clinical psychologist also commented that the condition or disorder has a continuing nature.  It is unclear if Applicant's most recent </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>depressive episode 
</EM>occurred in Spring 2001, or if his most recent </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>manic</EM> or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>hypomanic episode </EM>occurred in February 2002, as reported.  Applicant's psychiatrist certainly disputes 
that contention and has clearly stated that Applicant has had no recurrence of mania or hospitalization since [1997].  Applicant purportedly acknowledged to the 
clinical psychologist what his psychiatrist has denied.  What has been referred to as a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> manic</EM> or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>hypomanic episode</EM> by the clinical psychologist--a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> distinct 
period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting throughout at least four days, that is clearly different from the usual nondepressed 
mood--may have been misunderstood by Applicant as being something that it really was not, in psychological terms.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The assessment by the clinical psychologist that the disorder has a continuing nature is somewhat less than accurate for it completely discounts both the 
possibility and probability that the disorder might be in full or partial remission.  In addition, subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR alleges statements purportedly made 
by Applicant's initial psychiatrist--allegations denied by Applicant--facts not supported by any evidence in the record from that psychiatrist.  In the absence of 
documents supporting those comments coming from the psychiatrist, I will not consider them in the abstract.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The clinical psychologist also commented that the disorder requires continuing and regular management, and Applicant's psychiatrist has acknowledged that 
Applicant is following his mood stabilizing regimen, including regular therapy and medication.  Furthermore, the Department Counsel has offered no evidence 
to rebut that evidence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The major area of concern, and one for which there is inconsistent and incomplete evidence, is the observation by the clinical psychologist that the disorder 
"could potentially cause a significant defect in judgment and reliability;" and "could potentially cause a significant defect in psychological, social, or 
occupational functioning."  The clinical psychologist recommended that Applicant's treating psychiatrist and psychologist be contacted for information 
pertaining to Applicant's current symptoms, diagnosis, functioning, treatment, and prognosis.  Yet despite the absence of all that information, the clinical 
psychologist was able to offer the above opinions, seemingly based purely on textbook commentary.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As stated above, one of the conditions set forth in the criteria for a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>hypomanic episode </EM>is that the episode is "not severe enough to cause marked impairment in 
social or occupational functioning, or to necessitate hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features." On the other hand, one of the conditions set forth in 
the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder, most recent episode hypomanic, is that the mood symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in 
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  It is unclear what constitutes "clinically significant distress or impairment."  In any event, 
Applicant's disorder in this regard seemingly falls within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A9.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>an opinion by a credentialed mental health professional</EM> 
that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability).  DC E2.A9.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>information that suggests that 
an individual has failed to follow appropriate medical advice relating to treatment of a condition, e.g., failure to take prescribed medication</EM>), and DC 
E2.A9.1.2.4. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>information that suggests that the individual's current behavior indicates a defect in his or her judgment or reliability</EM>) clearly do not apply in 
this instance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Assuming the accuracy of the diagnosis made by the clinical psychologist, as well as the fact that there has been no recurrence of mania since 1997, or even if 
there were some manifestations in Spring 2001 and February 2002, as found by the clinical psychologist, the question remains whether there is an indication of 
a current problem, thus activating </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A9.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is no indication of a current problem</EM>).  In this regard, it is interesting to note 
that the DC generally refers to the terms condition, treatment, or behavior, rather than the term problem as found in the MC.  Nevertheless, based on all of the 
above, I conclude that there is sufficient evidence to find Applicant's condition, disorder, or problem remains current, thus negating consideration of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 
E2.A9.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, the evidence does support the activation of MC E2.A9.1.3.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>recent opinion by a credentialed mental health professional that an individual's 
previous emotional, mental, or personality disorder is cured, under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation</EM>).  The 
credentialed mental health professionals, both the clinical psychologist and Applicant's psychiatrist, agree he is using medications and regular therapy to 
effectively manage bipolar symptoms.  With the psychiatrist's opinion that Applicant has not exhibited any significant decompensation in his emotional
