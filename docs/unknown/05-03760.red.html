<P>Unbeknownst to Applicant, two women filed child support claims against him in California, which he discovered when he received a credit report to use in financing the purchase of his home. Applicant 
is paying the claims, has custody of one of the children, and is contesting paternity in the other. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1960), 
as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 4 January 2006 detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 17 January 2006 and elected to have his case decided without a hearing. The Department Counsel originally assigned to the case prepared a file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated 22 February 2006, and sent it to Applicant. Applicant wrote the following on the FORM and returned it to Department Counsel: "I would like to request a hearing. I have recent 
relevant material and documents I would like to report." Apparently the original Department Counsel agreed to this request and abandoned the FORM. There is no evidence Department Counsel has 
authority to grant such a request, but in the interests of expeditiously processing this case, I decided to conduct the hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to another administrative judge on 20 April 2006 and transferred to me on 20 July 2006. On 1 August 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I left the record open for Applicant to submit additional evidence and received Ex. C, without objection from Department 
Counsel. DOHA received the hearing transcript (R.) on 11 August 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old operations project engineer for a defense contractor. He was graduated from college in California in 2002. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Utah.</P> 
 
<P>In the Spring of 2004, after he submitted his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant obtained a credit report so he could apply for a construction loan. The credit report revealed a lien for child 
support arrearage issued by a county court in California. He inquired as to this lien and was informed that the case listed on his credit report did not exist. The court ordered Applicant's credit report 
corrected. Ex. 4 at 1. But soon thereafter, Applicant received notice from that county child support agency that two cases for child support and reimbursement for public assistance had been reopened 
against him. <EM>Id.</EM></P> 
 
<P>One of the cases was initiated by TW, a woman with whom Applicant had had a relationship many years ago. She had obtained a default paternity judgment against Applicant and applied for food 
stamps and child support for her child. Applicant had seen the child shortly after its birth in 1988, but denied it was his. The county reported Applicant owed more than $37,800 on that account. The 
child is now 18 years old and married.</P> 
 
<P>The second case involved a boy, born to Applicant and CB in 1995, while Applicant was enrolled college. He provided CB with support for the child, but admits it was sporadic because he did not hold 
a full time job while he was attending college. Applicant and CB split up, but Applicant provided CB $300 a month since he gained full-time employment. Nevertheless, CB apparently filed for support 
through the county child support office. Because he had left California to take full time employment, Applicant was never served with notice and was not aware CB had filed for assistance. The county 
reported Applicant owed more than $9,900 on this account. </P> 
 
<P>Because of Applicant's inquiries, the county learned where to find him and started to garnish his wages in March 2005. Meanwhile, Applicant learned that California had enacted a new law, effective 
January 2005, establishing a two-year period during which a person who had previously been established as a parent could contest parentage through genetic testing. Cal Fam Code &sect; 7646. He located 
TW and her daughter via the Internet, and they agreed to genetic paternity testing. A national laboratory tested specimens provided by Applicant, TW, and her daughter under chain of custody 
procedures, and concluded the probability of Applicant being the father at 0.0%. Ex. A at 9.</P> 
 
<P>Based on the results of the genetic paternity tests, and the new statute, Applicant petitioned the court to set aside the judgment of paternity in the case of TW's daughter. The county opposes Applicant's 
petition. It claims that, as the daughter has reached the age of 18, the court no long has either <EM>in personam</EM> or subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It also objects to the chain of custody procedure as 
not complying with that required in the statute. Applicant had a court date for 21 August 2006 to resolve the issue. If the Court sets aside the judgment of paternity, it will wipe out more than $11,000 of 
his debt.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's son is now 10 years old, and in March 2006 moved to Utah to live with Applicant. The boy's mother has closed the case against Applicant, so all he owes is the arrearage. Applicant earns 
over $5,000 a month and is able and willing to make the payments on the arrearage.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information 
bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President 
authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." 
Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Each security clearance decision "must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; 6.3. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F--Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had two child support accounts totaling more than $20,600 that were delinquent. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the debts, but asserted he was then delinquent 
in the amount of $16,355.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive &para;&nbsp;E2.A6.1.1. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness 
and ability to protect classified information.</SPAN> The evidence established <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations DC E2.A6.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate </SPAN>financial security concerns by establishing the debts resulted from behavior largely beyond the applicant's control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3) or he initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC E2.A6.1.3.6). The debts became delinquent because Applicant was not notified in a timely manner that the mothers of his children had filed child 
support and financial assistance claims with the state. He had supported the child he believed was his and has made good-faith efforts to resolve these debts by paying on the arrearages and contesting 
the paternity of the girl. I conclude both MC E2.A6.1.3.3 and E2.A6.1.3.6 apply.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The Whole Person</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance." Directive E2.2.1. "Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination." <EM>Id. </EM>In evaluating Applicant's case, I have considered the 
adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive &para; E2.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The delinquent debts resulted from the failure of the state of California to notify Applicant of the debt. Applicant has been paying on the debts and has sought to legally resolve the paternity of TW's 
daughter. He has custody of his son and is caring for him. Under all the circumstances of this case, I find Applicant failed to pay these debts because he was not aware of them and there is almost no 
likelihood of recurrence. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P>
