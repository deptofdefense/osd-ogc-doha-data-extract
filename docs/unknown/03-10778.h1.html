<P>Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, but his mother, six cousins, and a family friend are citizens and residents of Brazil. He falsified his application for 
employment by a defense contractor by representing he was a college graduate who had been accepted in a master's degree program, when in fact he had 
completed only three years of college.  He failed to correct the falsification when his promotion to vice-president was announced.  He has never informed his 
employer of the falsification.  Security concerns based on foreign influence are mitigated, but concerns based on personal conduct are not mitigated.  Clearance 
is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR on December 8, 2004, by dividing one compound allegation into two and 
deleting one allegation.  With no objection from Applicant, the motion to amend was granted on December 10, 2004.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The amended SOR alleges security 
concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an undated document, Applicant answered the original SOR in writing.  He admitted some allegations and denied some, and he requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 1, 2004.  On November 10, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for December 
10, 2004.  On the day of the hearing, the case was reassigned to me, without objection from Applicant, because of an unexpected unavailability of the assigned 
judge.  The case was heard as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old vice-president for business development of a defense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since May 1984.  He 
received a security clearance in December 1986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his employment application, executed on May 10, 1984, Applicant answered "yes" to the question whether he received a college degree and he described the 
degree as a bachelor of science in electrical engineering.  During his employment interview, Applicant told the interviewer he had been accepted in a master's 
degree program.  The interviewer made a handwritten notation on Applicant's resume reflecting his acceptance into the graduate program.  Applicant's resume 
states he was a candidate for a bachelor of science degree to be awarded in May 1984.  In fact, Applicant had dropped out of college after three years because of 
financial and academic problems, and he never received a college degree.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was promoted to his current position as a vice-president in 2001, the president of the company sent out a memorandum announcing the 
promotion.  The memorandum stated Applicant had a bachelor of science degree and a master of science degree, both in electrical engineering.  Although 
Applicant has neither a bachelor's nor a master's degree, he did nothing to correct the error.  As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not informed his 
employer that he falsely represented he had a college degree on his initial employment application, nor had he corrected his employer's belief that he had a 
master's degree.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 83-year-old mother was born in Brazil and is a Brazilian citizen.  She became a permanent resident of the U.S. in 1955, and she worked for many 
years as a domestic cook.  Applicant was born while his mother lived in the U.S., and he is a native-born U.S. citizen.  He does not claim Brazilian citizenship.  
Applicant's mother retired in 1987 and returned to Brazil.  She is financially independent, receives no financial assistance from Applicant, and is not employed 
by or connected with the Brazilian government.  Applicant talks to her weekly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has six cousins who are Brazilian residents and citizens.  One cousin is a sergeant in the Brazilian Air Force.  None of his other cousins are employed 
by or connected with the Brazilian government.  They range from 44 to 50 years old and all live in the same general neighborhood.  Applicant and his cousins 
talk frequently, usually about his mother's health.  Applicant lent one cousin $1,000.00 and forgave the loan after she paid back about $300.00.  He and his 
mother each gave $500.00 to another cousin.  He also sent $300.00 to a disabled childhood friend of his mother.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a family friend, his godmother's son, who is a Brazilian resident and citizen.  The friend is a carpenter, and is not employed by or connected with 
the Brazilian government.  Before his godmother's death, Applicant had contact with the family friend every three or four years.  Since his godmother's death, 
Applicant talks to him at least twice a month, because Applicant was the administrator of his godmother's estate.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is responsible for business development for his employer.  He frequently travels to Brazil on business and to visit his family.  He knows a number of 
Brazilian government officials and discusses business matters with them.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Brazil is a democracy.  The U.S. and Brazil have traditionally enjoyed friendly, active relations encompassing a broad political and economic agenda.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) are applicable in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4 is established because Applicant concealed information that increases his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.  In 
his employment application, Applicant falsely represented he was a college graduate who had been accepted in a graduate program.  He perpetuated the 
falsehood by doing nothing when his promotion announcement reflected bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering.  He has never disclosed his 
falsehood to his employer.  He is vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress by anyone who threatens his continued employment by exposing his 
falsification to his employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5 is established because Applicant has exhibited a pattern of dishonesty.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.  Applicant began his employment with a lie in May 1984, 
perpetuated the lie when his promotion to vice-president was announced in 2001, and has lived the lie every day of his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No mitigating conditions are established.  Applicant has done nothing to correct the falsification or reduce his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  
Although his original falsification occurred more than 20 years ago, it is not mitigated by the passage of time, because Applicant's deception regarding his 
educational credentials has been a continuing course of conduct up to the present.  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-3695, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 453 at *7 (App. Bd. Oct. 
16, 2002) (failure to pay debts is continuing course of conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1)may arise when "[a]n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 3) also 
may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  DC 1 is established with respect to 
Applicant's mother, cousins, and family friend (SOR &para;&para; 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c.).  DC 1 and DC 3 are established with respect to Applicant's cousin who is serving 
in the Brazilian Air Force.  Applicant's financial support to some of his cousins (SOR &para; 2.d.) demonstrates his ties of affection and obligation to his cousins, but 
it raises no independent security concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) . . . are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government has produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden has shifted to 
Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2003).  Applicant's  ties to Brazil and the possible effect they may have on Applicant's conduct are relevant considerations under Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence).  ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding 
classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or 
country has interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although Brazil historically has been 
regarded as friendly to the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, 
sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or 
national security. Finally, we know that even friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and 
technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, 
its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to 
government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family 
member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither Applicant's mother nor his extended family members are foreign agents.  They are not involved in businesses practicing economic espionage.  Their 
social, economic, and political positions make them unlikely targets of coercion or exploitation.  Applicant's cousin who is in the Brazilian Air Force is too 
low-ranking to be involved in military policy or international affairs.  Brazil is a country friendly to the U.S.  Applicant's family friend is a carpenter, not 
connected to the government.  I conclude MC 1 is established for Applicant's mother, and the same considerations underlying MC 1 apply to his cousins and 
family friend.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  Before 
his godmother's death, Applicant's contact with the family friend was very infrequent and casual.  It has become more frequent and formal only because 
Applicant is the administrator of his godmother's estate, and not because of any change in the personal relationship between Applicant and the family friend.  I 
conclude MC 3 is established with respect to the family friend.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering Applicant's relationships with his mother, extended family, and a family friend together as well as individually, I conclude the security 
concern based on the possibility of foreign influence is mitigated.  Accordingly, I resolve the allegations under Guideline B for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
