  Applicant was convicted of five counts of selling amphetamine and cocaine to undercover police officers in 1989 (she had become addicted to amphetamines after she began  taking them to lose weight).  She was sentenced to twenty years in prison, but was paroled after  one year.  Her probation was revoked in February 1993 and she served another 60 days in prison  after she tested positive for amphetamines.  Applicant's drug abuse is mitigated but her  involvement in drug trafficking for at least three years--prior to her arrest--is serious criminal  conduct which cannot not be mitigated in view of her recent probation infraction.  Consideration  was also given to the fact that Applicant will be on supervised probation for another four years.   Clearance denied.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>On August 30, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 19, 1996, and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative
Judge on October 7, 1996.  On November 7, 1996, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue,
deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of three
exhibits; Applicant relied on 2 exhibits, three witnesses, and her own testimony.  A transcript of
the proceedings was received on January 14, 1996.</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Applicant has admitted, with explanation, all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug
involvement (Criterion H) set forth under subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f., and all of the factual
allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (Criterion J) under subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.</P>

<P>	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 39 year old employee of a defense contractor.  She has worked for her
current employer since July 1995 and is applying for a clearance.<A HREF="96-0607.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>
<P>  A favorable preliminary
determination could not be made in her case because of her long-time involvement in the use and
trafficking of amphetamines (speed).</P>

<P>	Applicant's drug use began during the early 1970's while she was in high school.  She
smoked marijuana as often as daily during high school, but stopped using it after high school--in
about 1975--when she married someone who did not use drugs and did not want Applicant to
use them.  Applicant began using amphetamines around 1980 after she divorced in order to help
her lose weight. Initially, she used one or two lines a day; by 1989, she was using 1&frac12; grams
daily.  Applicant also used cocaine about 10 times between 1987 and 1989.</P>

<P>	Shortly after she began using amphetamines, Applicant began selling them in order to
support herself since she was not working regularly.  By the late 1980's she was selling
amphetamines on an almost daily basis (Tr. 47).  She continued to use and sell amphetamines
until she was arrested.</P>

<P>	On October 18, 1989, Applicant and her cohabitant were arrested and charged with
violating the Controlled Substance Act of State A after they had sold cocaine (one sale) and
methamphetamine (four sales) to undercover police officers on several different occasions. 
Applicant was indicted on four counts of selling methamphetamine, one count of selling cocaine,
and one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute--all felonies.  A jury
found Applicant guilty of the charges which alleged that she had sold methamphetamine and
cocaine, but not guilty of the charge which alleged possession of methamphetamine with intent
to distribute.  Applicant was sentenced to 20 years in prison on each of the five counts of
possession (sentences to run concurrently).  She was also ordered to participate in alcohol and
drug evaluation, and to pay a fine of $5,520.00.  </P>

<P>	After serving one year in prison, Applicant was paroled on July 5, 1991.  One year after
being paroled, she was allowed to serve the remainder of  her sentence on probation.  The
conditions of her probation included-- along with other requirements--the requirement that
Applicant abstain from all drugs and alcohol, and that she <STRONG>not</STRONG> <U><STRONG></U></STRONG>cohabit with the man who had
been her accomplice and co-defendant in the criminal charges.  Applicant's probation was
revoked on March 23, 1995, after she tested positive for amphetamines and was found to be
cohabiting with her co-defendant.  Applicant was ordered back to prison for 60 days.</P>

<P>	Applicant and her former co-defendant/cohabitant were married on February 16, 1996,
because it was the only way that she could continue to see him without violating the terms of her
probation (Tr.66).  Neither she nor her husband currently use illegal drugs.  Applicant is
currently taking a prescription medication for weight control (Applicant's answer to the SOR).</P>

<P>	Applicant loves her job; she enjoys and respects the people with whom she works.  Her
employer considers her to be a good worker whose performance in every rated element has been
consistent with the requirements of her position.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion H)</CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</STRONG></P>

<P>	( a)	drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the
Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>	(b)     	inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>(1)	Any drug abuse</P>

<P>	(2)	illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,
sale, or distribution.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(3)	A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>(1)	Any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,</P>

<P>	(2)	A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		</STRONG>None applicable.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>CONCLUSION</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria H and J.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion H. Applicant has admitted that
she used amphetamines to the point of addiction during the late 1980's, prior to her arrest on several
counts of selling methamphetamine and cocaine. In addition to using amphetamines daily for at least
three years, Applicant had also actively trafficked in amphetamines.  By her own admission, she was
selling amphetamines on an almost daily basis during the late 1980's (Tr. 47).  She sold drugs to
support her own habit, and to earn a living since she was unemployed during much of the time.</P>

<P>	Mitigation for Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs is found in the drug free life style
she has lived for most of the past seven years.  Except for using amphetamines on two or three
occasions in March 1993 incident to the revocation of her probation, Applicant has abstained from
all illegal drugs since her arrest in 1989.  She has regained custody of her daughter and is now more
involved and connected with her extended family than when she was using drugs (Tr. 32, 39, 58-59). 
 She is now taking a prescription drug to help her lose weight as an alternative to the amphetamines
on which she had previously come to rely.  All of the evidence indicates that Applicant has stopped
using illegal drugs even though she has not completed a drug treatment program or remained
committed to an aftercare support group such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA).  While she is subject
to random urinalysis as a condition of her probation, she has not been tested since being released
from prison after the revocation of her probation (Tr. 56).  The fact that she is subject to random
urinalysis makes it much less likely that she will again use drugs--especially in view of her
expressed aversion toward returning to prison (Tr. 59).  Criterion H is concluded for Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion J.  Applicant has been convicted
of five felony counts of selling cocaine and amphetamines.  Trafficking in illegal drugs is very
serious criminal activity even when done for a very brief period of time, on only an occasional basis. 
In this case, Applicant had been selling illegal drugs regularly for at least three years before she was
arrested in October 1989.  The seriousness of her crime is reflected in the 20 year prison sentence
adjudged by the court.  While she actually served only a year in prison, she will be on supervised
probation for another four years.</P>

<P>	Applicant receives little benefit from the mitigating conditions identified in the Adjudicative
Guidelines.  Although her arrest occurred almost eight years ago, Applicant's conduct is not
mitigated </P>

<P>by the time that has passed because she stands convicted of very serious criminal activity.  Applicant
voluntarily participated in the regular--as often as daily--sale and distribution of dangerous illegal
drugs for an extended period of time.  As a consequence, she will be on supervised probation for
another four years--after having already served several years of probation.  The Appeal Board has
ruled that "the more serious or long-term an applicant's conduct is, the stronger the evidence of
rehabilitation needs to be to...overcome the negative security implications of that conduct."  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 94-1055 (May 8, 1996) at page 4).  Evidence of Applicant's rehabilitation is marred
by her violating the conditions of probation less than two years ago.  Her failure to comply with the
requirements of her probation caused her to serve an additional 60 days in prison and now casts
considerable doubt on the success of her rehabilitation.</P>

<P>	Finally, it is difficult to determine if Applicant is now an acceptable security risk.  Before
her arrest and incarceration, Applicant--as a user and seller of drugs--was certainly not suitable to
hold a security  clearance.  More recently, there is evidence that she has become a responsible and
law abiding member of society.  She has a job, and no longer uses or trafficks in illegal drugs.  But
Applicant is also serving a sentence of supervised probation.<A HREF="96-0607.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Requirements of her probation include
regularly reporting to a probation officer and submitting to random urinalysis. Under these
circumstances, it is not possible to know whether Applicant has turned over a new leaf and is really
a new, different and improved version of her former self, or whether her recent, exemplary behavior
is a short-term, contrived strategy to comply with the requirements of probation in order to avoid
going back to jail.  This Administrative Judge cannot be confident that Applicant will be reliable and
trustworthy in an unguarded moment when much of her behavior has been--and will continue to
be-- subject to the scrutiny of a probation officer and random urinalysis.  Criterion J is concluded
against Applicant.</P>
