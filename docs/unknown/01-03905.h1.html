<P>Applicant's failure to unequivocally state that he will not use marijuana in the future precludes application of Mitigating Condition 3. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>On August 17, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 4, 2001, and elected to have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case on or about January 22, 2002. Applicant did not file a response to the Government's written case. The case 
was received by the undersigned Administrative Judge on March 11, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is forty-one years of age and is employed as a technician by a defense contractor.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times two times a week, from approximately January 1990 to at least May 2000. In a signed, sworn 
statement that he gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in July 2000, he stated that under the laws of the foreign country where he is residing, it is legal to 
use marijuana because "in (his) off time (he is) a member of a band."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to SOR Paragraph 1a, applicant stated that he "no longer" uses drugs. In response to SOR Paragraph 1b, which alleged that applicant "may continue 
to use marijuana in the future," applicant stated: "I admit that in paragraph 1b that I may continue to use marijuana in the future because I believe under (foreign 
country) law I am entitled to use marijuana since I was a musician. I am no longer a band member, because I need to concern my self with the job that I have 
and my future at (his current employer)."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following conditions are applicable:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigating Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that reasonably suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard 
classified information. If the Government meets its burden, it has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case. Once the Government establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case, the 
burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation, extenuation, mitigation or reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the 
Government's<EM> prima facie case</EM>, he or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the Directive's requirement that a security clearance 
be granted only upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government established a<EM> prima facie </EM>case under Guideline H. The evidence establishes that applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, 
at times twice weekly, from  approximately January 1990 to at least May 2000. Applicant's use of marijuana reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness, and reasonably suggests that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to rebut the Government's<EM> prima facie </EM>case under Guideline H. His various statements made in response to the SOR,  when viewed together, 
seem to indicate that he is not using marijuana at the present time,<A HREF="01-03905.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> but do not unequivocally commit him to abstaining from the use of marijuana in the future. 
Applicant's inability or unwillingness to unequivocally state he will not use marijuana in the future precludes application of Mitigating Condition 3. Based on 
the foregoing, I conclude that it is not now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant's clearance request.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Beacuse the evidence does not establish that applicant is currently using marijuana, I conclude that 10 U.S.C. 986 does not apply.
