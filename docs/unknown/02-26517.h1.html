<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On October 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which
is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E (personal
conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, dated
October 14, 2003, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing. 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the then sole SOR allegation alleged under Guideline
E.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 21, 2004, that
was mailed to Applicant January 23, 2004. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM, dated
February 22, 2004, that contained a series of e-mails as enclosures. Department Counsel executed
a memorandum dated March 2, 2004 indicating she did not object to Applicant's responses. The case
was assigned to me March 22, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Consistent with the authority granted to me by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,
Enclosure 3 (Additional Procedural Guidance), paragraph E3.1.17, I amended the SOR by adding
an allegation under Guideline J. Notice of the amendment was served upon Department Counsel and
Applicant.<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Department Counsel was given to May 13, 2004, and Applicant to May 27, 2004 to file
any additional information they wanted considered in light of the amendment. Department Counsel
filed a Supplemental File of Relevant Material on May 13, 2004. Applicant did not respond to the
Notice or otherwise submit any additional information for consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is a 30-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as a software
engineer since September 2000. He graduated from college in August 2000, and was previously
employed as an electrician from July 1996 to March 2000. He has been married since July 1996, and
has one 3-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was charged with Rape and Sodomy I on October 22, 1993. The charges were
based upon him sexually abusing his sister from 1985 to 1991. He pleaded guilty to reduced charges
(two counts) of sexual abuse on June 9, 1994, and was sentenced to 10 years,<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 3 years confinement,
and 5 years probation on each count. Applicant was sentenced as a youthful offender under the
applicable state statute,<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and is therefore not deemed to have been convicted of a crime.<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant
was actually confined in a penal institution from June 1994 to May 1995, and thereafter served one
year of supervised probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant provided a statement to a special agent for the Defense Investigative Service on
May 22, 2002 in which he stated the charges arose from "inappropriate sexual conduct" between him
and his sister that began in 1985. He also asserted in that statement that "The behavior was by mutual
consent." The Security Clearance Application (SF 86) he submitted on September 6, 2001<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> indicates
he had one sister living at the time he commenced the series of sexual acts that led to him being
charged with Rape and Sodomy I. That sister became six years old on November 1, 1985.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  	Applicant failed to disclose the above charges in the September 6, 2001 SF 86. Specifically,
he answered "NO" to question 21: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Felony Offenses - Have you ever been
charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice.) For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been
"sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is for
certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an
expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. </EM>Applicant has
consistently maintained the reason he answered the questioned incorrectly is because the computer
program would not allow him to enter a correct answer because the charges occurred more than
seven years before he prepared the SF 86.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's
eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and
Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the
Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever
a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline
E, pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, with their 
respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant deliberately provided a false answer in the SF 86 he submitted in an attempt to
conceal his criminal history. The explanation he provided to the special agent, in his answer to the
SOR, and in his response to the FORM, namely: the computer program would not allow him to input
a correct answer, is not credible. The question he falsified does not have a seven-year limitation, and
it is unbelievable that the program chose to impose such a limitation without Applicant calling it to
anyone's attention.<A HREF="02-26517.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Further, Applicant personally signed the SF 86 on March 4, 2002, certified his
answers were true and correct, and thus was clearly provided with the opportunity to change any
incorrect information contained in the SF 86.   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and none apply in this case.
Specifically, I again note Applicant provided false information to a special agent, in his answer to
the SOR, and in his response to the FORM. He has done nothing to correct that false information,
and instead continues to blame his false answer on a computer program mistake. Guideline E is
decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>	</EM>Criminal conduct under Guideline J is a security concern because a history or pattern of
criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's
secrets.  A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break rules.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was adjudicated a youthful offender based upon his commission of sexual offenses
against his sister who was no more than six years old when the conduct began. Rape and Sodomy
I charges were filed against him after he confided in his parents what he had been doing and then
turned himself into authorities. DC1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally charged</EM> and DC2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser
offenses </EM>apply in this case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>.  </EM></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Although Applicant's criminal conduct continued for approximately six years, there is no
indication he has repeated that conduct since 1991. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The
criminal behavior was recent</EM> applies. I have considered the remaining mitigating conditions and find
that none apply. There is no indication Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing the acts,
and while the applicable state law mandates that he be deemed to not have been convicted of an
offense, he was not acquitted. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The SF 86 Applicant executed on March 4, 2002 states just above his signature that "a
knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both."
Despite being advised of the criminality of making a deliberate and false statement, Applicant chose
to do just that. Further, Applicant outrageously asserted in the statement he provided on May 22,
2002 that the sexual activity with his six-year-old sister was consensual. I cannot find criminal
activity is unlikely to recur or there is evidence of successful rehabilitation in view of the recent false
explanations he has provided alleging consensual sexual activity with a tender age child and his
falsification of the SF 86. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Considering all of the evidence, including the whole person factors, and with particular note
be given to the recent fabrications he has made in support of his security clearance application, I find
the mitigating condition is substantially outweighed by the disqualifying conditions. Accordingly,
Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P>
