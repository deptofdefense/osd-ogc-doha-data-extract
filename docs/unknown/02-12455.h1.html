<P>Applicant's history of drug involvement and minor criminal conduct that occurred primarily during his high school years has been mitigated due to passage of 
time and positive significant life changes.  His subsequent marriage ended in a costly separation and divorce that precipitated a series of financial problems that 
have been mitigated by payment or payment arrangements.  Personal conduct concerns arose over a discrepancy of past drug use, which Applicant demonstrated 
was an inadvertent error.  Applicant has successfully mitigated drug involvement, criminal conduct, financial considerations, and personal conduct concerns.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 3, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-12455.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 24, 2004, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me April 1, 2005.  On April 8, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered five documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.  The Applicant offered one 
document, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A.  I left the record open after the hearing to afford Applicant the opportunity to 
submit additional documents.  The Applicant submitted five additional documents, which were admitted without objection as AE B through AE F.  DOHA 
received the transcript on May 27, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 30-year-old divorced man, who has two sons, ages 13 and 10.  Applicant provides support for his  two sons, who live with Applicant's ex-wife.  
He married in September 1995, separated in 1999, and divorced in September 2000.  GE 1, Tr. 51-52.  Applicant dropped out of high school in his junior year 
and earned his GED in August 1998.  He has completed approximately 15 credit hours of college course work.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since November 1998, Applicant has been employed as a security officer for a defense contractor.  He has never held a security clearance, however, he seeks a 
clearance to enhance his employment potential.  Applicant has held several jobs since May 1993, to include security guard, welder, sales representative, and 
security guard.  GE 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana approximately once or twice a week from approximately 1991 to 1994, SOR &para; 1.a.  Applicant stated, "As far as use of illegal drugs, I 
have smoked marijuana, mostly before moving to [current town] in 1995.  I might have smoked once or twice a week during my high school years.  I purchased 
small amounts of marijuana for my own use."  Signed, sworn statement, dated May 15, 2000, GE 3, p. 2, Tr. 18-19.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant sold cocaine once in approximately 1994, SOR &para; 1.b.  In May, 2000, he stated, "I once sold a little bit of cocaine, around 1994, for about $20.00 
because I needed the money.  My father found out about it, and that was the last time I ever did that."  GE 3, p. 2, Tr. 18-19.  Applicant was approximately 19-years-old at the time of this offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 8, 1995, Applicant was arrested for possession of a controlled dangerous substance (marijuana).  He plead guilty and received a two month 
suspended sentence and six months probation, SOR &para; 1.c.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 18-19, 24-25.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1995 and 1999, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately once every 6 to 12 months, SOR &para; 1.d.  Applicant stated, "Since 1995, I have smoked 
marijuana once every six months to a year, when friends light up and share with me.  I don't exactly recall when I last smoked - maybe early last year."  GE 3, 
p; 2, Tr. 18-19.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After Applicant's arrest for possession of marijuana, he was required to submit to drug testing during his six months of probation.  Tr. 24-25.  Additionally, 
Applicant has been employed as a security officer for the last seven years and during that time has been randomly drug-tested with negative results.  Response 
to SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Applicant is in arrears on nine debts.  The table below presents details about the debts alleged in the SOR, their current status, and cites to

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes his financial problems to his separation and divorce, and working in low paying jobs.  Applicant and his wife separated in 1999.  She 
moved out of the marital home with her three children born of a previous marriage and the two children born of her marriage to Applicant.  As a result of costs 
associated with a separation and child support, Applicant fell behind on his house payments, and the bank foreclosed.  Since being employed and experiencing a 
stable environment, Applicant's financial situation has improved and he is current on his debts.  Tr. 53-65.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 20, 1994, Applicant was arrested for disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, and assault and battery.  On September 8, 1994, these charges were nol 
prossed, SOR &para; 3.a.  Applicant stated, ". . . the charge resulted in my attempts to defend my girlfriend (later my wife), from contact with an abusive ex-boyfriend.  I was 19 years old at the time."  Response to SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with writing checks for insufficient funds in an amount exceeding $1,000.00.  Applicant negotiated a payment plan 
for these debts, SOR &para; 3.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 16, 2003, Applicant responded to a DOHA Interrogatory and stated his last use of marijuana was 1994 or 1995.  When interviewed earlier by the 
Defense Security Service (DSS) on March 15, 2000, he stated since 1995, he smoked marijuana once every six months to a year, ending in approximately 1999, 
SOR &para; 4.a.  Applicant denied he intentionally tried to deceive the government.  He responded, "Okay.  Well, that was an error on my behalf.  I had smoke (sic) 
real heavy marijuana between like '91 and '95.  After that, I was completely sober.  I hadn't smoked no marijuana, except like once or twice during the year, 
probably in 1998, and, I mean, during that time, you know, it was a very stressful time, and I did forget about that.  So, there really wasn't an every-day use for 
me.  I just considered me being stopped, completely stopped, in '94 or '95, during that time."  Tr. 24.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding his past drug involvement, arrests and financial problems, Applicant stated, "I certainly admit that my past was not perfect.  However, I would offer 
that my drug use was at a time in my life when I was young, immature, and lacking direction.  I am not the same person now.  Likewise, I incurred the debt as a 
very young adult, working at low paying jobs.  My divorce contributed to my bad financial situation."  Response to SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since, November 1998, Applicant has been steadily employed as a Security Officer assigned to positions of trust and responsibility.  During this time, he has 
maintained an excellent employment record.  Response to SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA listed four allegations under drug involvement (SOR &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.d.) to include marijuana use, selling a user amount of cocaine one 
time during high school, and being arrested for possession of marijuana.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A8.1.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline H in part by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted for each of the allegations contained in the 
SOR under &para; 1.  There is no doubt that Applicant's involvement with drugs caused him considerable problems in the past.  However, his involvement with 
drugs was primarily limited to a time-frame of 1991 to 1995, mostly during his high school years.  Such conduct gives rise to Drug Involvement Disqualifying 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Condition (DI DC) &para; E2.A.8.1.2.1. <EM>(Any drug abuse);</EM>and DI DC &para; E2.A8.1.2.2.<EM> (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacturer, 
purchase, sale, or distribution).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Fortunately, as Applicant matured, married, became a father, and found responsible employment, his drug involvement ceased and he has been drug-free for at 
least seven years.  Although serious, his one-time sale of a user amount of cocaine in approximately 1994 occurred when he was in high school and was 
effectively dealt with by his father.  He self-reported this drug involvement to DSS during the security clearance process.  There is no evidence of further 
distribution offenses other than this one-time offense, which occurred approximately 11 years ago. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since working for his current employer, Applicant has been randomly drug tested with negative results for seven years.  Applicable mitigating conditions as a 
result of Applicant's turnaround behavior are Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) &para; E2.A8.1.3.1. <EM>(The drug involvement was not recent); </EM>and DI 
C &para; E2.A8.1.3.3. <EM>(A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future).  </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has nine delinquent debts (SOR &para;&para; 2.a. through 2.i.).  <EM>The Concern: </EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at 
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline F by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted for each of the allegations contained in the SOR 
under &para; 2.  His inability to satisfy his outstanding financial obligations gives rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>(A 
history of not meeting financial obligations); </EM>and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As reflected above, Applicant submitted evidence at his hearing and after his hearing that he has paid or resolved all debts alleged.  Applicant experienced 
several events that severely impacted his financial standing and ability to remain current on his debts.  His financial situation deteriorated after going through a 
separation, divorce, maintaining two households, paying child support, and being employed in low paying jobs.  Applicant has striven to advance in status and 
pay and has undertaken tangible steps to get his past debts behind him.  These actions trigger Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 
E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>(The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, . . . , divorce 
or separation); </EM>and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  </EM>Applicant's 
demonstrated actions affirm his commitment to return to financial stability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged two allegations under criminal conduct (SOR &para;&para; 3.a. and b.) to include a 1994 arrest for disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, 
and assault and battery, and a 1997 arrest for writing checks on insufficient funds.  Neither arrest resulted in a conviction.  The 1994 arrest was nol prossed and 
Applicant negotiated a payment plan for the 1997 arrest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline J by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted for each of the allegations contained in the SOR 
under &para; 3.  Such conduct gives rise to Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>(Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged)</EM>.  Due to the passage of time and turnaround of Applicant's life Criminal Conduct Mitigating 
Conditions (CC MC) E1.A10.1.3.1. <EM>(The criminal behavior was not recent)</EM>; and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. <EM>(There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) 
</EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA listed one allegation under personal conduct (&para; 4.a.), that Applicant provided two varying answers regarding past marijuana use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns are Applicant's differing accounts of his past marijuana usage.  The SOR alleged Applicant's response to DOHA 
Interrogatories in 2003 varied from the account he gave to DSS when interviewed in 2000.  Specifically, the 2003 response indicated his last use of marijuana 
was in 1994 or 1995.  By contrast his 2000 response indicated that since 1995, he smoked marijuana once every six months to a year, ending in approximately 
1999.  Applicant credibly testified on this point and denied he intentionally tried to deceive the government.  His explanation was that his frequent use of 
marijuana ended in 1994 or 1995 and his very infrequent use may have occurred once every six months to a year ending in approximately 1999.  His differing 
account, however, is attributable to memory lapse and uncertainty over frequent use versus infrequent use.  While Applicant could reasonably have been 
expected to be more diligent when responding to these inquiries, his judgment lapses are not enough to impute knowing and wilful falsification under Guideline 
E.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations of his varying responses to past marijuana usage are persuasive enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission.  There 
being no misconduct substantiated, no need to show extenuation and mitigation arises.  Applicant put the government on notice regarding past marijuana usage, 
and little could be gained from a wilful misrepresentation in this regard.  His failure to exercise greater diligence in reconciling these discrepancies which 
covered a significant portion of his early life is sufficient to refute the allegation of falsification covered in subparagraph 4.a. by Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In short, Applicant's early life stands in sharp contrast to the person he is today.  He has been drug-free for at least seven years, has not been involved with law 
enforcement for at least eight years, is well on the road to financial recovery, and is gainfully employed as a security officer in a position of trust and 
responsibility.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of the circumstances to include his documented actions coupled with his credible testimony, I find for Applicant on SOR &para; 1 and &para;&para; 1.a.
