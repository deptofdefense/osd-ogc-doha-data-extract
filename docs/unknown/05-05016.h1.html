<P>Applicant had debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1992 and 2002. In 2006, he filed a Chapter 13 wage earner's plan that his attorney has advised him to convert it to another Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his financial condition. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. In accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 
1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 27 April 2006 detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the 
Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 25 May 2006 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 19 July 2006. On 15 November 
2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I kept the record open until 27 November 
2006 so Applicant could make copies of original documents he wanted submitted as exhibits. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 29 November 2006. Applicant did not submit the 
documents. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old assembly technician for a defense contractor. He has worked for that contractor for almost 22 years and has held a Secret clearance since August 2002. He has been 
commended and given awards for his job performance. This review of his security clearance was initiated when he reported his recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is divorced (21 February 2006) and has three children--20, 19, and 16 years old. Two of his children will be entering the U.S. military.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 1992 and August 2002. Applicant asserts the first bankruptcy resulted from an unusual amount of medical expenses, his brother 
stopped making payments on a loan that Applicant cosigned, and he and his wife had trouble controlling their credit card debts. Ex. 2 at 1. The 2002 bankruptcy was caused by their debts "getting to 
the point where [they] could not handle the payments." <EM>Id.</EM> </P> 
 
<P>In February 2003, when interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), Applicant claimed that he and his wife were working to get their finances straightened out. They had 
destroyed all of their credit cards. He had not received counseling, but promised to do so if he found himself in financial trouble again. In a personal financial statement he submitted with his 
February 2003 statement, Applicant reported no debts that were then delinquent and a monthly remainder of $897. <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed financial interrogatories in March 2005. He reported that he had initiated a divorce, that his wife had assumed the mortgage, and that he was not delinquent on any debts. 
Neither he nor his wife was represented by an attorney during the divorce. Applicant was on disability at the time, but expected to return to work later that month. Ex. 3 at 4.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy wage-earners' plan in March 2006. Applicant claimed his ex-wife had failed to make payments on the house that was still in his name. He couldn't afford to 
make the payments, so he had to seek the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the lender foreclosed on the house two weeks before the hearing. Tr. 22. Applicant is currently paying, with the help 
of his ex-wife,  $403 a month on the wage earner's plan. His bankruptcy attorney has advised him to convert the Chapter 13 into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Tr. 23. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant had his 2005 tax returns prepared by a commercial tax preparer. But the tax preparer will not release the tax returns for Applicant to file with the IRS, until Applicant pays for the service. 
Applicant believes the debt alleged in &para; 1.f for $787 is listed in the Chapter 13. He has not paid the $70 he owes to a video rental company (&para; 1.e).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant currently lives with his parents. He doesn't pay rent, but he pays all the utilities and helps them purchase medications. He denies ever going to a credit counseling service. Tr. 35-36. Yet 
his bankruptcy attorney submitted a credit counseling certificate to the bankruptcy court on 8&nbsp;March 2006. Ex. 4 at 2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. 
The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security 
guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR 
Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1992 (&para; 1.c) and 2002 (&para; 1.b), and filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2006 (&para; 1.a); had an 
account for $8,952 that was past due more than 120 days (&para; 1.d); an account for $70 that was placed for collection (&para; 1.e); and a debt of $787 that was past due more than 60 days (&para;&nbsp;1.f). In his 
Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, except for &para; 1.d.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1. The Government's evidence established potentially disqualifying 
conditions under Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3). On three occasions 
in the last 14 years Applicant has had to resort to bankruptcy to resolve his debts. Although he is currently making $403 payments on his Chapter 13, his attorney advised him to convert it to a 
Chapter 7. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Applicant may mitigate financial considerations security concerns by establishing that the behavior was not recent (MC E2.A6.1.3.1); it was an isolated incident (MC E2.A6.1.3.2); the financial 
situation was largely beyond the applicant's control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3); the person has received counseling and there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under control (MC 
E2.A6.1.3.4); or the applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC E2.A6.1.3.6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of Applicant's financial difficulties originally arose due to unforeseen medical debts. Applicant established MC E2.A5.1.3.3, at least for the first bankruptcy. But these debts were discharged 
as a result of his 1992 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant was given an opportunity to start over financially. It is not clear whether Applicant ever actually received any credit counseling. Regardless, 
he has not established that his debts are being resolved or that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk." Directive &para; E2.2.1. It 
involves "the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept." <EM>Id.</EM> An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) 
the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been experiencing financial problems over the past 14 years. He doesn't seem to be able to get them resolved. He is now talking about converting his Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. He admits he still owes $70 on a debt that was placed for collection in 2003. Despite the longevity of his current employment, I am unable to conclude this 41-year-old Applicant has 
mitigated the financial security concerns alleged against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.d:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.f:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.</P>
