<P>The Applicant has surrendered his Nigerian passport to the proper authorities and it has been cancelled.  He has also renounced his Nigerian citizenship.  His foreign ties pose no security risk. 
Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should 
be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 10, 2006, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on September 8, 
2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 22, 2006, scheduling the hearing for October 30, 2006.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented ten 
exhibits and  testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of four 
pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on November 13, 2006.</P> 
 
<P>On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, clarifying "the application of 
Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  The Applicant received a copy of this memorandum with the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 2).  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 25 years of age and holds a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.  
He is employed as a Software Engineer.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference 
for another country over the United States.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States.   He was born in Lagos, Nigeria in 1981.  His mother won the lottery for a green card under the Diversity Program sponsored by 
the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.  The green card entitled his mother, her spouse and each of her children under the age of twenty-one to receive permanent residence visas 
in the United States if they so chose.  The visas will expire in 2008.  The Applicant took advantage of his visa and moved to the United States in May 1998, at the age of sixteen.  He became a 
United States citizen on February 11, 2005.  He currently possesses a United States passport that will expire in 2010.   </P> 
 
<P>On August 15, 2005, when the Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Defense Security Service, he stated that he also possessed a Nigerian passport that was issued on September 
13, 2000, and was renewed in about May 2004.  This passport was scheduled to expire in September 11, 2010.  The Applicant had planned to use his Nigerian passport in order to travel to Nigeria 
to visit family members there.  Since moving to the United States in 1998, the Applicant has traveled to Nigeria on one occasion.  When he did,  he used both his United States passport and his 
Nigerian passport to enter and exit the country.     </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant believes that he renounced his Nigerian citizenship when he took the oath to become a United States citizen.  (Tr. p. 56).  However, after learning of the provisions of the Money 
emorandum, he went a step further and renounced his Nigerian citizenship and surrendered his Nigerian passport by making a formal request by letter to the passport office at the Federal Ministry 
of Internal Affairs in Nigeria on October 12, 2006.  (Applicant's Exhibit A).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's mother, father, and a brother are all citizens and residents of Nigeria.  His parents and sisters all hold United States permanent resident alien status cards that will expire in 2008.  
His eldest brother, who does not have a permanent resident alien status card will stay in Nigeria.  His parents are planning to move to the United States, soon.  The Applicant contacts his parents in 
Nigeria about once or twice a month and on holidays.  (Tr. p. 49).  He has little or no contact with his eldest brother.  </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's father is a retired civil servant who worked for the Ministry of Defense in Nigeria over ten years ago.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).  Prior to that, he worked in the Office of the Head of 
the Civil Service of the Federation, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Labor and Productivity. Since retiring from government service, he has had no contact with the Nigerian 
government.  His father receives a small pension from the Nigerian government, however, it is the money from his mother's business that provides most of their financial support.  (Applicant's 
Exhibit D and E).  </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's mother is a travel agent and owns her own business.  <EM>(</EM>Applicant's Exhibit B and C).  The Applicant's brother is an accountant for a private bank in Nigeria.  His sisters have already 
moved to the United States and reside here.  One of them is an accountant, the other is a student currently in the process of applying to graduate school.  One of his sister's is already a United States 
citizen.  </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's parents own the house that they live in.  Under Nigerian law, when they move to the United States, the Applicant's eldest brother will inherit the property. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>Letters from the Applicant's father confirms his past employment with the Nigerian government.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits G and H).</P> 
 
<P>Letters from the Applicant's Supervisor, his Manager, and the Facility Security Officer collectively indicate that the Applicant is highly regarded for his intelligence, motivation, and integrity.  He is 
a strong team player and has been promoted as a result of his outstanding work performance.  He is also an individual with high moral standards.  He is considered trustworthy, very responsible and 
extremely conscientious about his work.  (Applicant's Exhibit J). </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or 
mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent 
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  
Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful 
to the interests of the United States.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens 
of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P>3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</P> 
 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</P> 
 
<P>a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number 
of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   
The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P>The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a 
rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P> 
 
<P>Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely to be 
repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The 
mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes that 
the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States who possessed a Nigerian passport.  Disqualifying Conditions, <EM>(1) The exercise of dual citizenship </EM>and<EM> (2) Possession and/or use 
of a foreign passport</EM> apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions  <EM>(1) Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country </EM>and <EM>(4)  Individual has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship </EM>are applicable<EM>.</EM></P> 
 
<P>Since learning that possession of a foreign passport is not permitted when holding a security clearance, in compliance with the provisions of the Money Memorandum, he surrendered his foreign 
passport to the Nigerian authorities.  He has also renounced his Nigerian citizenship.  Under the circumstances, the Applicant has done everything possible to be in compliance with the requirements 
of the directive and the Money Memorandum.  Accordingly, he has clearly demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find for the 
Applicant under Guideline C. </P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Disqualifying Condition <EM>(1) an immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM> applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions <EM>(1)  A determination that the immediate family member(s), 
(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the person(s) involved and the United States </EM>and<EM> (3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM> are 
applicable.  The Applicant's two sisters have already moved to the United States.  One has already become a United States citizen.  The other will apply to be one as soon as she is eligible.  The 
Applicant's parents are planning to move to the United States in the very near future.  His only family member who will remain in Nigeria is his brother.  The Applicant has little or not contact with 
him.  </P> 
 
<P>Although the Applicant's father was at one time employed with the Nigerian Government,  he is now retired and has been for over ten years.  He receives a small pension from the Nigerian 
Government but receives no financial support of any kind from the Applicant.  The Applicant's father is planning to move to the United States to make it his permanent home.  The Applicant's 
father is no longer associated with the Nigerian government, or is he in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or in a position to be exploited by the Nigerian Government in a way 
that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to him and loyalty to the United States.  Except for his brother who will remain in Nigeria, the Applicant has for the most part cut all ties 
with Nigeria.  The Applicant understands his responsibility to the United States in holding a security clearance.  Based on the foregoing, the Applicant's relative does not raise a security concern and 
Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   </P> 
 
<P>Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline C and B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met 
his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C and B.</P>
