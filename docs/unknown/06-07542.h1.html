<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had four debts alleged in the statement of reasons (SOR). </SPAN> Her debt problems resulted primarily from two divorces and the failure of her former spouses to provide adequate financial 
support to her and her two children. She received financial counseling. She paid one debt. Collection of her three remaining delinquent SOR debts is barred by the 3-year South Carolina statute of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) refers to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, and DoD Directive 
5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve 
contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  Department Counsel made a motion to delete all references to the Regulation, and Applicant had no objection to this change to her SOR 
(R. 11).  I granted Department Counsel's motion (R. 11-12), but note that the aggravating and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive for this case are substantially the same.  
oreover, paragraph C8.2.1 of the Regulation provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>On August 16, 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On May 8, 2006, DOHA issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive and 
Regulation.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),  Guideline E (Personal Conditions), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on June 27, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  On August 31, 2006, in a separate letter, she elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 
2006, the case was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 3, 2006.  At the hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional 
documentary evidence (R. 49; Ex. G). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (R.) on November 28, 2006, and I received it on December 4, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to my 
consideration of the evidence Applicant provided, and I admitted her additional evidence (Ex. H) on January 22, 2007.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she or her husband were responsible for the four debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  She thought a debt consolidation company (DCC) 
had paid two debts, was unsure of the amount owed on one account, and thought her former husband was supposed to pay one debt.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 39 years old (R. 4).<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> For the last 12 years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>   She has 
access to social security numbers and other private information (R. 6-7). She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has a high school diploma (R. 4).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was married in 1987, and has two children from that marriage (born in 1988 and 1994).<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She was divorced between 1993 and 1997 (R. 26).  Her first husband often failed to pay his court 
ordered child support (R. 20-21; Ex C).  She married again in 2000, and is now divorced (R. 26).  Before she married her second husband, he said he did not have credit and paid cash for everything 
(R. 29).  Later, she received a credit report indicating he had credit problems (R. 29).  Her second husband agreed to provide financial support after they were separated (R. 18).  However, after six 
months of separation, he discontinued his financial support to her (R. 18).  </P>

The balance owed after the auction of her mobile home was $18,502 (R. 33).</SPAN></P>

basis for child support (R. 39-40).  Her monthly net pay after deductions is $2,030.  She listed monthly household expenses of $2,030 per month as follows:  rent ($620), groceries ($355), clothing 
($20), utilities ($250), car expenses ($450), insurance ($75), after school care ($160), and miscellaneous ($100).  She did not list any other debt payments or other liabilities.  After deducting all 
expenses, she had a positive cash flow of 30 cents per month.  The car expense of $450 per month in the PFS includes money for possible car repairs and her monthly payment to repay her 401(k) 
account, which she used to finance the purchase of a car (R. 37-38).  Her son graduated from high school in June 2006, and just started a new job (R. 38).  He lives in her home and should be able to 
contribute to the household expenses (R. 38).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant said no payments were made on her SOR debts for four years (R. 41), and she was unable to make payments in the near future towards her debts because she expected to receive less child 
support now that her son had completed high school (R. 39).  She intended to resolve her delinquent debts using bankruptcy (R. 41-42).  Her agreement with her bankruptcy attorney specifies 
payment of a basic fee of $1500 and $299 court costs, which must to be paid before the case is filed in court (Ex. A at 15).  Applicant paid her attorney $800 on November 19, 2006 (Ex. G at 5). A 
memorandum from her financial counselor documents the financial counseling she received in January 2007 (Ex. H at 2).   </SPAN></P>

<P>Question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P asks, "<STRONG>YOUR FINANCIAL RECORD </STRONG> Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations funded or 
guaranteed by the Federal Government."  Applicant answered, "No."  SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 3.a allege that this answer is false.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's February 4, 2005, statement to an OPM special investigator stated, "I did not list [delinquent debt] accounts on my [SF 85P] because I did not understand the questions. I only thought 
the questions concerned filing for bankruptcy?" (Ex. 2 at 2).  In her response to the SOR, Applicant said, "I misunderstood the question, or I would have listed everything." (Ex. 9 at 1, 4).  She 
reiterated her answer, "I admit I did not fill out the paperwork correctly now - I misunderstood the question.  Otherwise I would have put everything down."  (Ex. 9 at 2, 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing, Applicant changed her explanation for failing to disclose her delinquent debts on her 2004 SF 85P, and instead indicated that she believed DCC had paid the debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 
1.a and 1.b.  It is necessary, therefore, to discuss her statement at her hearing and her relationship with DCC in detail.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following colloquy between Department Counsel and Applicant provides her explanation for answering, "No" to Question 22b:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  Okay.  Let's go to the financial statement, excuse me, the SF 85P.  Now, in your Answer you said that you misunderstood the question.  What did you misunderstand?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Just - on question 22, it says, in the last seven years, have you or your company ever been - you or your company over which you exercise some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared 
bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien or have legal judgment rendered against you for a debt.  And I read it literally.  I did not at that time file bankruptcy.  In my mind all I had in my mind was 
repossession, and it does not discuss repossession here.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  What about 22(b)?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  As far as being - it says are you now over 180 days delinquent on a loan or financial obligation. At this point in time, my thinking was that [the debt consolidation company (DCC)] would end up 
taking care of my credit, and I wasn't behind on anything.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  Okay.  When was the last time that you had checked on DCC?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Honestly?  I haven't - I tried calling, you know, previously, of getting the letter from the Trade Commission.  But after my ex-husband had given me the letter from the Trade Commission saying 
that they had shut them down, there was no way of contacting them, I thought.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  Okay.  And when were you aware that they were shut down?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  I want to say it was in like January of - all right.  The letter was in September of 2002 from the Federal Trade Commission.  Documentation had to be in by November the 30<SUP>th</SUP> - it was January of 
2003 before he gave me this letter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  So in 2003 you were aware that there were problems with DCC?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Right.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  And you filled our your SF 85P in August of 2004, correct?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Correct, but at that point in time I still did not know that they had not - I had not had a credit report pulled, [I] did not know that DCC had not [taken] care of what I asked them to take care of.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  When you found out that they had been shut down did you do anything to check on the status of your accounts?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  No.  I - the van  - I had asked for my van and trailer to be taken from me, and I didn't have any reason to look for - at my credit report because I knew I couldn't - I am living on - if I don't 
have cash for it, then I don't need it, unless there's an emergency on my vehicle.  Then I have to borrow money from my 401(k) or my mother.  At the time that this all went on I probably could have 
gotten a hardship from my 401(k), but I didn't even know that was available.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(R. 34-36).  In her closing argument, Applicant stated, "As far as the - the form was concerned, like I stated previously I  - I clearly did not interpret the questions on the way that they were, I guess, 
intended to be done." (R. 49).  </SPAN>A detailed review of Applicant's involvement with DCC reveals that she was aware that DCC had not paid the debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her second husband decided to use DCC to improve their credit in order to  qualify to purchase a house (R. 29).  They understood that if they paid DCC $400 per month for two years 
all of their debt would be resolved (R. 29). Applicant made payments of $250 per month to DCC for about eight months, starting in December 2000 (R. 27-28).  During this period she  separated 
from her second husband, who had orally agreed to make payments to DCC (R. 27).  Her second husband stopped making payments, and Applicant contacted DCC and asked DCC to apply the 
money in reserve to the accounts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b (R. 27, 30).  She did not receive any response from DCC (R. 27). Her second husband gave her a letter from the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) stating the DCC was shut down (R. 28, 30).  After receiving the FTC letter, she did not hear from her creditors, and she did not contact her creditors, except for a recent letter from a non-SOR creditor (R. 30).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In her response to the SOR, Applicant provided an account statement from DCC, indicating DCC received seven payments of $250 in the period December 18, 2000 to June 15, 2001.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  For each 
payment, DCC charged $62.50 as a clearance fee.  Applicant said she thought she paid DCC more than the account statement indicates (R. 31).  However, she did not have any documentation from 
DCC showing a greater account balance (R. 31).  On June 18, 2001, DCC paid a non-SOR creditor $800, and $512.50 remained in her account.  DCC showed a balance for SOR accounts &para;&para; 1.a 
($635 owed with no settlement amount) and 1.b ($2,034 owed and an offer to settle dated September 12, 2001 for $875).  A letter from DCC seeking permission to settle and pay the debt in SOR &para; 
1.b was signed by Applicant and dated September 12, 2001 (provides the debt in SOR &para; 1.b was settled for $875 and $12.50 remained in her DCC account after deducting $875 (Ex. 8 at 8)).  A letter 
from DCC seeking permission to settle and pay a non-SOR debt was signed by Applicant and dated October 8, 2001 (states a non-SOR  debt was settled for $590 and $297 remained or would 
remain in her DCC account after deducting $590 (Ex. 8 at 10-11)).   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>A letter from Applicant to DCC, dated August 21, 2002, indicates she sent telefaxes and left messages in June and July 2002, asking DCC to provide the status of the settlement on the debt in SOR 
&para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and a non-SOR debt (Ex. 8 at 14, 15).  An undated subsequent letter from Applicant to DCC, states, "do what you can with [the SOR &para; 1.a debt], and send me a check for the balance in 
the trust account."  (Ex. 8 at 16).  Another letter from Applicant to DCC, in September 2002 indicates she wants proof that the SOR &para; 1.a debt has been paid, and the balance in the trust account 
(Ex. 8 at 17).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's response to the SOR contained a letter from the FTC indicating on August 20, 2002, DCC's assets were frozen, and on September 3, 2002, a receiver took over the distribution of DCC's 
assets.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The FTC letter notes that the liabilities of DCC greatly exceed its assets, and all customers of DCC should file a claim for any money DCC owes them.  The FTC letter states, "You should 
be aware that FTC's ongoing lawsuit against [DCC] does not affect your creditors' ability, or right, to collect any debt you owe."  Applicant provided a letter dated February 21, 2003, from the 
creditor for the debt in  SOR &para; 1.a offering to settle the debt of $1,623 for $860 (Ex. E).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Applicant knew that DCC had not in fact paid the delinquent debts alleged</SPAN> in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> when she signed her 2004 SF 85P.  Her statement at her hearing about her rationale for

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the 
Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its initial 
burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's 
case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  
Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The scope 
of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's failure to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial obligations," and FC DC 
3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debt in SOR &para; 1.d was paid.  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c became delinquent between 2000 and 2002, and remain unpaid.  The amount of debt 
in SOR &para; 1.c was actually $18,502 rather than $28,495, the amount alleged.             </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government 
produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating 
condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P><SUP></SUP>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all of her SOR debts because the debts became delinquent as the result of her first husband's failure to pay court ordered child support, and the failure of her second 
husband to fully honor his commitment to provide financial support.  These changes in family circumstances trigger application of FC MC 3, as they caused financial problems that may be "largely 
beyond the person's control."  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she has made insufficient financial progress by the time the record was closed on January 22, 
2007.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve her SOR debts over the last four years, especially after her OPM interview on February 4, 2005, made her aware 
of the security significance of her financial problems. </P> 
 
<P>She received financial counseling, and receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there are substantial indications that the problem is being resolved and she is gaining control of her financial 
situation.  In regard to application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, and payment of some funds to her attorney for a possible bankruptcy, FC MC 6 does not apply because there is 
insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts from 2002 to 2005.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Her involvement with DCC did not involve any attempt to resolve her 
largest debt.  Moreover, her total delinquent debts were over $22,000 and she paid DCC less than $2,000.  After learning that DCC had not paid her debts, she did not undertake any effort to pay the 
debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c.  Her actions in generating and failing to resolve her delinquent debts over the last four years are most relevant to security concerns relating to financial considerations, and 
weigh against mitigating financial considerations.   Financial considerations are also addressed in the "whole person" analysis, <EM>infra</EM>. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>       <SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is always a security concern because it asks whether a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Personal 
conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not 
properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 2, "the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire," 
and PC DC 4, "personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC DCs 2 and 4 apply because Applicant gave a false answer to Question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P.<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> 
<P>  At her hearing she said she thought that DCC had paid the delinquent debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 
1.a and 1.b.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Actually, she was well aware that DCC had not paid these two delinquent debts.  She had correspondence from the FTC, and a creditor indicating that DCC was not honoring its 
obligations to apply her payments to her debts.  Moreover, she sent correspondence to DCC that showed she did not believe that DCC had paid the delinquent debts alleged in </SPAN>SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     I have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC), but especially PC MC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1, the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of 
judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability," PC MC 2, "t<A NAME="cp220">he falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily," </A><A NAME="cp222">and PC 
C 5, "</A>the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial difficulties increased her vulnerability to pressure, and she deliberately failed to disclose her relevant, delinquent debts on her 2004 SF 85P.  No mitigating conditions apply.  She 
was not advised by anyone to omit information about her delinquent debts from her 2004 SF 85P. While her subsequent disclosure of her delinquent debts to an OPM investigator is a "positive step 
to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure," she was not candid at her hearing about why she failed to disclose the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">delinquent debts alleged in </SPAN>SOR &para;&para; 1.a 
and 1.b.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Her failure to be totally honest in connection with her 2004 SF 85P and at her 2006 hearing strikes at the very core of the trustworthiness determination. Her untruthful response on her 
2004 trustworthiness questionnaire is significant, and not mitigated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information and </SPAN>creates doubt about a person's judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness.    </P> 
 
<P>Two criminal conduct disqualifying conditions (CC DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  CC DC 1 applies where there are allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, "regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged" and CC DC 2 applies in situations where an applicant has committed "a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses." </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR </SPAN>&para; 3.a alleges that she violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by falsifying question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P.  As indicated previously, I find that she deliberately falsified her 2004 SF 85P.  For a violation of 
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 to occur, however, the falsification must be material.  The Supreme Court defined "materiality" in <EM>United States v. Gaudin</EM>, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995) as a statement having a 
"natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed."  <EM>See also United States v. McLaughlin</EM>, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).   If Applicant had provided an accurate answer to Question 22b of her SF 85P, this accurate answer is capable of influencing the government to deny her security clearance.  Her delinquent debts are 
sufficiently significant to jeopardize her security clearance application, and as such they  are material.  Accordingly, CC DCs 1 and 2 apply because Applicant committed a single serious offense, a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which is a felony.  </P> 
</A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN>Security concerns based on criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent (CC MC 1).  As indicated previously in the discussion of materiality under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, there are 
no "bright line" rules for determining when conduct is "recent."<A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  If the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge 
must determine whether that period of time demonstrates "changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation."  <EM>Id</EM>.  Applicant's only SOR-alleged incident of 
criminal conduct was her false statement, when she filled out her SF 85P on August 16, 2004.  However, the SOR allegation of criminal conduct must be considered along with all the other evidence 
when applying this mitigating condition.  She was not forthright and candid when addressing her culpability at her hearing on November 3, 2006.<SUP> </SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-07542.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Viewing her conduct as a whole, CC MC 1 does 
not apply. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct security concerns may be mitigated under CC MC 2 when the "crime was an isolated incident," or under CC MC 3 when an applicant demonstrates she "was pressured or coerced 
into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life."  CC MCs 2 and 3 do not apply because Applicant committed the 2004 falsification and then was not honest at 
her 2004 hearing when addressing the falsification, and no one caused her or influenced her to commit the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For CC MC 4, security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct may be mitigated when an applicant "did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to 
recur."  Applicant voluntarily committed the criminal conduct, and has not shown a sufficient track record of positive or non-criminal conduct.  CC MC 4 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In regard to CC MC 5, security concerns may be mitigated when "there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  CC MC 5 does not apply because there is a dearth of evidence about changes in 
her life that establish her successful rehabilitation.   </SPAN></P>

<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, her inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, and her false response on her 2004 SF 85P raise serious 
trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 39 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely 
fashion, and her falsification on her SF 85P were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> <SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts 
resulted from the failure of her former husbands to provide sufficient financial support.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated 
by self-discipline and the almost complete absence of new delinquent, unpaid debt over the last three years. Moreover, changes in her financial habits resulting from her financial counseling show signs 
of financial improvement in the future. </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress from her financial problems should decrease in the future, providing she applies the financial 
counseling she is receiving.  Moreover, Applicant was able to pay the debt in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">SOR &para; 1.d</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c are not collectible because of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations.  </SPAN><EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 (listing the statute of limitations for various debts);
