<P>Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. He has taken little action until recently to contact  the creditors and pay off his debts. Based on his

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 5, 2003</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on a 
hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 13, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on March 3, 2004, and the hearing was held on April 28, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 5), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 
three documentary exhibits,(Applicant Exhibits A through C) and  offered his own testimony. The record was left open for Applicant to offer additional 
documents to help clarify his position on some of the debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He submitted one document, a one page letter from the Department of Treasury, dated April 23, 
2004, which has been entered into evidence without objection as Exhibit D</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. The transcript (TR) was received on May 15, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains sixteen allegations, 1.a. through 1.p., under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b.,1.d., 1.n.,  
and 1.o. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49 year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He is married to his second wife, and he has two 
daughters, ages 26 and 20. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has received a GED, a high school equivalent degree. He served for 24 years in the United States Navy. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">T</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> lists a bankruptcy that was eventually filed by Applicant, 1.a. and  1.b, under Adjudicative Guideline F, and  fourteen  debts that Applicant owed as of 
June 6, 2003, 1.c. through 1.p, under Adjudicative Guideline F.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The bankruptcy and the debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. Applicant first petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1994, but the bankruptcy was dismissed in February 21, 1995.  His debts were not discharged at that 
time. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. Applicant again petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on February 28, 1995. This bankruptcy concluded on September 6, 2000, at which time his debts 
were discharged. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $446, for a state tax lien.  Applicant denied that there had ever been a tax lien against 
him, (TR at 31-33),  but Exhibit B, a report from a credit reporting service, establishes that there had been a tax lien against Applicant, and that it had been paid. 
I conclude that, despite Applicant's testimony, there was a tax lien but the amount of the lien has been satisfied.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $365.55. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this debt is due and owing. However, at the hearing he 
testified that this debt had been resolved (TR at 33-36). I find no evidence that he paid anything on this debt, and I conclude that, based on his RSOR admission, 
this debt has not been resolved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $4,370.16. Applicant first testified that he did not believe he had a credit card from this company or 
incurred this debt (TR at 36-39). In later testimony, he contradicted himself and stated that he did have a credit card for this company, but he believed that this 
debt was paid, and he was not responsible for this debt since it was no longer on his credit report (TR at 75-77). Based on his conflicting testimony, his failure 
to offer any evidence to show that he paid this debt, and the fact that a debt can drop off a credit report and may still be owed, I conclude that this debt has not 
been resolved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 4</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $716. In a signed, sworn statement Applicant made to the Defense Security Service 
(DSS) on September 18, 2001, Applicant stated regarding this debt, "I agree I owe the balance due and will begin to make monthly payments to the telephone 
company." (Exhibit2).  At the hearing he testified that he has made no payment on this debt </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 39-41). I have determined that he owes the entire amount 
stated. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 5</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $390.68. Applicant testified that he does not recognize or owe this debt </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 41, 
42).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Yet in Exhibit 2, Applicant stated regarding this debt,  " I contacted my daughter and discovered that veterinary services were rendered for my daughter's 
pet in 1995. I will contact this creditor to make arrangements to pay in full in monthly payments." Applicant has made no payment on this debt, and he currently 
owes the full amount stated</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $599. Applicant testified that he has made no payment on this debt. His version of the 
facts leading up to this debt are also less that consistent. In Exhibit 2, Applicant stated regarding this debt for an instructional course,  "When I wasn't able to 
receive additional assistance, I returned the books and cancelled the contract." At the hearing he first denied ever signing a contract or ever receiving any books</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
 Later he testified that he did receive some books but they were just an overview of the course </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 42-45). I conclude that he did sign a contract and did 
receive course materials. There is no way for me to determine if the terms of the contract gave him the legal right to cancel the contract, but  based on his 
inconsistent and multiple versions of the facts of this debt, and his failure to introduce evidence of his version of the facts, I consider him obligated for this debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $701</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant testified that he believed that this debt was discharged in bankruptcy 
(TR at 45, 46). Applicant's Petition in Bankruptcy does not include this creditor (Exhibit 4). I conclude that this debt is still due and owing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 8</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $380.  In Exhibit 2, Applicant stated regarding this debt, " . . .  I have never used a 
check cashing service although it's possible the my former spouse had used this service."   At the hearing, Applicant testified that he has not used this service 
and has made no payment on this debt. Since Applicant believed that the debt may have been incurred by his ex-wife when they were married, a debt for which 
he would be responsible, and he has not done anything to disprove that belief, I conclude that Applicant currently owes the full amount stated</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 9</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,009.  The Government has presented evidence and argued that this debt is the same 
as that listed in 1e. Applicant concurred that this is the same debt. I conclude that this is the same debt as in 1.e, and that Applicant does not owe this debt, only 
that listed in 1.e.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 10</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $423.  Applicant testified that he does not recognize or owe this debt </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 48)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The 
Government has presented as evidence  a credit report listing this debt (Exhibit 3). Based on the credit report and Applicant's less than complete memory 
regarding his debts, I conclude that Applicant does owe this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 11</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $530.  The Government has presented evidence and argued that this debt is the same 
as that listed in 1f. Applicant concurred that this is the same debt.  Since both debts are for the same phone company,  I conclude that this is the same debt as in 
1.f, and that Applicant does not owe this debt, only that listed in  1.f.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 12</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $71. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this debt is due and owing. At the hearing, he testified that he 
would be now be resolving this debt because he recently received verification that he owed this debt (TR at 49, 50). In his statement to DSS on September 18, 
2001, he stated, "I agree with the balance due and will pay this account in full." (Exhibit E).  Based on the serious time lapse from when he first indicated he 
would pay this creditor, I cannot conclude that this debt will be resolved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 13</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $50. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this debt is due and owing. At the hearing, he testified that he 
had satisfied this debt in 2003 (TR at 50, 51). While he did not introduce evidence showing that the debt had been paid, he did seem </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">certain in his testimony that this was a debt he had paid (TR at 50, 51).  I therefore, conclude that this debt has been satisfied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.p. This debt to Creditor 14</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $783. At the hearing, the Government withdrew this allegation, stating that this debt was not correct (TR at 
51,52). I do not consider this debt to be owed by Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Much of Applicant's early financial difficulties arose during the period that he was in the Navy in 1993, stationed for a tour of duty in Japan. During this period, 
Applicant's wife at the time did not keep current on their bills, and he testified that when he returned to the United States in 1994, he found that he was almost 
$38,000 in debt (TR at 29, 30). Applicant resolved much of that debt  in the bankruptcy discussed above. However, his finances did not resolve themselves after 
that time.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As recently as last year, 2003, Applicant traded in a 1998  truck that he owned, and on which he still owed $10,000,  to purchase a new truck. The dealer added 
the money that he still owed to the financing for the new tuck, resulting in him owing $38,000 for the new truck and having monthly payments of $634. 
Applicant was not able to make the payments, and his truck was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">repossessed. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant could not testify as to how much he is liable for the truck after its sale 
at auction. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has consulted a credit counseling service, and he is attempting to resolve his credit problems. However, at this point, he has a long way to go before 
they are resolved.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines F:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. The evidence has shown that after 
his bankruptcy discharged his debts, he incurred new overdue debts.  Yet, Applicant has taken far too little action to contact the creditors and pay off these 
debts. Based on his tenuous financial situation and his  history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook 
about his finances. I, therefore, resolve Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude DC E2.A6.1.2.1. applies because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial 
obligations. I find that  Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3 applies because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">some of Applicant's past financial difficulties</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> occurred because of his ex-wife's failure to pay the bills during the time he was stationed overseas, which was largely beyond Applicant's<STRONG> </STRONG>control.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, this does not overcome 
Applicant's lack of financial maturity which has manifested itself as recently as 2003, when the new truck he purchased was repossessed because he could not 
make payments on it.  </SPAN></P>
