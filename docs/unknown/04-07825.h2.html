<P>Applicant is 44 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He had a 1981 driving under the influence of alcohol arrest and conviction.  He attended 
two alcohol rehabilitation programs, had intermittent periods of sobriety, but continues to drink alcohol although he admits he is an alcoholic who has been 
professionally diagnosed as an alcohol abuser.  Claiming he has stopped drinking alcohol, he gives three different dates over a two year period for ceasing to 
drink alcohol.  When compared to his entire history, none are believable.  Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption security concern.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 18, 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="04-07825.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 16, 2005.  He requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
<P>On July 27, 2005, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the 
Applicant.  He was given  the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant initially appeared not to 
have filed a response to the FORM within the scheduled due date of September 10, 2005.  The case was assigned to me on September 20, 2005, without any 
response in the file.  I decided the case in a decision dated October 31, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed to the DOHA Appeal Board contending, among other issues, that he had filed a response by the September 10<SUP>th</SUP> deadline.  He submitted 
evidence showing he submitted a response dated September 4, 2005 that was received at DOHA on September 9, 2005.  Thereupon, the Appeal Board 
remanded the case to me for consideration of the response in accordance with the Directive.  The response was included in the case file returned to me.  I read it 
and considered it.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, including Applicant's September 4, 2005, response, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He is an electronics technician.  He is a veteran with 20 years' service in the U.S. 
arine Corps. (Item 4)</P> 
<P>Applicant consumed alcohol from 1981 until at least November 2004. In his May 2003 statement to the government investigator, he had declared his intention 
to stop drinking alcohol then, attend an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting that very day, to admit he continued to drink alcohol, and "to seek and maintain 
sobriety." (Item 5 and Response) </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested in January 1981 for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) after consuming 12 beers at a party.  He was  sentenced on his guilty 
plea to 48 hours of jail time, 40 hours of community service, fined $1,000, and put on probation for up to three years.  Applicant stopped drinking alcohol for 
about 18 months after that incident. (Items 2 and 5)</P> 
<P>When Applicant resumed drinking alcohol, he drank 10 to 12 beers over five hours each Friday and Saturday nights with his friends.  This drinking pattern went 
on from about June 1982  to sometime in 1985 when Applicant started to drink every night.  He would drink four or five beers every night at home while 
continuing the 10 to 12 beer consumption on weekends. (Items 2 and 5)</P> 
<P>In July 1988, Applicant realized he had a drinking problem when he awoke and discovered he had vomited in his sleep.  He told his supervisor.  Within a week 
he was admitted to a  naval hospital for six weeks of in-patient treatment.  He successfully completed the program and was discharged from it.  He went to AA 
meetings daily for the first 90 days, then four or five times weekly.  In 1995 or 1996 Applicant stopped attending AA because he thought he had solved his 
alcohol problem.  In 1997, however, he resumed drinking again with the same pattern of nightly drinking and heavier consumption on the weekend. (Items 2 
and 5)</P> 
<P>On July 28, 2001 Applicant was admitted to a hospital to treat his acute alcohol withdrawal and dehydration.  The physician there diagnosed Applicant as 
suffering from alcohol abuse.  He was discharged on July 30, 2001, with recommendations for AA attendance and participation in a "new visions" program to 
assist Applicant to deal with his alcohol abuse problem.  Applicant attended AA for 90 days, then attended four or five meetings each week until October 2001.  
At that time he moved to another state for employment.  Within 10 days of his move, he started to drink again.  Now he drinks one or two nights per week, 
consuming one or two beers.  He continues to attend AA one or two times per week.  Applicant knows he should not drink.  He knows he has an alcohol 
problem and intended when he made his statement to the government investigator in May 2003 to stop drinking alcohol immediately.  However, Applicant 
admitted in his answer to the SOR he continued to drink until at least March 2004.  He also stated he was an alcoholic and battles alcoholism every day.  His 
latest admission is that he stopped drinking in November 2004, but there is no substantiation of his claim from a credentialed medical professional or licensed 
clinical social worker who is staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. (Items 2, 5, 6)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an 
applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 
00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption: <EM>The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. E2.A7.1.1</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 
applicable are DC 1 (Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence. (E2.A7.1.2.1), DC 3 (Diagnosis by a credentialed medical 
professional (e.g., physician) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. E2.A7.1.2.3), DC 5 (Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment. E2.A7.1.2.5), and DC 6 (Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following 
completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. E2.A7.1.2.6).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a 1981 DUI.  The physician attending him in 2001 when Applicant was admitted to the hospital for alcohol detoxification diagnosed alcohol 
abuse.  Applicant's drinking pattern of every night and larger consumption on weekends is habitual consumption under the guideline.  His continued use of 
alcohol, and his inability to cease drinking even after two alcohol treatment hospitalizations in 1988 and 2001 and periods of sobriety, show Applicant does not 
have full control over his drinking.  Applicant admitted he is an alcoholic in his SOR answer and FORM response, yet he continued to drink alcohol.  He keeps 
changing the latest time when he stopped drinking alcohol, from May 2003 to March 2004, and now the latest date is November 2004.  While well-meaning, 
Applicant does not have sufficient control over his drinking problem to instill confidence in his professions of future sobriety. Furthermore, he does not support 
his latest statement contained in his September 2005 response with any professional evaluation to counterbalance his 20 year alcohol history.  His unsupported 
present declarations of future sobriety, the fact he never compromised classified information while he was in the military, and "his impeccable service 
record"are not sufficient to overcome security concerns raised by his inability to control his alcohol consumption. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable here.  There are no positive changes to support sobriety, no lengthy current sobriety.  Applicant's 
statements after May 2003 when he signed his statement for the investigator show he has been unable to control his drinking.  Therefore, I conclude this alcohol 
consumption security guideline against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
