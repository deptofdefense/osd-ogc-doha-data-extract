<P>Applicant was arrested several times between 1983 and 2003. He admits the underlying criminal conduct for those arrests. Applicant does not accept that he has 
an alcohol problem. Although he no longer consumes alcohol, he failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns raised by his lengthy criminal history. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 14 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-25509.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 1 February 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 23 May 2005. 
On 22 June 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 30 June 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old engineering technician for a defense contractor. His supervisors find him to have a strong work ethic. They report that he completes 
all tasks in a timely manner and has not displayed any conduct that would lead them to consider him to be a threat to national security. Ex. C, D.</P> 
<P>Applicant was married to M from 1979-83. They had two children. In February 1983, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery of his wife. He had been 
separated from her. When he returned to the house to retrieve his checkbook there was an altercation. He grabbed her by the neck and pushed her back against 
the door. Tr. 21. He was placed in a diversion program. Ex. 7. That same month, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was 
convicted of the offense, and ordered to complete community service and pay a fine. After his divorce, he eventually was awarded custody of both children.</P> 
<P>In March 1984, Applicant was arrested and charged with petty theft. He shoplifted a tool from a department store. In December 1984, he was convicted of the 
1983 battery charge for which he had been placed in a diversion program. He was given a suspended sentence with probation for three years and a fine. Ex. 7.</P> 
<P>In September 1984, he married S. They had two children. In January 1997 he separated from S, who convinced court to issue a permanent restraining order 
against him. She claimed he pointed a gun at her. Applicant denies he did so. They were divorced in February 1998. Applicant eventually won custody of both 
children of this marriage. </P> 
<P>After he separated from his wife, Applicant saw a mental health counselor because he was distressed about losing his kids. The counselor recommended he go 
to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Applicant attended AA almost nightly for a year, but never got a sponsor. Tr. 28; Ex. 5 at 6. He did not consume alcohol 
between 1997 and 1999.</P> 
<P>In 1999, Applicant married again and resumed consuming alcoholic beverages. He admits he "typically drank with friends and at social get-togethers, such as 
barbecues, about once every five months. At most, I might drink a six pack of beer and two shots of tequila during the course of the day." Ex. 5 at 5. On 30 June 
2003 he and his wife were out drinking. They were both drunk. When they returned home, his wife began chasing his son around the yard. Applicant interceded 
and took her to the master bedroom where he struck her with his open hand. When police arrived, Applicant admitted striking his wife about five times. Police 
observed a bright red mark on her face. Applicant was charged with third degree assault-knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury to another person. He 
pled guilty to the charge. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, and probation for 24 months. Applicant reported regularly to his probation officer 
and completed the 36-week domestic violence counseling treatment program. He complied with all terms of his probation and demonstrated appropriate 
behavior and a positive attitude towards his probation and sentence. Ex. E. His probation was successfully completed on 15 June 2005. Ex. H. </P> 
<P>Applicant hasn't had an alcoholic drink since that incident in 2003-it was a term of his probation-and his wife stopped drinking in 2004. In October 2003, he 
hadn't decided whether he would abstain from using alcohol after his probation was completed. Ex. 5 at 5. At the hearing, Applicant insisted he intends to 
abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages in the future.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was charged and convicted of a February 1983 battery (&para; 1.a), convicted of a February 1983 DUI (&para; 1.b), arrested in 
arch 1984 for petty theft (&para; 1.c), was issued a permanent restraining order in January 1997 (&para; 1.d), and was convicted of a third degree assault by knowingly 
or recklessly causing bodily injury to another in June 2003 (&para; 1.d). Applicant admitted each of the allegations with explanation. A history or pattern of criminal 
activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline J. Applicant has admitted criminal 
conduct (DC E.A10.1.2.2) consisting of multiple lesser offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegation in &para; 1.d of the SOR is unartfully drawn. Being issued a permanent restraining order is not criminal conduct. Nevertheless, I conclude the 
allegation was sufficient to put Applicant on notice of the underlying criminal conduct that was the basis for the order-he pointed a gun at his wife. Although 
Applicant denies he pointed a gun at his wife, I find his denial unpersuasive. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation as he has stopped consuming alcohol and he completed the domestic violence counseling 
and treatment program. <EM>See</EM> MC E2.A10.1.3.6. But the first step toward rehabilitation is acknowledgeing there is a problem. Applicant refuses to do so. 
Applicant does have a alcohol problem as demonstrated by the two alcohol-related criminal offenses of which he was convicted and the advice of the mental 
health counselor that he attend AA.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant insists he is better able to communicate after completing the court-ordered domestic violence counseling and treatment program. His wife confirms 
his improvement in interpersonal skills. But that improvement came while he was on probation and his probation ended only a month before the hearing. Under 
the circumstances, I am unable to conclude he has mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Applicant needs to show he can maintain his sobriety 
and his good conduct for a period when he is not on probation and under the supervision of a court. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the other mitigating conditions apply. I find against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
