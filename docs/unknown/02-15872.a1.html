  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  The Administrative Judge's findings of fact reflect a reasonable, legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence, and her conclusions follow rationally from her factual findings.  The fact that Applicant argues that different conclusions should be drawn from the record  evidence does not demonstrate the Judge erred.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 7, 2003, which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated April 27, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The issue raised on appeal is whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the 
Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="02-15872.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In his brief, Applicant appeals the Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions.  He makes statements regarding his financial situation, most of which he made at earlier 
stages in the clearance process.<A HREF="02-15872.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board interprets his appeal brief as raising the issue of whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant objects to the conclusions drawn by the Administrative Judge.  The Judge had the entire record before her, including Applicant's explanations.  There is a 
presumption that the Judge considered the entire record, and Applicant has not demonstrated that she did not do so.  The Judge was not legally required to accept 
Applicant's explanations.  Rather, the Judge could consider Applicant's explanations in light of the record as a whole and decide whether those explanations were 
credible.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at p. 3.  The fact that Applicant argues that different conclusions should be drawn from the record 
evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  The Judge's findings reflect a reasonable, legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence, and her 
conclusions follow rationally from her factual findings.</P> 
 
<P>Likewise, Applicant's statement that he has served his country for many years does not indicate any error in the Judge's decision.  The federal government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  The Judge's 
uncontested findings of fact provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse security decision.  Applicant has not shown that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
