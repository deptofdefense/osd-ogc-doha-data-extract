</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 1 August 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of criminal conduct 
and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 6 August 2005 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 February 2006 and I convened a hearing 30 March 2006. DOHA 
received the transcript 10 April 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for allegations he falsified information during a subject interview in January 2004 (SOR 1.d. and 1.e).<A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions 
as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">a 36-year-old security guard, see</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">king to retain the clearance he has held since approximately January 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In June 2000, Applicant was fired from his job as a security officer for an unexcused absence from work. Applicant explained that he was working two security guard positions at the time, was held 
overtime at his first job, and thus unable to go to his second job. However, part of the reason he was fired from the second job was that he did not inform his employer that he was not going to appear for 
work as scheduled. In June 2002, he was counseled at his other job for failing to answer his radio and report for inspection. In October 2002, this employer again counseled him for refusing an order and 
failing to follow post duties.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In March 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of crack cocaine. He eventually pleaded guilty on advice of counsel, was fined, and given probation before judgment. Ultimately, he 
had his criminal record expunged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The precipitating event for the March 2002 arrest was Applicant's single vehicle accident, in which he skidded off the roadway and crossed two grass median strips before crashing into a parked car and 
security gate at the entrance to an automobile dealership. The investigating officer observed Applicant standing next to his vehicle appearing lost and confused. However, Applicant declined offers of 
medical attention. Applicant's vehicle was not operable, and the investigating officer summoned a tow truck. He then began a pre-impoundment inventory of the vehicle's contents, during which he 
observed a soda can with several holes punched on the sides, and signs of fresh soot near the holes. Near the can the officer discovered a plastic baggie with a crystal substance he believed to be crack 
cocaine. Applicant was taken into custody and searched. Two similar baggies were discovered in the upper right pocket of Applicant's leather jacket. The crystal substances subsequently field tested 
positive for cocaine (G.E. 2). Applicant has never explained how he came to be involved in the accident in the first place. It does not appear that he was arrested for being under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant vehemently insi</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">sts that the cocaine found in his car was not his, and offers that it must have come from four teenagers who stopped at the scene of the accident before the police arrived. He 
offers no explanation why four teenagers who were not involved in the accident in any way, or required in any way to remain on the scene of the accident, would want to abandon their cocaine simply to 
implicate Applicant. Nor does he explain how cocaine was found in the breast pocket of his leather jacket, except to make the non-sequitur claim that he was not wearing the jacket at the time--a claim 
factually inconsistent with the investigating officer's report of his search. Further, the officer's statement of probable cause makes no mention of any other vehicles or persons at the scene of the 
accident.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government established a case for disqualification under Guidelines J and E,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. Applicant's arrest for cocaine possession casts considerable doubt on his 
judgment and reliability.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the crime was an isolated incident and not recent,<A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> any claim he has to rehabilitation<A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> is severely undercut by his insistence that the cocaine was not his and 
offering an explanation that is both implausible and improbable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Against this background, Applicant's disciplinary incidents with his two employers take additional security significance. He was fired from one security guard position for failing to report to work 
without notice. He was disciplined by his current employer for failing to comply with instructions and orders.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-00702.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> Although this conduct was not particularly recent, Applicant has produced no 
evidence--other than the absence of recurrence--to overcome the adverse security significance of his conduct. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline J and E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
