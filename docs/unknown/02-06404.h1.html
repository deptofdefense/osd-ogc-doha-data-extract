<P>Applicant encountered numerous arrests and convictions (many involving alcohol-related incidents) over a twenty-year period spanning 1983 and January 2003.  
 With only recent acknowledgments of an alcohol problem to his credit and little counseling or AA involvement to address the problem, Applicant neither 
extenuates nor mitigates security concerns associated with his history of criminal and alcohol-related arrests and convictions.  His omission of his two felony 
arrests and various alcohol-related arrests are resolved favorable to Applicant based on his convincing showing (a) his felony arrests were the result of a 
reasonable misreading of the question and (b) his alcohol-related arrests, while knowingly and wilfully omitted from his SF-86, were promptly corrected in 
good faith when afforded an opportunity in an ensuing DSS interview.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 20, 2003 and requested a hearing.  I was  assigned  this case on May 21, 2003, and initially scheduled it for hearing 
on June 26, 2003.  The matter was rescheduled for hearing on July 21, 2003.  A hearing was convened on July 21, 2003, as scheduled, for the purpose of 
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the 
Government's case consisted of twelve exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was 
received on July 29, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been cited or arrested on twelve different  occasions between March 1983 and March 12, 2000: for public 
drunkenness in March 2000 (fined $45.00), for operating a vehicle with a revoked driver's license in November 1995 (found guilty, ordered to pay court costs 
and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with all but 10 days suspended), for operating a vehicle after being declared a habitual offender in October 1995 (dismissed), 
for public intoxication in December 1994 (fined $15.00), for driving on a suspended-revoked  driver's license in September 1993 (found guilty and fined 
$25.00), for DuI and refusal to take a blood test in May 1993 (found guilty, fined $750.00, sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and loss of driver's license), 
for DUI and refusal to take a blood test in September 1992 (found guilty of DuI, fined $500.00, sentenced to 30 days in jail, 28 days suspended, and suspension 
of driver's license), for DUI in July 1991 (pleaded no contest, fined and spent 24 hours in jail), for DuI in February 1989, for DUI in February 1988, for hit and 
run personal injury (a felony) in July 1985, and for profane swearing  in March 1983.</P> 
 
<P>Also, Applicant's offenses covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.j are alleged to be alcohol-related as well, and covered by Guideline G.</P> 
 
<P>Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of March 27, 2001 by omitting (a) his felony arrest of 1985 and (b) 
his alcohol-related offenses of July 1991, February 1989 and February 1988.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the listed allegations.  He denied  only that he intentionally falsified his SF-86.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  
Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Throughout the 80s and 90s, Applicant abused alcohol and was involved in numerous criminal incidents: some alcohol-related.  All of his arrests and 
convictions involved misdemeanors,  save for two: a felony hit and run arrest (in 1985), in which he late pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense, and a felony 
operating a motor vehicle after being declared an habitual offender arrest, which was subsequently dismissed (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at  59).  </P> 
 
<P>Besides his last covered alcohol-related incident in March 2000, Applicant admits to being arrested for DUI in June 2002.  To this offense, he pleaded guilty 
and was fined $500.00 and ordered to attend rehabilitation counseling.  Prior to being arrested, he had been on business travel for his company and was 
returning from dinner with friends.  At dinner, he consumed between six and seven drinks.  He had still another DUI arrest in January 2003 before commencing 
his ordered  professional counseling (in February 2003).   Before seeking treating in February 2003, he was accustomed to drinking regularly when on travel 
(often two to three times a week), often to the point of intoxication (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 56).  After diagnosing him with an alcohol problem, Applicant's treatment 
provider not only prescribed him antabuse for a couple of months, but he recommended AA participation for him as well (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 37).  Applicant, however, 
declined ongoing AA participation (believing he didn't need it) after attending just a few meetings (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 37-38, 49-51).  Disposition of his 2003 arrest is 
still pending.  Applicant has since completed his ordered counseling in connection with his 2002 DUI incident.  Depending on the disposition of his latest 2003 
DuI arrest, though, he could be required to seek additional treatment.  Although he has not seen his treatment provider now for several months, he is willing to 
get into a permanent program that will help him to keep his clearance and job.   The SOR he received was a major wake-up call for him and prompted him to 
quit drinking. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant now believes he has an alcohol problem: a remarkable turnabout from  his earlier assurances to an interviewing DSS agent in April 2001 that he had 
no such problem (<EM>compare </EM>ex. 2 with R.T., at 43-44).   Believing at the time he did not have an alcohol problem, he continued to drink.  His 2002 DUI 
convinced him he had an alcohol problem, which required treatment.   However, he has resisted Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) participation, considering it too 
informal for him.  He attended only a few AA meetings before discontinuing participation altogether.  He never obtained a sponsor and has no earned chips 
from his brief AA experience.  Since joining an informal discussion group, he has no considered returning to AA.</P> 
 
<P>When executing his SF-86 of March 27, 2001, Applicant omitted  his 1985 hit and run and 1996 habitual offender arrests (both felony arrests), as well as his 
alcohol-related arrests in 1988, 1989 and 1991, respectively.  He attributes his felony arrest omissions when answering question 21 to his unawareness that his 
1985 and 1996 incidents were felony-related (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 42, 48, 59).   His explanation is reasonable and accepted, given both the age of the incidents and 
ensuing misdemeanor plea and dismissal of the respective charges.</P> 
 
<P>As to his alcohol-related arrests, he claims he simply misread the question (question 24 of his SF-86).  This explanation is more difficult to accept as an 
oversight, given the plain language of the question.  However, Applicant promptly provided the details of his omitted alcohol-related arrests when interviewed 
by a DSS agent several days later (in April 2001), without being first confronted (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 57).  Applicant's credibility is pretty good overall, and he is 
credited with promptly correcting his alcohol-related omissions without agent confrontation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by supervisor and work colleagues as a hardworking, dependable and valued employee (<EM>see</EM> exs. B and C).  His ethics  and conduct 
have been considered beyond reproach by members of his company who have worked with him.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history

or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of materiality, however, does 
not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance.  Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of misdemeanor criminal arrests (twelve in all) over a twenty-year period spanning 1983 and 2003, most of which resulted in 
convictions. His arrest record includes a felony hit and run arrest as well, with no disposition of record.  Six of the covered arrests (including his most recent 
three offenses) involved alcohol-related incidents. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's confrontations with law enforcement authorities resulted not only in  fines, supervised probation 
and counseling, but imposed suspension of driving privileges as well. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each of Applicant's arrest/convictions reflect criminal conduct and implicit judgment lapses and raise security concerns covered by the criminal conduct 
guidelines of the Directive's Adjudicative Guidelines.  Both Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (alleged or admitted criminal conduct) and DC 2 (single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses) of the criminal conduct guidelines apply to these arrest/convictions.  Because many of these arrests and convictions also 
involve alcohol, they become security significant as alcohol-related incidents covered by the alcohol guidelines of the Adjudicative Guidelines as well.  
Applicable disqualifying conditions comprise DC 1 (alcohol incidents away from work).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pattern criminally based alcohol-related incidents not only produce compounding security concerns under the Adjudicative Guidelines, but they are antithetical 
to any practical use of any of the mitigating conditions for alcohol abuse under the same Guidelines for either criminal conduct or alcohol abuse.  With so little 
time to show any positive changes in his behavior since his last admitted DuI arrest in January 2003</SPAN>, Applicant is poorly situated to take advantage of any of the 
mitigating conditions covered by either the criminal conduct or alcohol guidelines of the Adjudicative Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Without any evidence of Applicant's acknowledgment of any lingering alcohol problems following his last alcohol-related arrest in 2003,  it is simply too 
difficult to quantify or qualify any tangible mitigation.  By his own account, he has not sought counseling or AA participation and only recently acknowledged 
an alcohol problem associated with his numerous alcohol-related arrests and convictions.  Medical assessments would be helpful in identifying and correcting 
any residual alcohol problems of Applicant, but are clearly lacking in this record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Able to persuasively demonstrate less than seven months of elapsed time without any additional alcohol-related incidents, Applicant may not reasonably claim 
any of the mitigation conditions of the Administrative Guidelines (for alcohol) or absolve himself of security risks associated with his long history of proven 
alcohol abuse.  Considering the record as a whole, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant's alcohol problems are behind him.  Unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to each of the allegations covered by Guidelines J and G.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concern as well are Applicant's omissions of his lone felony offense (a 1985 hit and run arrest) and his four alcohol-related offenses 
(<EM>viz., </EM>his March 2000, December 1994, May 1993 and February 1988 arrests/convictions).  Having accepted Applicant's explanation of his misreading question 
21, this alleged omission is unsubstantiated (<EM>see</EM> MC 1 of personal conduct guidelines).  Developed falsification jurisprudence within DOHA's Appeal Board 
and the courts nationally have never been tied to reasonable man tenets (save for use in appraising all of the surrounding circumstances) and at the core still 
require established motive and specific intent to falsify a document.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR OSD Case No. 01-06870 (September 13, 2002). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations for omitting his alcohol-related incidents when answering question 2 are more problematical and leave unresolved doubts about his 
veracity when addressing question 24 of his SF-86.  Government may invoke DC 1 (falsification of a security questionnaire) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
personal conduct.  However, Applicant was forthcoming about his omitted alcohol-related arrests when asked about them by an interviewing DSS agent several 
days later.  Before being confronted with any of the arrests, he disclosed his additional alcohol-related ones to the interviewing DSS agent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the strength of the evidence presented, Applicant may invoke MC 1 (information unsubstantiated) as to his omitted felony arrests and MC 3 (prompt, good-faith correction as to his alcohol-related arrests) of the Adjudicative guidelines for personal conduct and carries his evidentiary burden in refuting the allegations 
he falsified his SF-86 by omitting his alcohol-related arrests.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to both sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
