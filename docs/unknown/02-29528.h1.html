<P>Applicant's conduct since moving to the United States in 1995 has indicated a clear preference for the United States over Ethiopia. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as administratively reissued on April 20, 1999), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed 
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 9, 2004, and elected to have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case (FORM) on or about May 17, 2004. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or about June 5, 2004. The 
case was assigned to me on July 9, 2004.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 45 year old employee of a defense contractor.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in the Ethiopia. He has lived in the United States continuously since at least 1995. In 2001, he became a United States citizen.</P> 
<P>Applicant's mother, father, and three of his siblings are citizens and residents of the Ethiopia. Applicant has contact with them "generally during the holidays 
and approximately once every three months by telephone." None of these family members "worked or do work for a foreign government, nor have they held 
any political office"(Exhibit 5).  Two of applicant's siblings reside in the United States. One became a United States citizen in 2002; the other remains a citizen 
of Ethiopia.</P> 
<P>Applicant has no financial ties with, and owns no property in, Ethiopia.</P> 
<P>Applicant traveled to Ethiopia for about three weeks in early 2001. This was his first trip in 13 years to visit his family. He did not disclose this trip on a 
Security Clearance Application (SCA) he executed in April 2002. The Government concedes this was not an intentional misrepresentation.<A HREF="02-29528.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that applicant's mother, father, and three of his siblings are citizens and residents of Ethiopia and that one 
of his siblings, although a resident of the United States, is a citizen of Ethiopia. These facts require application of Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1 <EM>(an 
immediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country)</EM>.</P> 
<P>There is no evidence that any of applicant's Ethiopian family members are agents of Ethiopia. In addition, there is no evidence that any of these family 
members are in a position to be exploited by the Ethiopia in a way that could force applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and loyalty to 
the United States. Based on these facts, Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1 <EM>(a determination that the immediate family member(s) in question are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States)</EM>, is applicable, and Guideline B is found for applicant.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline C, the only factual allegation is that applicant failed to disclose on an SCA that he traveled to Ethiopia in 2001. It is difficult to 
understand how this alleged falsification indicates applicant has a preference for Ethiopia over the United States.<A HREF="02-29528.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> In any event, the evidence establishes that 
since at least 1995, applicant's conduct has indicated a clear preference for the United States over the Ethiopia. Given this fact, Guideline C is found for 
applicant.</P>
