  An applicant is entitled to reasonable notice of the allegations being made against him so that he can have a meaningful opportunity to respond to those allegations.  Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered for some purposes.  The Administrative Judge did not err by considering record evidence  of Applicant's marijuana use to assess his credibility and his history of alcohol abuse.  Judge's formal finding with respect to one SOR subparagraph was  inconsistent with his factual findings, but the error was harmless under the particular facts and circumstances of this case.  Judge's application of the  Adjudicative Guidelines concerning Alcohol Consumption was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 21, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based on Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal 
Conduct).  Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated October 31, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by considering Applicant's history of drug use even though drug 
involvement was not cited in the  Statement of Reasons; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by issuing a finding against Applicant under paragraph 1.j 
of the SOR; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline G's disqualifying and mitigating conditions in Applicant's case was arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by considering Applicant's history of drug use even though drug involvement was not alleged in the Statement of 
Reasons</SPAN>.  Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's consideration of Applicant's history of marijuana use in the Judge's decision.  Applicant argues on 
appeal that the SOR did not cite Guideline H (Drug Involvement) as a basis for denying Applicant a clearance, and therefore the Judge's consideration of the 
Applicant's prior marijuana use was in violation of the notice requirements of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Although Applicant raises an 
important issue, after a thorough review of the Judge's decision, the Board does not agree.</P> 
 
<P>An applicant is entitled to receive reasonable notice of the allegations being made against him so that the applicant can have a meaningful opportunity to 
respond to the allegations.<EM> See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0710 (March 19, 2001) at p. 2.  However, an SOR need not allege every piece of evidence that is 
relevant and material to evaluating an applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-07360 (April 10, 2002) at p. 5.  Furthermore, as long as there 
is fair notice to an applicant about the matters that are at issue in his case, and the applicant has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a security clearance case 
should be adjudicated on the merits of the relevant issues and should not be overly concerned with pleading niceties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0710 (March 
19, 2001) at p. 2.  Finally, the Board has previously held that conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to 
evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful 
rehabilitation; or (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0582 (November 12, 
1999) at p. 9.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the evidence of Applicant's marijuana use was contained in Government's Exhibit 3--a signed, sworn statement make by the Applicant.  A copy of 
that document was provided to the Applicant prior to the hearing<A HREF="02-07218.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and the document was admitted into evidence without objection.<A HREF="02-07218.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In his Decision, the 
Judge noted that although the Applicant's marijuana use had not been alleged in the SOR as an independent basis for the denial of Applicant's clearance, it was 
evidence which tended to undermine a significant inference which the Applicant urged the Judge to draw from the evidence Applicant was offering in 
extenuation, mitigation, and changed circumstances, regarding the Guideline G allegations.  The Judge also noted that that evidence reflected adversely on the 
sincerity--and thus credibility--of Applicant's arguments with respect to the Guideline G allegations.  Such use of the evidence in question was permissible.  
<EM>See Id.</EM>  Because the Judge found for Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) the Board concludes that ultimately the Judge did not make use of the 
Applicant's marijuana history as an independent basis for denial of his clearance.  The Judge did consider the marijuana use for whatever light it cast upon 
Applicant's alcohol consumption which was an issue which was properly before him.  It was not unreasonable for the Judge to conclude that a person's use of 
non-therapeutic drugs is of some relevance to an analysis of that person's use of alcohol.  Applicant has not demonstrated error on this point.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by issuing a finding against Applicant under paragraph 1.j of the SOR</SPAN>.  Paragraph 1.j of the SOR reads: "From 
approximately December 2001 to January 2003, you drank wine approximately 3-5 times a month to the point of intoxication."  In his decision, the Judge 
stated: "It is uncontroverted that Applicant has not been intoxicated since his last arrest" [1998] and "Applicant's responses to adjudicator-issued interrogatories 
clearly show he still drinks although not to intoxication as alleged in subparagraph 1.j."  Given those findings, the Judge erred by finding against Applicant with 
respect to paragraph 1.j -- absent an amendment of that paragraph to conform with the evidence.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.17.  
However, because the Judge's findings and conclusions with respect to the other Guideline G allegations are sustainable, this error does not change the ultimate 
outcome of the case.  It is therefore, harmless.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline G's disqualifying and mitigating conditions in Applicant's case was arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline G's disqualifying conditions in several respects: (1) Applicant argues 
that the Directive is concerned about consumption of alcohol to excess and he believes the government did not demonstrate that he drinks to excess; (2) 
Applicant argues the government failed to demonstrate a nexus between Applicant's history of alcohol consumption and the security clearance concerns; (3) 
Applicant argues he has not been intoxicated since 1998; (4) Applicant argues that the testimony of six character witnesses demonstrates that he has no problem 
with alcohol; (5) Applicant argues that if he had an alcohol problem and is now 'dry' he would be protected by the Rehabilitation Act; and (6) Applicant points 
to DOHA cases in which persons with alcohol issues received clearances.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's first argument is unpersuasive.  The Concern section of the Guideline does use the language "Excessive alcohol consumption."  The Directive then 
outlines specific conditions which may be disqualifying, the first of which is "Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use."  Applicant's history includes five alcohol-related arrests over a 
thirty-year period which was the basis for the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's second argument is without merit.  The Board has previously held that satisfying the disqualifying conditions of the Directive is sufficient to 
demonstrate a nexus between an Applicant's conduct (or circumstances) and the government's security clearance concerns.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(February 8, 2001), at p. 12.  As discussed in the previous paragraph, Applicant's history of alcohol-related incidents fits the terms of Disqualifying Condition 1 
under Guideline G.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's remaining arguments are best addressed in the context of his arguments challenging the Administrative Judge's application of the mitigating 
conditions.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant claims the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline G mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law because: (1) 
Applicant argues his conduct did not constitute a pattern; (2) Applicant believes that he has not had a recent problem; (3) Applicant believes he has positive 
changes in his behavior; (4) Applicant cites testimony of character witnesses; and (5) Applicant cites DOHA cases in which other applicants were granted 
security clearances.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's first argument is unpersuasive.  Five alcohol-related arrests over twenty-five years are certainly enough to establish a pattern.  The fact that they are 
spread out irregularly over a period of decades may make the pattern hard to describe succinctly, but they are of more than adequate quantity and weight to meet 
the government's security concerns.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's second and third arguments are also unpersuasive.  Applicant's multiple arrests were not grouped neatly together; the gap between his third and 
fourth alcohol-related arrests was about twelve years.  The fact that Applicant has not been arrested since 1998 is not sufficient, given his history and 
circumstances, to demonstrate that his problem is solved.  Similarly, Applicant's recent period of abstinence (from January 2003 to the close of the record in 
June 2003) is not enough legally or logically to mandate that the Administrative Judge offset Applicant's lengthy history of alcohol-related arrests through 
application of the mitigating conditions.  This paragraph is also responsive to Applicant's third and fifth arguments regarding the Judge's application of the 
disqualifying conditions.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's fourth argument here (as well as his fourth argument regarding the disqualifying conditions) is without merit.  The Board will not disturb the 
Administrative Judge's weighing of the evidence absent a showing that that weighing was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Nothing here suggests that 
the Judge was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law in assigning weight to the character testimony.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's fifth argument here (and his sixth argument under the disqualifying conditions) relies on DOHA hearing office decisions. The Board has previously 
noted that a decision by a Hearing Office Administrative Judge is not legally binding precedent on other Hearing Office Judges or the Board. Just as the 
decision of one trial-level judge is not legally binding precedent on a fellow trial-level judge, the decision of one Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding 
precedent on another Hearing Office Judge.  Similarly, just as the decision of a trial-level tribunal is not legally binding precedent on an appellate tribunal, the 
decisions of Hearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on the Board.  Accordingly, Applicant's ability to cite Hearing Office decisions in other 
cases that appear to support his position does not demonstrate the Judge's decision in this case is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Furthermore, the 
Board has no obligation to follow the Hearing Office decisions cited by Applicant, and no obligation to reconcile the Judge's decision below with the Hearing 
Office decisions cited by Applicant.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 02-15358 (July 22, 2003) at p. 3.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Dissenting opinion of Chairman Emilio Jaksetic</STRONG>:</CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>I dissent from the majority's decision to affirm the decision below.  The first appeal issue demonstrates error that warrants remand to the Administrative Judge 
with instructions to reopen the record and receive additional evidence from the parties (subject to appropriate objections, cross-examination of witnesses, and 
possible presentation of rebuttal evidence) on the matter of Applicant's history of marijuana use.</P> 
 
<P>An SOR need not enumerate every thing that is relevant to a case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.  00-0030 (September 20, 2001) at p. 6.  Furthermore, an 
Administrative Judge may consider conduct not alleged in an SOR  for some purposes.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-07360 (April 10, 2002) at p. 5 (conduct not 
alleged in SOR can be considered: to assess an applicant's credibility; to evaluate an applicant's claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; or 
to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation).  However, if there is a significant variance between the SOR allegations and 
Judge's findings and conclusions, then a serious question may arise as to whether an applicant received adequate notice and a fair opportunity to adjudicate his 
or her security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0710 (March 19, 2001) at pp. 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge must be fair and impartial.  Directive, Section 4.1; Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.10.  However, a Judge's 
obligation to be fair and impartial does not require the Judge to simply ignore record evidence that is relevant to evaluating an applicant's security eligibility.  
Even if neither party moves to amend an SOR to conform to the record evidence, a Judge has the authority to do so.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.17.  But, even if a Judge amends an SOR to conform to the record evidence, a Judge cannot do so without providing the parties with: (a) 
notice of the Judge's intention to do so; (b) an opportunity to be heard on the proposed amendment to the SOR; and (c) an opportunity to present evidence 
pertinent to the SOR amendment.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-0729 (May 31, 1995) at pp. 4-6.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for concluding that the record evidence of Applicant's marijuana use had relevance to evaluating 
Applicant's history of alcohol use and Applicant's claim of reform and rehabilitation.  However, given the manner in which the Judge took that evidence into 
account in his decision, and given the appearance that the Judge is basing his adverse decision, in part, on conduct outside Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption)<A HREF="02-07218.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, Applicant's claim of surprise is not frivolous and raises a serious question as to the fairness of his security clearance adjudication.</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant's claim of unfair surprise is persuasive, the remedy he seeks (<EM>i.e.</EM>, reversal) is not warranted.  Given the procedural nature of the error 
identified by Applicant, the appropriate remedy would be a remand to the Administrative Judge with instructions to reopen the record and allow the parties to 
present evidence on (subject to appropriate objections, cross-examination of witnesses, and possible presentation of rebuttal evidence) on the matter of 
Applicant's history of marijuana use.</P> 
 
<P>I express no opinion as to the rest of the appeal issues.  Because I conclude that remand of the case would be the appropriate disposition of this appeal, it would 
be premature for me to address the remaining appeal issues since the evidence that would be introduced on remand could result in the Administrative Judge 
modifying his findings and conclusions.</P>
