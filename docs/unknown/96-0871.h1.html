<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  as amended by
Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated December 10, 1996, to the Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	On January 23, 1997,  Applicant, at that time acting<EM> pro se</EM>,  responded to the allegations set
forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 18, 1997, and on
arch 24, 1997 a hearing was scheduled for April 10, 1997.  At the hearing held as scheduled, six
Government exhibits and five Applicant exhibits were admitted into evidence.  Testimony was taken
from the Applicant and one witness for the Applicant.  A transcript of the hearing was received by
this office on April 18, 1997.             </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	After a thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the 
same, I make the following findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is 49 years old and has been a wind tunnel operator at the same location since
November 1971.<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Applicant has a good reputation at work, is a top worker in his field and very
reliable, and has outstanding job performance.  </P>

<P>	From 1969 until 1993 Applicant drank little alcohol.<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife began to have
marital problems in 1993.  In March 1994 Applicant and his wife separated.  She moved out of the
house for 6 months.  They reconciled and she moved back into the home for six month.  In February
1995, Applicant's wife told Applicant she wanted a divorce.  A month later, in March 1995, the
divorce became final ending a 27-year marriage.  </P>

<P>	Applicant started drinking alcohol in 1993.  His drinking started with a few mixed drinks
with dinner.  On August 6, 1995, he was arrested after drinking with an old high school buddy that
he had not seen in 30 years.  His blood alcohol content was .19%.<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Applicant pled guilty to Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) and served 48 hours in jail, served one year probation, and had his
driver's license restricted.  Following his arrest until two weeks before Christmas 1995 Applicant
did not drink any alcohol.</P>

<P>	Following the arrest Applicant said he drank 3 or 4 beers about twice weekly at home. On
February 28, 1996, when the sworn statement (Gov Ex 3) was made, Applicant intended to maintain
drinking beer at a moderate or less rate.  He said that the arrest was an isolated incident and that
alcohol would never cause him any more problems. Applicant's prediction turned out to be wrong. </P>

<P>	Because his license was restricted because of the 1995 DUI conviction, Applicant was unable
to drive anywhere other than work. He sat at home and drank. (Gov Ex 4) In June 1996 he was
drinking more and by August 1996 his drinking had progressed to the point where he was drinking
two six-packs of beer a night. On September 4, 1996, Applicant got very intoxicated and called his
ex-wife.  Applicant indicated he was going to kill himself.  The following day, September 5, 1996,
Applicant enrolled in a treatment program.  He was diagnosed as "alcohol dependence" [Gov Ex 5]. 
His treatment lasted 20 days, from September 5 through September 24, 1996. </P>

<P>	Following this treatment he thought he was cured and did not accept that he was an alcoholic. 
By October 15, 1996, when he completed another signed, sworn statement [Gov Ex 4], Applicant
was attending outpatient treatment 4 nights per week.  In October 1996 he attended AA almost daily. 
Since his release he had missed two meetings, due to work. He also drank beer on two occasions
following his release from treatment.  Each time he had 3 beers.  In his statement Applicant again
stated that it was his hope that alcohol would not cause him any problems in the future.  This was
not to be.</P>

<P>	He remained sober for 29 days. He then returned to drinking.  At Thanksgiving 1996 he had
4 days off from work.  It was the first Thanksgiving that his family was not together.  He got
depressed and got "super drunk." [Tr 45]  He then went 11 days without drinking.  Facing two weeks
of Christmas vacation from work, Applicant began to drink again.  On Thursday, December 12, 1996
he stopped and bought liquor on his way home from work.  He called into work on Friday morning
and took a vacation day.  Friday he sat, drank, watched movies, and looked out the window. [Tr 46]. 
He drank through Friday and Saturday.  December 14, 1996, Saturday afternoon he got in his car to
take the movies back to the movie rental store.</P>

<P>	Applicant was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident. Applicant's vehicle almost rear
ended another automobile.  His vehicle went into the ditch and turned over. [Tr 38] Applicant's
injuries required 10 stitches to his head. Applicant spent the night in jail.  Prior to the accident
Applicant consumed alcohol.<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Applicant was convicted of reckless driving and violation of the open
container law.<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	On Sunday morning December 15, 1996, following his release from jail, Applicant drank two
6-packs of beer he had in his refrigerator.  After drinking the two 6-packs he called the treatment
center.  He returned to the treatment center and was readmitted for 5 days of inpatient treatment.
Applicant's diagnosis was "alcohol dependence" and major depression.  The discharge summary
(Gov Ex 6) states Applicant was very motivated for treatment.  Applicant reported, during treatment,
that he started drinking to cope with his divorce and that if it were not for the feelings of depression
he would not drink. (Gov Ex 6). He reportedly uses alcohol as a crutch.  He could not handle the
depression and entering an empty house after work each day. </P>

<P>	On December 20, 1996, he was discharged from the inpatient program and admitted to an
intensive outpatient program. [App Ex B] Since December 20, 1996 he has attended AA meetings
5 to 8 times a week.  Following the December 1996 accident Applicant attitude toward AA changed. 
He stated, in the Psychosocial Assessment (Gov Ex 6, page 6) that he describes himself as an
agnostic.  Applicant was having difficulty accepting the ideology of step one of the AA program. 
This last drink was on December 15, 1996.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in
making the overall common sense determination  required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's
conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or
presence of rehabilitation, the potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct
will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2.  Because
each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the
factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. 
oreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable
behavior. </P>

<P>	 Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</P>

<P><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>	(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,
fighting. . .</P>

<P>	3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse</P>

<P>	(4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>	(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>

<P>	In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and
logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must
make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as
a security concern under the Directive, then the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial
evidence  in explanation, mitigation, or extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that
despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgement,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of
confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times
and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs,
then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude toward security
rules and regulations.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of the Applicant,  this Judge concludes that
the Government has established its case with regard to criterion G. On reviewing the corresponding
mitigating factors (MF), there is a sufficient pattern to his alcohol-related incidents and his problem
is too recent to favorably apply MC 1 or 2, respectively.  </P>

<P>	Applicant drank very little alcohol from 1969 until 1993.  Applicant started drinking when
he began to experience marital problems.  In March 1995 his 27-year marriage ended in divorce. On
August 6, 1995, he was arrested for DUI with a blood alcohol content of .19% at the time of arrest. 
Applicant had 20 days of inpatient treatment from September 5, 1996 through September 24, 1996. 
The intensive outpatient program he entered on September 24, 1996 helped him remain sober 29
days.  He returned to drinking and was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on December
14, 1996.  His last drink was on December 15, 1996.</P>

<P>	His abstinence from all alcohol since December 15, 1996, is regarded as a positive change
in behavior supportive of sobriety. (See MC 3).  However, whereas Applicant has been diagnosed
as suffering from alcohol dependence, he is required for mitigation under the Adjudicative
Guidelines to successfully complete an inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare
requirements, participate frequently in AA or similar organization, abstain from alcohol for a period
of at least twelve months,  and receive a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional. 
Applicant has not abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months nor is there a favorable
prognosis by a credentialed professional.  </P>

<P>	Common sense may warrant a favorable outcome, notwithstanding the failure to satisfy
pertinent mitigating conditions.  Whether or not an applicant has reformed, depends on recognition
and acknowledgment of his alcohol problem, and demonstration by conduct over a measurable
period of time that he  is committed to his recovery.  As recently as December 15, 1996, Applicant
showed little insight into his alcohol problem, as evidenced by his consumption of two 6-packs of
beer following his release from jail.  His efforts in reform are too recent to overcome his very serious
history of drug abuse.</P>

<P>	The absence of any alcohol related incidents at his company<A HREF="96-0871.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> are to his credit, but it does not
mandate the grant of a clearance.  The responsibilities to safeguard classified information do not
cease at the end of the work day.  At this juncture, it is too soon to tell whether AA will provide a
viable support network for him in his recovery or to conclude that his alcohol dependence is safely
behind him.  Especially since Applicant is having difficulty accepting Step 1 of the AA program.</P>

<P>	With less than a year of sustained sobriety, it is still to soon to draw convincing conclusions
that Applicant is a safe risk to avert any recurrence of alcohol abuse in the foreseeable future.  So,
while Applicant is to be commended and encouraged in his efforts at seeking professional help for
his alcohol problems, he needs more time to persuasively season his commitments to stay sober and
away from alcohol abuse in the future.  </P>

<P>	For the present time, it is sufficient to conclude that Applicant's mitigation efforts, though
encouraging are not of sufficient strength and endurance to enable him to absorb the Government's
pressing security concerns associated with his past abuses of alcohol. </P>

<P>	Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. are resolved against him. </P>

<P>		<CENTER><STRONG><U>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are
hereby rendered as follows:</P>
