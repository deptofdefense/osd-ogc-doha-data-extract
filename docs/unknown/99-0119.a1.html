<P>Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason issued a decision, dated June 29, 1999, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by
finding against Applicant with respect to certain incidents for which the criminal charges were
dismissed or Applicant was acquitted; (2) whether the Administrative Judge failed to give due
weight to Applicant's honesty and candor with the government; and (3) whether the
Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
February 23, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion G (Alcohol Consumption).</P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR in which he indicated he wanted "a decision
without a hearing."  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.  A copy of the FORM
was given to Applicant.  No response to the FORM was received from Applicant.  The case
was assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="99-0119.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding against Applicant with respect to certain
incidents for which the criminal charges were dismissed or Applicant was acquitted</U>.  Applicant
asserts his various arrests do not show he has a record of alcohol abuse because he has not been
convicted for any of those incidents.  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate the
Administrative Judge erred in this case.</P>

<P>The fact that an applicant has been arrested or otherwise charged with a criminal offense,
standing alone, does not constitute proof the applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 98-0424 (July 16, 1999) at p. 4.  Accordingly, the fact that Applicant was
arrested on several occasions does not prove he engaged in the criminal conduct with which he
was charged.  However, the absence of a conviction does not preclude the government from
proving an applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April
30, 1999) at p. 7.  Furthermore, the fact that criminal charges were dropped, dismissed, or
resulted in an acquittal does not preclude an Administrative Judge from finding an applicant
engaged in the conduct underlying those criminal charges.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-0954
(October 16, 1995) at p. 4.</P>

<P>Considering the record as a whole, the Administrative Judge had sufficient record evidence to
find Applicant had engaged in episodic alcohol abuse or been involved in alcohol-related
incidents within the meaning of Criterion G.  For example, Applicant admitted abusing alcohol
of various occasions (FORM, Items 6 and 7).  In addition, various police reports contain
personal observations by police officers that are probative of alcohol abuse by Applicant
(FORM, Items 10, 13, 14, 16, 18).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0575 (July 22, 1997) at p. 3
("Police reports are admissible in civil proceedings as evidence of matters personally observed
by the reporting police officer, as well as factual findings resulting from an investigation made
pursuant to lawful authority.  Such material was admissible in these proceedings as an
exception to the hearsay rule.")(citations omitted).</P>

<P>Applicant also argues that his conduct is less threatening because it is only alcohol abuse and
not alcoholism.  The Board finds that argument unpersuasive since: (1) the Administrative
Judge did not find Applicant to be an alcoholic, (2) alcohol abuse is disqualifying conduct
under the Directive, and (3) Applicant's argument is based on new evidence.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to give due weight to Applicant's honesty and
candor with the government</U>.  Applicant asserts he has always cooperated with investigators,
and has truthfully answered all questions about his past to the best of his knowledge.  The
Board construes Applicant's assertions as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge
failed to give due weight to Applicant's honesty and candor with the government.</P>

<P>An applicant's honesty and candor with the government do not preclude the government from
considering the security significance of the applicant's admitted conduct.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case
No. 98-0685 (May 20, 1999) at p. 3.  The security significance of alcohol abuse is not reduced
or diminished merely because an applicant admits he or she has abused alcohol.  Accordingly,
Applicant's admissions about his drinking problems did not preclude the Administrative Judge
from evaluating Applicant's alcohol abuse and concluding that it had negative security
significance under Criterion G.</P>

<P>3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law</U>.  Applicant refers to his job performance and his military service record and contends that
he would not do anything to jeopardize the national security.  The Board construes this
contention as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>The favorable evidence cited by Applicant does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge's
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge must consider the record
evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable
evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0621 (August 19, 1999) at p. 3. 
Considering the record as a whole, the Judge did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in
weighing the evidence in this case.  Furthermore, the favorable evidence cited by Applicant did
not require the Judge, as a matter of law, to make a favorable security clearance decision.</P>

<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons
granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). 
Security clearance decisions include consideration of a person's judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness.  <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy</EM>, 284 F.2d 173,
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  A history of alcohol abuse, even if it occurs
during nonduty hours, provides a rational basis for the government to question an applicant's
security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g., Cole v. Young</EM>, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); <EM>Croft v.
Department of Air Force</EM>, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989).  The record evidence of
Applicant's history of episodic alcohol abuse provides a rational basis for the Administrative
Judge's adverse decision in this case.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> On appeal, Applicant proffers information about enrolling in an employee assistance
program to get alcohol counseling, and asserts he has abstained from alcohol for approximately
four months.  Those statements go beyond the record below.  Applicant also submitted with his
appeal brief a letter from his supervisor that was written after the Administrative Judge's
decision was issued.  Applicant's statements and his supervisor's letter constitute new evidence,
which the Board cannot consider.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 29. 
Applicant had the opportunity to present evidence in response to the FORM for consideration
by the Administrative Judge, but he did not do so.
