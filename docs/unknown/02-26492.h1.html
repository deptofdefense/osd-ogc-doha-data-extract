</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to
an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 20, 2003. The case was assigned to
the undersigned on January 29, 2004. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 17, 2004, and the
hearing was held on April 21, 2004. The transcript was received on May 7, 2004.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is 40 years of age. He is employed as an engineer by a defense contractor.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	Applicant was born in South Vietnam. In 1975, at about the time South Vietnam was falling
to the Communists, applicant, his parents, and 12 of his 15 siblings, fled Saigon with the help of the
U.S. military, and moved to the United States.<A HREF="02-26492.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant has lived in the United States since 1975.
He became a United States citizen in 1984.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's parents and all of his siblings reside in the United States. All became United
States citizens except one brother. The brother, described by applicant as the "black sheep" of the
family, will be applying for United States citizenship.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In 1995, applicant married a woman who was born in Vietnam. She became a United States
citizen in June 2001. Applicant's five year old son was born in the United States. He was applicant's
parents' thirtieth grandchild. All of the grandchildren are United States citizens.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Vietnam. Applicant
and his wife are in the process of helping the in-laws immigrate to the United States. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Since moving to the United States, applicant has visited Vietnam numerous times, the last
time about two years ago. He has no current plans to travel there (TR at 27).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	It is clear from the evidence that applicant is extremely grateful for the life he has in the
United States, and that he is a loyal United States citizen. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant was born in Vietnam. In 1975, he and his family fled Vietnam immediately prior
to the communist takeover of the country and moved to the United States. In 1984, he became a
United States citizen. His wife, who was also born in Vietnam, became a United States citizen in
2001. Their child was born in the United States. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	All of applicant's immediate family members live in the United States. All of them, except
one brother, are United States citizens. The one sibling who is not a United States citizen is a citizen
of Vietnam. This fact requires application of Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1 <EM>(An immediate
family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a
citizen of, or resident of or present in, a foreign country)</EM>. Based on the evidence presented, I
conclude that this one immediate family member is not an agent of Vietnam, or in a position to be
exploited by Vietnam in a way that could force applicant to choose between loyalty to him and
loyalty to the United States. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1 <EM>(a determination that
the immediate family member(s) . . . in question</EM> <EM>are not agents of a foreign power or in a position
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty
to the person(s) involved and the United States) </EM>is applicable to this case.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The evidence clearly establishes that applicant and his immediate family members are
anticommunist. They are extremely grateful for the opportunities they have been afforded since
moving to the United States, and as evidenced by the large number of extended family members that
have been born and raised in the United States since applicant and his family moved here in 1975,
the United States is their home. It is clear that applicant's loyalty is to the United States, and that he
would not allow his relationship to any Vietnamese citizen to undermine that loyalty.</P>
