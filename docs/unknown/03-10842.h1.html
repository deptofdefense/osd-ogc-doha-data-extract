<P>Applicant's financial indebtedness has not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On December 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 19, 2003, in which she elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a 
hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on April 16, 2004.  The Applicant was 
instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on April 28, 2004, and she 
submitted no reply.</P> 
 
<P>The case was transferred to the undersigned for resolution on June 21, 2004. </P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 34 years old.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Security Officer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with 
her employment.</P> 
 
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  Each of the debts listed are still owed and remain delinquent.  The Applicant is also indebted 
to other creditors not listed in the SOR.  The Applicant's financial statement indicates that she receives welfare and food stamps.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 5).  
She states that her financial situation is dismal and she cannot afford to pay her delinquent past due debts at this time.  She hopes someday to improve her 
financial situation.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 5).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a civil judgment entered against her in August 2000, in the approximate amount of $4,154.41.  As of April 2003, this 
debt had not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in April 2000, in the approximate amount of $47.00.  As of March 2003, this debt had 
not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in May 2002, in the approximate amount of $74.00.  As of March 2003, this debt had 
not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 3)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in September 2001, in the approximate amount of $188.00.  As of March 2003, this 
debt has not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in September 2001, in the approximate amount of $172.00.  As of March 2003, this 
debt had not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in August 2001, in the approximate amount of $721.00.  As of March 2003, this debt 
had not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account placed in collection in August 2001, in the approximate amount of $244.00.  As of March 2003, this debt 
had not been paid.  This debt remains outstanding.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Item 3)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
 
<P>3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant was financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor 
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a 
nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to her finances, the Applicant has a history of excessive indebtedness and has made no effort to pay her outstanding debts or to further resolve his 
financial situation.  The Applicant is on welfare and receives food stamps, so it is difficult for her to pay her past due debts.  The Applicant's total indebtedness 
in excess of $5,600.00.  She indicates that her present financial situation does not allow her to pay her delinquent debts at this time. Disqualifying conditions 
(DC)1, a history of not meeting financial obligations; and (DC) 3, an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts apply and have not been mitigated.  The 
Applicant's financial problems remain current; (MC)1, they are not isolated, (MC) 2, and the Applicant has not initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC) 3.  Consequently, I must find that none of the mitigation factors set forth in the Directive under Guideline F apply.  
Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.   </SPAN></P>
