  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Absent a showing that Applicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider, Applicant is not entitled to another opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.  Given the record evidence concerning  Applicant's contacts and ties with his mother and in-laws who are Iranian citizens and who reside in Iran, Applicant has not shown the Judge acted in an  arbitrary and capricious manner with respect to Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  Apart from one harmless error, the Judge's application of Foreign  Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 is sustainable.  A past decision to grant or continue a security clearance does not give rise to any right or vested interest in a  security clearance.  Board does not review cases de novo.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Robert R. Sparks, Jr., Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 3, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Paul J. Mason issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated May 17, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the case should be remanded to the Administrative Judge in order to develop the record 
concerning factual developments that have occurred since the hearing; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1 did not apply to mitigate Applicant's case; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in his application of Foreign Influence Disqualifying 
Condition 2; (4) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary and capricious in light of the fact that Applicant was 
granted a prior security clearance under like or arguably less favorable circumstances and nothing of a derogatory nature has happened since; and (5) whether 
Applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that Applicant is worthy of a security clearance.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the 
Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the case should be remanded to the Administrative Judge in order to develop the record concerning factual developments that have occurred since 
the hearing</SPAN>.  The case concerns the circumstances of a member of Applicant's immediate family and several in-laws who have various connections with Iran 
through Iranian citizenship or residence in Iran.  Applicant's appeal brief makes factual assertions about matters arising after the hearing and not part of the 
record below.  Applicant presents these factual assertions as casting Applicant's case in a more favorable light<A HREF="03-24144.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and asserts that the facts found by the 
Administrative Judge have been "overtaken by events."  One of Applicant's prayers for relief is a request that the case be remanded to the Administrative Judge 
so that the record may be developed concerning the new, post-hearing developments.</P> 
<P>The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Thus, the Board will not consider new 
evidence cited by Applicant when evaluating Applicant's appeal arguments.  Moreover, Applicant has not articulated a basis for reopening the record in this 
case.  Absent a showing that Applicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider, Applicant is not 
entitled to another opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-30603 (February 25, 2004) at p. 3.  A review of the record below 
shows that Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in his case.  Furthermore, Applicant's claim that 
his situation has changed since the hearing does not warrant a remand to the Judge with instructions to open the record so that Applicant can present additional 
evidence.  If DOHA was required to open a case merely because a party claims there has been a change in circumstances since the hearing, there would be little 
chance of achieving administrative finality in security clearance cases.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-17114 (November 29, 2004) at p. 3 (citing <EM>Vermont Yankee 
Nuclear Power Corp</EM>. <EM>v</EM>. <EM>Natural Resources Defense Council</EM>, <EM>Inc</EM>., 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 (1978)).  Regarding remand, Applicant has not demonstrated he is 
entitled to the relief he seeks.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-24144.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> did not apply to mitigate Applicant's case</SPAN>.  At the time of 
the hearing, Applicant's mother was a citizen and resident of Iran.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's mother had close ties of affection to 
Applicant, and this conclusion is not challenged by Applicant on appeal.  However, Applicant asserts that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to  
conclude that the second prong of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 did not apply.  Applicant argues that the Judge erroneously relied on evidence that 
Applicant's mother had been contacted by the Iranian regime sometime prior to 1985 in reaching his conclusion that she was in a position of vulnerability.  
Applicant's assertion lacks merit.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge clearly included in his analysis the fact that, Department Counsel having established its<EM> </EM>case under the Foreign Influence Guideline, 
Applicant had the burden of showing his family members living in Iran did not pose a security concern.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.15.  He also factored in evidence that at one point in the past, Applicant's mother was approached by the Iranian regime because she had been married to a 
United States citizen (Applicant's father) and the mother explained that she was divorced and asked to be left alone.  However, the decision below indicates the 
Judge did not rely solely on the evidence concerning Applicant's mother being approached by the Iranian government in the past.  Rather, the Judge also 
considered the facts and circumstances of Applicant's contacts with his mother, her Iranian citizenship, and her residence in Iran.</P> 
<P>Applicant also asserts that the Administrative Judge should have applied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 to the circumstances of Applicant's in-laws, 
which include his father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law.<A HREF="03-24144.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant does not specify what evidence required the Judge to conclude 
that the mitigating condition applied nor does Applicant specifically state how the Judge's failure to apply it was error.  Without specifically referencing 
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, the Judge concluded that the potential existed for pressure to be placed on the in-laws that could then be extended to 
Applicant through Applicant's wife.  Given the record evidence, Applicant has not shown that the Judge's conclusions in this regard are arbitrary or capricious.</P> 
<P>In a related argument, Applicant takes exception to the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant was potentially vulnerable to pressure or influence 
because of the circumstances of his in-laws.  Applicant asserts that the Judge's concern was "too attenuated," speculative, and that his reasoning was arbitrary 
and capricious.  Applicant's argument on this point is not persuasive.  The Board has recognized that, as a matter of common sense and human experience, 
there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 01-03120 (February 20, 2002) at p. 4.  Accordingly, the Administrative Judge did not err in considering the immediate family members of Applicant's 
spouse as raising security concerns similar to those raised by the presence of Applicant's mother in Iran.</P> 
<P>3.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in his application of Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2</SPAN>.<A HREF="03-24144.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  At the time of the hearing, none of Applicant's 
in-laws were living with him in the United States.  The Administrative Judge found, however, that Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law alternate 
between residing in the United States and residing in Iran, and at the time of hearing they were in Iran visiting a sick relative.  The Judge found that Applicant's 
brother-in-law shares Applicant's dwelling when he is in the United States, and he last lived with Applicant for about six months in 2004 before returning to 
Iran to finish an internship.  The Judge then noted that it was Applicant's belief that the brother-in-law would return to the United States to pursue a career.  
Regarding Applicant's sister-in-law, the Judge made no finding that she ever lived with Applicant or his wife or that she was planning to do so in the future.  
Based on these findings, the Judge concluded that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 applied to the case and that Applicant was vulnerable to 
influence through his parents-in-law and his siblings-in-law.</P> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 applied was erroneous.  He asserts 
that the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 is wrong because none of Applicant's in-laws live with Applicant.  Additionally, 
Applicant asserts that his parents-in-law are United States citizens who live chiefly in the United States, the brother-in-law cannot be said to be "sharing living 
quarters" with Applicant, and his sister-in-law has never lived with Applicant.  </P> 
<P>With the exception of the sister-in-law, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Administrative Judge to apply Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 to 
Applicant's in-laws.  The Judge's finding that Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law alternate their residency between Applicant's residence in the 
United States and residing in Iran is supported by record evidence and provides a sufficient basis for the Judge's conclusion that Disqualifying Condition 2 
applies.  Likewise, the circumstance of Applicant's brother-in-law, who resided with Applicant previously and has prospects for returning to the United States, 
also supports the Judge's application of the Disqualifying Condition.  Inasmuch as there is no evidence that Applicant's sister-in-law has ever lived with 
Applicant or has prospects for doing so in the future, the Judge's application of the Disqualifying Condition to her was erroneous.  However, the Board regards 
this error as harmless in light of other findings and conclusions of the Judge that are sustainable.</P> 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary and capricious in light of the fact that Applicant was granted a prior 
security clearance under like or arguably less favorable circumstances, and nothing of a derogatory nature has happened since</SPAN>.  Applicant notes that his earlier 
application for a security clearance was granted and he held the clearance for eleven years between 1985 and 1996 without incident, even though his mother's 
contact with Iranian authorities was far more recent at that time, and should not suffice to deny him a clearance now if it was insufficient to deny him a 
clearance then.  He asserts his mother is less likely to be pressured now than she was when he last held a clearance.  Regarding the circumstances of his wife 
and in-laws, Applicant argues that there was plenty of opportunity in the past, when he held a clearance, for the Iranian authorities to try to pressure him by way 
of his wife through his in-laws, but that did not happen and there is no reason to believe it might happen in the future.</P> 
<P>There is no right to a security clearance, and a past decision to grant or continue a security clearance does not give rise to any right or vested interest in a 
security clearance.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-19823 (December 3, 2003) at p. 5.  Furthermore, a favorable security clearance decision does not preclude the 
federal government from reassessing a person's security eligibility in light of current circumstances.  Given the record evidence in this case, which includes 
evidence of Applicant's and his wife's continuing contacts with citizens and/or residents of Iran, the Administrative Judge was not precluded from evaluating 
Applicant's security eligibility and reaching an unfavorable decision.  Facts and circumstances that raise security concerns about an applicant's security 
eligibility can warrant an adverse security clearance decision without any proof that a foreign intelligence or security service has specifically targeted the 
applicant or sought to exploit those facts and circumstances.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-16516 (November 26, 2004) at p. 7.  Even in the absence of any 
evidence that the Iranian government has targeted Applicant in the past, the Judge was entitled to consider whether the totality of Applicant's contacts and ties 
with his mother and in-laws raised security concerns under the Foreign Influence Guideline that shifted the burden of persuasion for a favorable security 
clearance decision to Applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Applicant's arguments in this area fail to establish error on the 
part of the Administrative Judge.</P> 
<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that Applicant is worthy of a security clearance</SPAN>.  Applicant makes the following two 
assertions on appeal: (a) because of his mother's present circumstances, the Board may safely discount her as a pressure point for the Applicant; and (b) his past 
laudatory history as a security clearance holder should permit the Board the Board to grant the requested clearance.  The Board construes these statements as a 
request by the Applicant for it to make its own evaluation of the facts and circumstances of this case and then decide whether Applicant is eligible for a security 
clearance.  As has been stated previously, the Board does not engage in <EM>de novo </EM>review when deciding appeals.  The scope of the Board's authority is limited to 
a determination of whether the challenged findings and conclusions of the Administrative Judge are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law and to a 
determination of whether remand or reversal is required in cases where the challenging party has successfully demonstrated error.  Here, for the reasons cited in 
previous sections of this decision, Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the Judge that warrants remand or reversal.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has not met his burden of establishing error on the part of the Administrative Judge that warrants remand or reversal.  Accordingly, the Board affirms 
the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
