<P>Applicant with a long history of debts attributable to both periods of unemployment and family medical problems (evidence of extenuating circumstances) 
provides no documented efforts to either pay on the bulk of his debts or resolve his debts by consolidation or repayment plan consistent with his ability to pay 
on his old debts and fails to provide sufficient documentation and discharge assurances of  his post-hearing bankruptcy petition to carry his evidentiary burden 
at this time.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 28, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on December 19, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on February 6, 2002, and 
on February 11, 2002, was scheduled for hearing (amended on February 20, 2002 as to location).  A hearing was convened on March 1, 2002, for the purpose of 
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the 
Government's case consisted of ten exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings 
was received on March 12, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave for the record to be kept open to permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with 
documentation of consulting with Consumer Credit Counseling ("CCC") and character references.  There being no objections, and good cause being shown, 
Applicant was granted an additional seven (7) days in which to supplement the record.  Government was granted two (2) days to respond.  Within the time 
permitted to supplement the record, Applicant elected not to supplement the record with either CCC documentation or character references.  He did, however 
(albeit beyond the permitted time for supplementing) provide a cover note and confirming notice of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in April 2002: copies 
of the petition of Applicant and his spouse and accompanying schedules were not provided.  Government interposed no objection to Applicant's notice of filing 
for Chapter 7 relief under the US Bankruptcy Code.  Applicant's faxed correspondence and attached notice of petition are accepted as exhibit B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 32-year old senior engineering analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have accumulated numerous debts on creditor accounts that have become delinquent and are yet to be paid: They comprise six loan and 
credit card debts exceeding $15,000.00 in delinquent accounts, and additional delinquent obligation owed to a veterinarian group in the amount of $236.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations without any accompanying explanations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in 1993, Applicant was laid off from his engineering job.   After looking for work in his career field for over six months, and finding no success, he 
exhausted his savings and ultimately became too strapped for finances to pay his accrued his accrued debts: six loan and credit card debts exceeding $15,000.00 
in the aggregate and a vet bill of $236.00.  Facing a career change in lower paying work, he elected to allocate his scarce money to paying for the vehicles he 
needed for acceptance of job bids: This meant putting his old debts on hold.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After consulting with Credit Counseling Services ("CCC") on a possible debt consolidation several years ago, Applicant was told he didn't make enough 
money to fashion a workable debt consolidation program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994, Applicant accepted a position with a local contractor at a significantly reduced level of compensation: $16,000.00 a year, an annual package 
considerably below the $24,000.00 he was accustomed to earning before his layoff.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married in 1996 and accepted the caring responsibility for his new spouse's daughter from another marriage.  He and his spouse, in turn, produced a 
little girl from their own marriage.  His spouse remained home to care for the two children.  Besides the additional burdens of normal child rearing Applicant 
assumed, he soon became financially responsible for the medical expenses associated with a series of debilitating nasal polyps suffered by his stepdaughter that 
required medicinal treatment.  Other medical problems have also confronted Applicant following his marriage.  His spouse, for instance, continues to 
experience bi-polar depression that requires matching co-payments as a condition of their medical insurance.  These expenses, along with his other health care 
and current expenses associated with his taking care of his general family needs and vehicle purchased for work purposes, have precluded his addressing any of 
his older debts with his current income sources.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To resolve his old debts, Applicant actively considered bankruptcy and worked as much overtime as his employer will allow.  Furnished credit reports have 
enlightened him considerably on the poor state of his finances.  He has managed to cobble together enough money to make a couple of payments on one of his 
covered credit card debts, but he is basically able at this time with his present income to do no more than take care of his current debts, to include his ongoing 
medical obligations.  He rents a townhouse and owns a 1989 vehicle outright (worth about $2,500.00), as he continues to make payments on a mini van he is 
purchasing.  He also has an IRA worth approximately $3,500.00.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant still is unable to provide any documentation of his medical expenses for his wife and stepdaughter and fails to provide any documentation of his 
expenses within the time permitted.  So, just what kind of a debt load he has been carrying with his medical commitments is less than clear.  This is not to doubt 
his claims of medical assistance, just the relative level of monetary commitment he has been obligated to these past few years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To date, Applicant has made no visible efforts to contact his old creditors about working out  individual payment plans and has failed to return to CCC for 
counseling advice for resolving his old debts.  While considering bankruptcy, he had until his post-hearing election declined to take any affirmative steps 
towards any filing for bankruptcy relief under either a Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 regime: leaving himself at the close of the hearing with essentially no plan in 
place for resolving his old debts in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the hearing, Applicant has reconsidered and petitioned for Chapter 7 relief under the US Bankruptcy Code.  Because he provided no copy of his petition 
and accompanying schedules listing his assets and debts, it is impossible without much conjecture to know what debts he seeks to discharge, much less to 
predict with any degree of reasonable accuracy whether he can be relied upon to follow through with a discharge.  Without more in the record to evaluate the 
scope of his Chapter 7 petition and his likelihood of emerging with a successful discharge, favorable inferences are not feasible at this late stage of the 
proceedings.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the 
Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual 
inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a history of debt delinquencies that raise security concerns about not only his vulnerability to pressures and 
influence to raise money to discharge his debts, but his overall reliability and trustworthiness in regaining control of his finances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What is at issue in this proceeding is Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness in light of his debt history, which to date he has not been able to seriously 
address.  Security determinations have never confined risk considerations to the elimination of debts that result from isolated payment lapses linked to exigent 
circumstances, but rather it has looked to the applicant's overall financial history to shed light on his most recent conduct as an indicator of his recurrence risks.  
This the Government has done in its underscoring of Applicant's still ongoing financial difficulties associated with his continued inability to address his old 
debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appraising the security significance of Applicant's financial deficiencies, a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (for 
financial consideration) are applicable.  With respect to his covered debts, DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 2  (inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be fair, Applicant may rightfully claim extenuation under the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Each of the listed debts were extenuated some by Applicant's 
financial circumstances attending his layoff and ensuing  medical problems, and are partially absorbed of security concerns by application of MC 3 
(circumstances beyond Applicant's control, such as unemployment and medical emergency).  But with his present employment, more effort could reasonably 
have been expected of Applicant to pursue debt consolidation or even bankruptcy to address his old debts.  This, he has not been able to demonstrate, even 
within the time permitted to supplement the record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Overall assessment of Appellant's finances is extenuating, but not mitigating enough to make any safe predictions he  can be entrusted to stabilize his finances 
in the foreseeable future.  Payment efforts are still very limited and necessarily invite considerable unpredictability over the core issue of whether he will be 
able to sustain his repayment assurances of addressing his old debts any time soon.  His post-hearing election to seek Chapter 7 relief under the US Bankruptcy 
Code is encouraging, but with too little documentation of the details and necessary progress in the petition to warrant the safe assurances of follow-through 
necessary to facilitate positive, predictive judgments at this time about his success probabilities.  Applicant may certainly take some advantage of one of the 
itigating Conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (for financial): MC 3 (behavior largely beyond the person's control, such as unemployment), but no more 
at this time given the insufficiency of visible steps to resolve his old debts, and not enough overall mitigation to absolve him of continuing security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Everything considered, Applicant's lack of any repayment efforts or other measures to take control of his old debts by resolution means short of individual 
payment (such as consolidation and petitioned for bankruptcy that either produces a discharge or is demonstrably likely to produce one) are insufficient at this 
time to successfully mitigate any residual judgment and reliability concerns associated with his debt delinquencies, extenuated though most of them appear to 
be.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.h of Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
