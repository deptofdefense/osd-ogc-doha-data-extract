<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 12 May 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR), under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="01-17066.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-17066.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in 
writing on 17 June 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 6 August 2003.  On 25 September 2003, 
I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 3 October 2003.</P>

<P>Applicant's father was an alcoholic.  While Applicant was in the U.S. Navy, he reported for work intoxicated on approximately three occasions, but no one 
noticed.  From 1972 to 1990, Applicant drank six to eight beers at a time, three or four times weekly.  Ex. 2 at 4.  In 1974 or 1975, he admitted himself to a six-week in-patient Navy alcohol treatment program.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5; Tr. 34.  Applicant was arrested for driving while under the influence (DUI) in 1984/85.  The court 
ordered him to attend an Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP). Ex. 2 at 5.  From 1990 to 1994, Applicant consumed in excess of 12 beers a day.  On 
Saturdays, he often drank 24 beers.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4.  In 1993 and 1994, Applicant was again arrested for DUI.  After each incident, a court ordered him to attend ASAP.  
<EM>Id.</EM> at 5; Answer; Tr. 26-33.  After his 1994 DUI, Applicant did not consume alcoholic beverages for five years.  </P> 
 
<P>Since 1999, he has resumed consumption of alcoholic beverages.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4.  His excessive consumption of alcohol contributed to his financial problems.  Ex. 2 at 
5.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.a. - 1.e.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  DC 1.  He was unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts.  DC 2.  Some of his financial problems 
were linked to his excessive consumption of alcohol.  <EM>See</EM> DC 5.  Applicant seems rather cavalier about his debts.  In April 2001, Applicant was notified of the 
delinquent debts appearing on his credit report.  <EM>See</EM> Ex. 2.  He claims that he is unaware of the nature of some of his debts, yet he has not made a concerted 
effort to investigate.  He admits that he is financially unable to pay some of his debts.  Tr. 21.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Finding is against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested for DWI on three occasions (&para; 2.a. - 2.c.) and continues to drink up to four alcoholic drinks a day (&para;2.d.).  
Excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, 
and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations contained in &para; 2 of the SOR.  Applicant's DUIs were alcohol-related incidents away 
from work.  DC 1.  Applicant has had a severe drinking problem.  It is a mitigating condition if the alcohol problem occurred a number of years ago and there is 
no indication of a recent problem.  MC 2.  Although Applicant has not had an alcohol-related incident since 1994, I am unable to conclude there is "no 
indication of a recent problem."  After five years of abstinence, Applicant returned to consuming alcoholic beverages in 1999.  He insists he no longer craves 
alcohol and does not drive after drinking.  Nevertheless, it is not clear that his alcohol problems are over.  Applicant's recitation of his current drinking habits is 
inconsistent.  In April 2001, Applicant made a signed, sworn statement in which he claimed he </SPAN>now consumes four or five beers on two or three occasions a 
week.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ex. 2 at 4.  In interrogatories he answered under oath on 5 June 2002, he stated he now consumes three or four beers daily when he gets home from 
work.  Ex. 4 at 5.  At his 25 September 2003 hearing, he testified that, "Since [1994] I only drink socially with acquaintances at the Moose Lodge ...."  After 
carefully weighing all the evidence, I am not convinced Applicant has demonstrated that he has conquered his drinking problem or sufficiently mitigated the 
security concerns associated with his excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
