<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey-Anderson issued a decision, dated June 30, 1998, in which she concluded it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed. 
For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992 as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to
law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 27, 1997 to Applicant. 
The SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations), Criterion E (Personal Conduct), and Criterion J (Criminal
Conduct).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the time that he provided an answer to the SOR, Applicant elected to have his case determined on a written record
instead of a hearing.  The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on March 13,
1998.  Applicant submitted a reply to the FORM on April 28, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a
written decision, dated June 30, 1998.  The Judge found that Applicant had a history of financial irresponsibility.  She also
found  he had provided intentional falsifications of his financial history to the Government during a background
investigation.  The Judge concluded that Applicant's history and actions warranted formal findings against Applicant
under Criteria E, F, and J.  The Judge finally concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="97-0730.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U>Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</U>  On appeal, Applicant
asserts: (a) he has been accused of owing debts which were either paid or were never his debts; (b) the Administrative
Judge never discussed the fact that Applicant's ex-wife was responsible for the running up of his debts and his inability to
pay them; (c) the Administrative Judge did not mention the fact that Applicant earned only $1200.00 his first year out of
the service and was thus unable to resolve his debts; (d) he never intentionally misled anyone about his 1991 bankruptcy
petition; (e) he is an honest and hard worker; and (f) his 1981 bankruptcy should not now be held against him.  The Board
construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious or
contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is ample evidence in the case record to support the Judge's findings in those instances where she found that
Applicant owed certain debts.  It should be noted that the Judge found in Applicant's favor in two subparagraphs (1.c. and
1.l) under Criterion F where there was either evidence of repayment or insufficient evidence that Applicant still owed the
debts listed in the SOR.  Thus, any inaccurate assertions of debt contained in the SOR were cured by the Judge's scrutiny
of the record evidence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's contention that the Judge never considered the role that his ex-wife played in his debt problems does not
establish error.  Although the Judge never specifically discusses Applicant's assertion that his ex-wife was largely to
blame for his debts, she did find that most of Applicant's debts were incurred before 1991 during an earlier marriage
(Decision at p. 3).  The Judge also acknowledged in the "Conclusions" portion of her decision that Applicant disputes
some of his debts, yet never took steps to resolve the disputed debts.  (Decision at p. 7).  The Judge's adverse holding
against Applicant under Criterion F is correctly based upon his failure to pay any undisputed debts <STRONG>and</STRONG> his failure to
resolve any debts that he does not consider his.  The Judge's decision makes clear that she considered Applicant's assertion
that his debt problems were, at least in part, not of his own making.  Her conclusion that this assertion was insufficient to
mitigate the case against Applicant was reasonable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant complains on appeal that the Judge did not mention the facts that he only earned $1200.00 during the year
following his discharge from the service and that this paucity of income affected his ability to manage his debts.  It is true
that there is no mention of these specific facts in the Judge's decision.  Nevertheless, there is a rebuttable presumption that
the Judge considered all the evidence in the case unless there is clear indication to the contrary.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.
97-0783 (August 7, 1998) at p. 4.  Furthermore, there is no requirement that a Judge mention each and every item of
evidence contained in the record when deciding a case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DOHA Case No. 90-1596 (September 18, 1992) at p. 5. 
A reading of the Judge's decision in this case reveals that she was aware, at the time of the close of the record in this case,
that Applicant's current income was insufficient for him to meaningfully resolve his outstanding debts.  The fact that she
did not conclude that Applicant's limited income was a factor in mitigation and extenuation was not error because of the
record evidence that Applicant did not intend to pay his delinquent debts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On appeal, Applicant proffers that he never intentionally tried to mislead anyone about his 1991 bankruptcy petition. 
However, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the Judge's findings that Applicant intentionally failed to
reveal the true extent of his financial difficulties on Government security questionnaires.  When filling out two
questionnaires four years apart Applicant omitted not only the fact of his bankruptcy filing but also his many debt
delinquencies.  The decision indicates that the Judge carefully considered the documentary evidence as well as Applicant's
explanation for the various omissions from the questionnaires.  After consideration, the Judge concluded that Applicant's
explanations were not credible.  (Decision at p. 4).  Here, a review of the record evidence leads the Board to conclude that
the Judge's findings and conclusions with regard to Criterion E are reasonable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant cites his honesty and his job performance as matters in mitigation.  There is no evidence in the record that deals
with Applicant's job performance and the only record evidence bearing on Applicant's honesty is the evidence concerning
his falsifications.  The Board will not conclude a Judge erred based on factual assertions made on appeal that do not have
any support in the record evidence.  Given the state of the record evidence, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge
to conclude that Applicant failed to overcome the Government's case against him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant contends that his initial Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, which was 17 years old at the time of the close of the
record in this case, should not now be held against him.  This argument is without merit.  In a case involving a
longstanding pattern of financial difficulty, it is obviously relevant for the Judge to consider a 1981 Chapter 13
bankruptcy, especially where it is part of a continuing history of financial woes that was still unresolved when the record
evidence was closed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the
Administrative Judge's June 30, 1998 decision.</FONT></P>
