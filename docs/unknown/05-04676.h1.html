<P>Applicant's falsification of her clearance application and financial irresponsibility renders her an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 28 October 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of financial 
considerations and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 1 December 2005, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 17 February 2006, and I convened a hearing  29 March 
2006. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 10 April 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 41-year-old communication specialist for a defense contractor since February 2000. 
She has never applied for a clearance before. She was divorced from her first husband in June 1998 and remarried in July 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for her security clearance in February 2004,<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> she answered "no" to six questions (questions 34-39) seeking adverse financial information within the last seven years. In fact, 
Applicant knew that she had several accounts that were past due and should have been reported as 90- or 180-days past due (questions 38 and 39). These include a debt for unpaid rent that resulted in 
her being evicted from the apartment in 1998 (SOR 1.d.), a debt for an unpaid cable bill at the same address (SOR 1.c.),<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and a December 1997 deficiency judgment for a repossessed automobile (SOR 
1.b.). Applicant asserts that she was not aware that the repossession deficiency had been reduced to judgment. However, she was aware that there was a deficiency amount on the repossession, she was 
aware that her husband had agreed to take responsibility for the debt in their divorce settlement, and she was aware that her husband had not continued to make payments as he was required. In her 
October 2004 sworn statement (G.E. 3) she did not claim to have been unaware of her past due accounts when she was discussing her adverse financial history with the investigator. Further, she offers 
no credible explanation for her failure to disclose any of these delinquent accounts in response to questions 38 and 39.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The four debts alleged in the SOR total nearly $19,000. Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to her 1998 divorce, but tax lien (SOR 1.a.) and the automobile repossession (SOR 1.b.)  were joint 
debt--incurred before the divorce--that her ex-husband agreed to pay. That agreement might give Applicant a claim against her husband for his failure to pay, but would not extinguish the creditors' 
rights to pursue payment from her. The past due cable bill (SOR 1.c.) and rent (SOR 1.d.)  were individual debts she incurred before the divorce. She claims that she moved and never got the bills, but 
there is no indication she gave those creditors her new address. Further, she was evicted from the apartment for non-payment of rent, so she knew she was obligated to that creditor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her October 2004 sworn statement, Applicant claimed that she had reached repayment schedules with the creditors at 1.b. ($200 per month beginning November 2004), 1.c. ($100 per month 
beginning November 2004), and 1.d. ($200 per month beginning November 2004). Applicant's financial statement showed approximately $1,500.00 per month positive cash flow, more than enough to 
meet these scheduled. However, she paid on the account at 1.b. for only two months and did not satisfy the creditor until March 2006, when she made a lump sum payment of $14,000 (A.E. A, 
B)--funded by her husband's refinancing of his home. She made no payments to the creditor at 1.c. until November 2005, when she paid the account in full (answer). She made no payments to the 
creditor at 1.d. until August 2005, when she paid the account in full (answer). In September 2005, she reached a repayment agreement with the state tax lien (answer), and corroborated that she had 
made the scheduled payments through the date of the hearing (A.E. C). The amount owed includes both the joint taxes that her husband failed to pay and her own, later past due taxes.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a Guideline F case under disqualifying conditions 1 and 3,<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although her divorce may have exacerbated her financial 
problems, the debts alleged in the SOR were all incurred before her divorce.<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant made no effort to pay her past due rent and cable bill. Although her husband was responsible under their divorce 
settlement to pay the tax debt and the automobile deficiency, she did not take any action to ensure that he paid these debts as agreed, and when she discovered that he had not paid them as agreed, she 
did not follow-up on her obligation to pay them. Even though she was clearly aware of the automobile deficiency, past due rent, and past due cable bill in October 2004, and had negotiated repayment 
schedules with these creditors, she failed to pay as scheduled. This delay does not demonstrate good faith in addressing her debts.<A HREF="05-04676.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Rather, Applicant appears to have addressed some of her debts (1.b. 
and 1.c. 1.) only because of the SOR and pending hearing. This is irresponsible financial behavior and suggests that Applicant is unwilling to meet her financial obligations unless compelled to. I 
conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant's clearance application gives no hint of her substantial financial trouble and she has 
offered no credible explanation for her failure to disclose that information to the government. It does not appear that she sought to disclose the adverse financial information between the time she 
completed her clearance application and her October 2004 subject interview. Nor does it appear she disclosed the financial information before being presented with the adverse credit report during her 
subject interview. I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
