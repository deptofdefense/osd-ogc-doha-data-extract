<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 23 August 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-08828.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 7 September 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 28 October 
2004.  On 15 December 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 21 December 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old information technology specialist for a defense contractor.</P> 
<P>Applicant's mother, EE, was born and raised in the U.S. as a Jew.  In 1966, EE married a Jordanian and resided in Jordan.  In 1969, after she became pregnant 
with Applicant, EE decided to return to the U.S. for Applicant's birth.  EE never returned to the Middle East.  EE and Applicant's father, who was a Ph. D. 
candidate at a U.S. university, separated in 1973 and ultimately divorced.  Applicant had little contact with her father thereafter.  He did not provide child 
support and played no part in her upbringing.  Applicant's mother raised Applicant while working as a corporate compliance manager for a defense contractor.  
She held a top secret security clearance for two years.  In 1980, EE married a retired U.S. Air Force officer with service in both the Korean and Vietnam wars.  
He is employed as an inspector in a federal agency.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's father was and is an archeologist and professor who taught at a university in Jordan, but had ties to museums and universities in the U.S. where he 
would lecture and teach.  On rare occasions he visited Applicant. </P> 
<P>In approximately 1982, Applicant visited Jordan for three weeks as a tourist.  She stayed with her father and his family--his second wife and their two children.  
During Applicant's stay in Jordan, it became known to some of Applicant's father's friends and colleagues that she was Jewish.  After the Gulf War in 1991, 
Applicant's father was questioned by friends and colleagues about having been married to a Jew, Applicant's mother.  EE asked Applicant to sponsor her father 
and his family into the U.S.  She did so.  But Applicant never participated in the citizenship interviews and did not attend her father's swearing in.  She remains 
in contact with her father, mostly by e-mail on a monthly basis.  She considers her step-father to be her parent as he helped raise and support her through her 
formative years.</P> 
<P>Applicant's father travels to Jordan twice a year for a month at a time to teach and do archeological research.  He suffered a heart attack a short time ago while 
he was working in Jordan.  He has remained in Jordan for treatment.  Applicant's father and his family are dual U.S.-Jordanian citizens.  Applicant's half-brother is a chemical engineer and her half-sister is a physician.  Applicant's half-sister recently gave birth to a child who was born in the U.S.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father, step-mother, half-brother and half-sister are dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S. currently residing in the U.S. (&para; 
1.a) and her father travels to Jordan once or twice a year for about a month at a time (&para; 1.b).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline B--Applicant's 
father, stepmother, half-brother, and half-sister are citizens of Jordan, and Applicant's father is present in Jordan.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This is not the typical foreign influence case.  In this case, the "foreign associates" are actually U.S. citizens who reside in the U.S.  While their dual citizenship 
makes them "citizens of a foreign country," I doubt the drafters of the Directive meant to include such dual citizenship, on its own, as raising a security concern.  
After all, a security concern is raised by an applicant with dual citizenship only if the applicant exercises that dual citizenship.  <EM>See</EM> Guideline C--Foreign 
Preference DC E2.A3.1.2.1.  There is no evidence Applicant's father, stepmother, half-sister, or half-brother exercised their dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if being a dual citizen is sufficient to raise a foreign influence security concern, such concerns may be mitigated when it is determined the person is not an 
agent of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person 
involved and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  Applicant's foreign associates are not "agents of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b).  And, accept 
for her father, who is present in Jordan and travels to Jordan twice a year, are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The real issue here is the presence of Applicant's father in Jordan now, and his routine trips there twice a year.  Applicant contends her "contact and 
correspondence" with her father and the rest of his family is "casual and infrequent.  <EM>See</EM> MC E2.A2.1.3.3.  There is a presumption that an applicant's 
association with members of her own family are not casual and infrequent.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant successfully 
rebutted that presumption.  Although Applicant acknowledges her father, and sponsored him and his family in becoming U.S. citizens, it was at her mother's 
request.  Applicant does not have the depth of attachment or obligation to her father or his family that represents a security concern.  I find for Applicant.  </SPAN></P>
