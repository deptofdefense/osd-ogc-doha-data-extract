<P>Forty-six-year-old machine operator had a history of failing to meet his financial obligations.  Although he has paid most of his bad debts off, he remains deeply 
in debt as a result of a judgment, and his monthly payments are not sufficient to pay off the accumulating interest.  Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and 
material facts about financial condition on his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 11 March 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-32946.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-32946.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
29 April 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 13 August 2003.  The case was originally 
scheduled to be heard on 18 September 2003, but as the U.S. Government was closed on that date due to Hurricane Isabel, the hearing was rescheduled with 
Applicant's consent.  On 30 September 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 7 October 2003.  I kept the record open so that Applicant could 
submit three additional exhibits that were admitted without objection from department counsel.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 46 years old.  He is a skilled machine operator who is assigned jobs out of his union hall.  One of the companies for whom he has worked wishes to 
employ him in a position that requires a security clearance.  Tr. 15-17.  He is married and lives with his wife and one of his three children.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's financial problems began when he was self-employed as a general contractor.  In 1996, Applicant purchased a four-wheel drive backhoe, an end-loader, a dump truck, and a trailer for his business.  Within a year, he was unable to make the payments on the $43,000 loan as he was unable to sustain his 
business.  Sometime thereafter, possibly 1998, the equipment was repossessed and sold.  Tr. 20-22.  In 1999, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant 
for over $18,000.  Tr. 22.  Applicant pays $125 a month, at over 11 percent interest, to satisfy the judgment.  Tr. 22.  He has not always been able to make the 
payments.  His current debt is over $25,000.  Ex. B.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his wife have settled the delinquent accounts to two department stores and the dentist.  Applicant's home state filed a tax lien against Applicant 
in 1999 for non-payment of a state tax debt of $242.  The lien was released in December 1999.  Exs. A, C, D.  In June 2002, Applicant settled a delinquent debt 
for medical services of over $600 after the provider of those services filed a civil action against him.  In 2001, Applicant owed a timber tax of approximately 
$1,500.  The tax was collected by intercepting Applicant's federal tax refund.</P> 
 
<P>On 23 April 2002, Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) and certified that his statements on the form were true, complete, and correct 
to the best of his knowledge and belief.  Applicant answered "no" to the following questions on the SCA:</P> 
 
<P>36. In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?</P> 
 
<P>37. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?</P> 
 
<P>38. In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?</P> 
 
<P>39. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had an unpaid judgment for over $18,000 (&para; 1.a.), had two debts that were referred for collection (&para;&para; 1.b., 1.c.), had a 
debt charged off (&para; 1.d.), had a state tax lien against him (&para; 1.e.), and his monthly income does not permit him to repay his delinquent debts (&para;1.f.).  An 
applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has paid off all of his delinquent accounts except for the judgment that resulted from his failure to pay his loan to purchase the equipment for his 
business.  As these debts no longer represent a security concern, finding is for Applicant on &para;&para; 1.b. - 1.d.November 5, 2003</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is paying off his judgment at the rate of $125 a month.  But, because of the interest rate and amount of the judgment, Applicant is not making any 
progress.  His debt of over $18,000 has ballooned to over $25,000.  At an interest rate of over 11 percent, Applicant will never pay down the principle until he 
pays substantially more than $125 a month.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  DC E2.A6.1.2.1.  He is unable to satisfy this debt.  
DC E2.A6.1.2.3.  Although Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors (<EM>see</EM> MC E2.A6.1.3.6), at the current rate, he will never be able to 
satisfy the judgment against him.  Finding is against Applicant on &para; 1.a. and 1.e.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberate falsified his answer to questions 36 (&para; 2.a.), 37 (&para; 2.b.), and 38 and 39 (&para; 2.c.) on his SCA.  Under Guideline E, 
conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.</P> 
 
<P>The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish by substantial evidence that Applicant answered questions 36, 37, 38, and 39<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of his SCA 
incorrectly.  The deliberate falsification of relevant and material facts from a security clearance application is a disqualifying condition.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Thus, 
the issue is whether Applicant deliberately answered those questions incorrectly.  Applicant contends that he did not handle the household finances, was 
unaware of the debts, and was mistaken concerning the unpaid judgment because he thought it occurred more than seven years prior to his completion of the 
SCA.  I do not find Applicant's excuses persuasive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Question 36 asks about tax liens in the previous seven years. It is difficult to believe Applicant was not aware of the 1999 tax lien because he was not 
handling the household finances.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2)  Question 37 asks if Applicant had an unpaid judgment in the past seven years.  Applicant has not paid this debt to date, and surely knew the judgment was 
still outstanding on the date he completed his SCA.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Applicant was also well aware that he was over 180 days delinquent on debts in the past seven years and was currently over 90 days delinquent on some of 
the debts.  Under the circumstances, none of the mitigating factors listed under the guideline apply.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.  Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P>
