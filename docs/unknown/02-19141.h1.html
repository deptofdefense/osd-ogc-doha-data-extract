<P>Applicant's financial irresponsibility makes him unsuitable for a security clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 4 December 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of his clearance because of financial considerations.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 19 January and 25 March 2004 and requested a decision without hearing. 
He did not respond to DOHA's 17 May 2004 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 25 June 2004, the day the response was due. DOHA 
assigned the case to me 19 July 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted being unwilling or unable to pay the three debts alleged in the SOR. He is unable to pay the $7,200.00 debt at 1.a. He is unwilling to pay the 
smaller debts at 1.b. and 1.c. because of their age.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He is a nearly 51-year-old truck driver for a defense contractor. He has never applied for a clearance before.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties and irresponsibility. An August 2001 credit report reflected three bad debt/charge off accounts, three slow pay 
accounts, and one 30-day past due account.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The report also showed that he previously had eight past due accounts, varying from 30-days past due to 120-days 
past due. A May 2003 credit report showed the same three bad debt/ charge off accounts (one now settled), plus a new bad debt/charge off account.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> One of the 
earlier slow pay accounts was back to being 120-days past due. An April 2004 credit report showed the new  bad debt/charge off account plus a new collection 
account for $2,700.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant says little about how his finances came to be in such disarray, except to state that the $7,200.00 debt alleged in the SOR is for a car note he co-signed 
for his daughter. The car was repossessed when she could not make the payments. In September 2001, he was briefly in a debt  repayment program to address 
three past due accounts (including one to the IRS) totaling almost $11,500.00. He quit the program when he concluded that he could better address those three 
debts on his own, and the credit reports suggest he eventually resolved those debts.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant has not otherwise documented his financial misadventures.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and 
circumstances presented. Each adjudicative decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDENS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A clearance decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government 
must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against 
access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person with access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect 
national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-19141.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a Guideline F case and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although his total debt is not large, it forms part of an 
ongoing pattern of slow pay/no pay that appears to have plagued him for some time. He either cannot or will not pay the three debts alleged, and while he 
claims that two of the debts are old, he does not claim that he paid these accounts or was otherwise relieved of his obligation to pay. As he is taking no action to 
resolve these debts, he cannot be considered a suitable candidate for a clearance. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
