<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Forty-eight year old Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1978, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and resides in the U.S. with his native-born U.S. citizen wife 
and three native-born U.S. citizen children.  His father and siblings are Syrian citizens residing in Syria (his father is a Syrian citizen--with a U.S. "green 
card'--residing primarily in the U.S.).  Syria is a State sponsor of terrorism.  Nevertheless, there has been no effort to intimidate his family to influence his 
actions.  The citizenship and residency status of his family members, who are not agents of a foreign government and not in positions to be exploited by a 
foreign government, do not constitute a security risk.  The government's security concerns have been mitigated.  Clearance is granted.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On April 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written statement, dated April 25, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  Department Counsel indicated the 
government was ready to proceed, and the case was assigned to me, on October 28, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued that same date.  The hearing was held 
before me on November 15, 2005.  During the hearing, two Government exhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and Applicant's testimony were received.  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on November 28, 2005.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>At the commencement of the government case, Department Counsel requested Official Notice be taken of the contents of the following documents: U. S. 
Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights: Syria - 2004, dated February 28, 2005; U. S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular 
Affairs,Consular Information Sheet: Syria, dated August 31, 2005; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Background Note: Syria, dated 
October 2005; The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Syria: Political Conditions and Relations with the United 
States After the Iraq War, dated January 10, 2005; and Executive Order 13338, Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain 
Goods to Syria, dated May 11, 2004.  Pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.), I took Official Notice as requested, without any objection by 
Applicant.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a secret security clearance.  He was originally granted an interim secret 
security clearance about two years ago, but the current status of that clearance is not known.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in 1957 in the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), a country now included on the U.S. Department of State's list of State sponsors of terrorism,<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> 
(3)</SUP></A>and whose interests may be inimical to the United States.  It is an "authoritarian regime with virtually absolute authority in the hands of the President,"<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 
has been under martial law since 1963.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Syria's human rights record is poor.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Syria permits a number of terrorist groups within its borders to openly oppose 
U.S. policies in the Middle East, and American citizens traveling in the country are cautioned to remain vigilant because U.S. interests and citizens might be 
targeted.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On May 11, 2004, President Bush signed Executive Order 13338, Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods to Syria, 
implementing sanctions, in accordance with the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, prohibiting the export to Syria of U.S. 
products other than food or medicine.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The U.S. Government recalled its Ambassador to Syria in February 2005, and as of October 2005, the Ambassador had 
not returned.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>During 1957-1978, while residing with his family, including three sisters and three brothers, Applicant exercised the rights and privileges of a citizen of Syria. 
In March 1978, he moved to the United States.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He enrolled at a U.S. university in September 1978, and eventually, in June 1996, was awarded a BSCE 
degree.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In December 1981, he married his first wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, and in June 1985, they were divorced.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He married his second and current 
wife, another native-born U.S. citizen, in November 1992.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  They have three native-born children, and reside in the U.S.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>After residing in the United States for about seven years, in June 1985, Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  At the time he took his 
oath of allegiance and was granted his new citizenship, Applicant renounced any allegiance to a foreign prince.  Nevertheless, Applicant considers himself to be 
a dual citizen of Syria.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  He had been issued a Syrian passport prior to becoming a U.S. citizen, but allowed it to expire and never considered having it 
renewed.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  He possesses a valid U.S. passport.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Considering himself a model U.S. citizen, Applicant contributes to his nation, state, and local governments.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  He has served jury duty, votes in all elections, 
and is active socially and civically in his community.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  He and his wife own a residence and a vacation property in the U.S., and do not own any property 
outside the U.S.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother is deceased.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He considers himself close to the remaining members of his immediate family, his father, sisters, and brothers, all of whom 
are citizens of Syria and still reside there.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  His father, born in 1933,<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> was in wholesale produce, but is now retired, and resides part of the year in Syria,<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> 
and a greater part of the year in the U.S. with Applicant.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  He possesses a "green card,"<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> and hopes to learn enough English to enable him to become a 
naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's oldest brother, born in 1965,<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> is married, with five children.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  His wife is a homemaker.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  This brother owns a company, with 20-25

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>[GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE]:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security" standard<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard.  For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, 
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. 
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  This 
situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In support of its contentions, the government has cited the facts that Applicant's father and six siblings are citizens of Syria.  In the case of the siblings, they are 
both citizens and residents of Syria.  His father is a part-time resident of Syria, when not residing in the U.S.  Those simple facts, standing alone, are sufficient 
to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, the mere possession of family ties 
with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.<A HREF="04-06386.h1.html#N_62_"><SUP> (62)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties may pose a security risk. 
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>None of Applicant's immediate family members are associated with the Syrian government or any intelligence services or organizations.  His brothers and 
brothers-in-law are all employed in private non-governmental businesses or enterprises, and his sisters and sisters-in-law are either full-time homemakers or 
divorced and unemployed.  These facts, when considered in light of the nature of the government in Syria--an authoritarian regime which seemingly supports 
and apparently provides safe haven for terrorist groups, and whose interests may be inimical to the United States--renders an analysis involving the adjudicative 
guidelines and the various applicable conditions set forth therein more difficult.  His family members keep a generally low profile in Syria and are not 
politically active.  In nearly 50 years, the Syrian government has never indicated any interest in their activities or in their relationship with Applicant.  If past 
experience is significant in forecasting future conduct, it appears the Syrian government is disinterested in Applicant and his family.<BR> 
<BR>

<P>The residence and citizenship of Applicant's immediate family members are clearly a security concern under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 
E2.A2.1.2.1. (an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country), but the significance of that condition in this instance is mitigated by the application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) 
E2.A2.1.3.1. (a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States). Applicant's contact with his family varies.  It is clear his contacts with his father, and to a certain extent, his 
brothers, are frequent and planned, thus negating the applicability of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent), but the same cannot be said for his relationship with his sisters.  With respect to them, I find FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. is applicable.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's interests in the U.S. are substantial.  His wife and three children are native-born U.S. citizens, residing in the U.S.  Applicant owns no property 
overseas, but does own two properties in the U.S.  His bank accounts and retirement accounts are in the U.S.  These facts fall within FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. 
(foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based on the evidence, I conclude the security concerns manifested by the government, in this instance, are largely unfounded.  Notwithstanding the nature of 
the government in Syria, I find that Applicant's immediate family, considering their citizenship and residency status, do not constitute an unacceptable security 
risk.  Their continuing personal relationship is viewed in positive terms, having no security significance.  Thus,  in light of the evidence presented, I conclude 
Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case under Guideline B.  Accordingly, 
allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.<BR>

<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  Clearance is granted.<BR>
