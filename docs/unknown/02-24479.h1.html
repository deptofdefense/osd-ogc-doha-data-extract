<P>Although Applicant's financial difficulties were largely due to circumstances beyond his control, they were not mitigated where Applicant had not begun any 
repayment on nine delinquent accounts totaling nearly $15,000.00, notwithstanding that creditors had not responded to Applicant's July 2002 request for 
repayment plans. Applicant's favorable character references were insufficient to overcome adverse security inference of his indebtedness. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 8 October 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-24479.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 12 
November 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to a different Administrative Judge but was re-assigned to me on 8 January 2003 because of case load considerations, and received by me the same day. On 15 January 2003 I scheduled the case for hearing 
and I issued a Notice of Hearing on 17 January 2002 for a hearing on 7 February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses;  Applicant presented one exhibit--admitted without 
objection--and his testimony. DOHA received the transcript on 20 February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations of the SOR except for subparagraphs 1. e. and g., concerning debts which he asserted he paid 30 July 2002;<A HREF="02-24479.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> accordingly, I 
incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has been employed by his current employer since 
August 1999. Applicant is a computer network technician, employed in direct support of government agencies, including the U.S. Navy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges--and the government's evidence documents--Applicant's nine delinquent credit accounts totaling approximately $15,000.00, and falling 
delinquent between approximately 1997 and 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributed his past due accounts to a variety of factors: losing his job in early 1994, followed by sporadic employment until obtaining his current 
position in August 1999; an unsuccessful business venture in mid-1994, when he used credit cards to acquire inventory for his computer business; an 
automobile repossession due in part to his being swindled by a used car reseller; and the birth of a child in August 1994 (Applicant already had a step-child, 
born in 1990). Applicant acknowledged a large number of delinquent debts in his sworn statement in June 2000  (G.E. 2). In response to government 
interrogatories (G.E. 3), and as a show of good faith, Applicant made approximately $2,200.00 in payments to eight creditors (including the creditors alleged at 
1.e. and g.); he sent letters to the other 10 creditors alleged in the SOR (including the debt at 1.l. that I conclude is not Applicant's) attempting to make payment 
arrangements with each creditor. None responded. Applicant has not made any payments to any of the nine delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. Although he 
intends to repay these creditors, the security of his family comes first, and he is currently saving his pay in case he does not obtain his clearance and loses his 
job (Tr. 54).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's Answer and A.E. A contain an impressive array of character references and job commendations, praising the quality of his work and his honesty 
and integrity on the job. The military references--including a RADM (O-8)--specifically express no concerns over granting Applicant's clearance, although 
none appear to be aware of his financial problems. I found Applicant to be an honest and straightforward witness. His monthly positive cash flow is 
approximately $400.00 (Tr. 50). He essentially pleads for the opportunity to continue his employment in order to begin repaying his past due creditors (Tr. 53).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn. . .).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and his current non-payment on 
the delinquent accounts. While circumstances beyond his control contributed to the original indebtedness, the past due amount on the nine accounts is nearly 
$15.000.00. The fact that the creditors have not responded to Applicant's request to enter into repayment plans, does not absolve Applicant of his responsibility 
to resolve these debts one way or the other.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations, except that the indebtedness was due to circumstances beyond his control. While 
Applicant appears to have stopped digging himself into a financial hole, he has not started to pull himself out of it, except for the good-faith payments made in 
response to the interrogatories. His remaining indebtedness is too large and his repayment plan too little evolved to conclude that Applicant's financial 
problems are behind him.  I resolve Guideline F. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>G.E. 4, Applicant's response to interrogatories, documented that Applicant paid these two accounts before issuance of the SOR. Although Applicant admitted 
the debt at subparagraph 1.l., the record evidence (A.E. A) tends to confirm Applicant's testimony that his account appeared on his CBR in error (Tr. 49-50).
