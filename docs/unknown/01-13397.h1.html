<P>The Applicant's intentional falsifications on his security clearance application and during his interview with a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service 
have not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On July 30, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 30, 2002, notarized on October 2, 2002, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on November 26, 2002.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on December 10, 2002, scheduling the hearing for 
January 29, 2003.  At the hearing the Government presented eight exhibits and called one witness.  The Applicant presented nine exhibits and testified on his 
own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on February 13, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 39 years old, he has a high school diploma and some college.  He is employed as a Computer Operations Analyst for a defense contractor.  He 
is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated July 17, 2002 that was electronically transmitted.  In response to question 
24, which asked, "Have you ever been charged with or convicted or any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs ?"  The Applicant answered "No".  (<EM>See</EM>, 
Government Exhibit 1).  This was not a truthful statement.  The truth is that the Applicant was arrested on December 10, 1995, and charged with (1) Driving 
Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or drugs, (2) Driving while .08% or More blood alcohol content.  The charges were reduced, and the Applicant was found 
guilty of Reckless Driving on Highway, with a finding by the court that alcohol and/or drugs were involved.  The Applicant was also arrested on October 31, 
1997, and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drug, and (2) Possession of Less than one ounce of Marijuana in vehicle.  The 
charges were reduced, and the Applicant was found guilty of Wet Reckless Driving/No Injury.  </SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant testified that this was the first time he had ever used an electronic form when updating his security information on his security clearance 
application and he experienced many problems.  He stated that the entire process was extremely poor and confusing.  It was never fully explained what the new 
process was, nor was he given any instructions on the new process of reporting.  He stated that a global e-mail was sent to everyone in the department 
instructing them to fill out security documents by a certain date.  Upon reflection, the Applicant believes that he did not give the time to each section that it 
warranted and he did not read every question before answering it.  He further stated that the new format for reporting information did not save data correctly, he 
had to re-input data that he had previously entered, possibly overlooking areas that were missed, the process did not allow him to review and sign the document 
before sending it, and there was no privacy in which to fill out the forms.  His department was required to use a common PC for the whole group, which sits in 
the middle of the work area.  </P> 
<P>As a result, the Applicant contends that nothing was done deliberately.  He states that he did not deliberately omit any information.  He realizes that he should 
have paid more attention to what he was doing.  He states that he just filled out the form wrong and made a terrible mistake.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When questioned as to whether he knew he was filling out a security clearance application when he was inputting  information on the computer, the Applicant 
initially indicated that he was not sure what he was filling out.  The Applicant later testified that when he was inputting the information on the computer, he 
referred to a copy of his old security clearance application for addresses and other information.  He also admitted that the entire process took time, was not a 
slam dunk and occurred over a two week period.  (Tr. pp. 117-118).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same security clearance application, at question 30, asked him "In the last seven years has your use of alcoholic beverages resulted in alcohol related 
treatment or counseling?"  The Applicant responded "NO".  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he received alcohol education 
counseling for three to four months in 1996, and that he has attended both court ordered and voluntary Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  The Applicant 
explained that he did not disclose his attendance at Alcohol Anonymous because he did not think that information was traceable and he believed it to be 
anonymous.  (Tr. p. 98).    </SPAN></P> 
<P>During an interview with a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on March 8, 2001, the Applicant was asked to explain his unlisted alcohol 
arrest in October 1997.  He was then asked if he had any other Driving Under the Influence arrests.  The Special Agent who conducted the interview of the 
Applicant testified that the Applicant initially responded "No".  He later recanted and admitted an arrest in 1989 or 1990, but gave false and misleading 
information concerning the arrest.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibits 7 and 8).  The Applicant also stated that he had not been driving the vehicle at the time, but that 
he had a designated male driver.  This information again, was not true.  The Applicant simply lied.  The police report of the incident indicates that the arrest 
actually took place on December 10, 1995, and that he had been stopped for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol while driving his vehicle.  (<EM>See</EM>, 
Government Exhibit 5). </P> 
<P>During the same interview with the same Special Agent from DSS the Applicant was asked if he had any drug related arrests to which he replied "NO".  This 
was a false answer.  The Applicant had in fact been charged with a drug related offense during his arrest on October 31, 1997, after marijuana had been 
recovered from his pants pocket.  The Applicant explained that he did not tell the Special Agent about the marijuana  that was found in his pants because it was 
not his, and the charge had been dropped.  (Tr. pp. 108-109).</P> 
<P>    <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he violated Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 1001, a felony by  falsifying his security clearance application of July 17, 2000, and by providing false information to a DSS Special Agent on 
arch 8, 2001, during his background investigation.  The facts are set forth under paragraph 1, above. </SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or statute, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  any criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.   Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant intentionally falsified material facts in his security clearance application and 
during an interview with  a Special Agent from DSS (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of 
the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Admittedly, the electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire has created problems for some people who are not familiar with the process.  However, in this 
case, the Applicant has blamed the electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire for his own attempt to conceal material information from the Government.  This 
blame is not justified. The Applicant has not been frank and truthful with the Government concerning answers to questions about his arrests in December 1995 
and October 1997.  I have heard the Applicant's excuses for not providing truthful information to the Government on his application, and to the Special Agent 
during his background interview, and I do not find them credible.   </P> 
<P>With respect to his 1995 arrest, the Applicant has provided several versions of the facts.  He provided different information to the Special Agent during his 
background interview from that information that is contained in the police records of the incident.  Furthermore, his testimony at the hearing did not conform 
with the information contained in the police records.  Under the circumstances I have no choice other than to find against the Applicant concerning his attempt 
to conceal information from the Government during his interview with DSS.  </P> 
<P>Concerning his 1997 arrest, I also find that the Applicant intentionally omitted the Driving Under the Influence and marijuana charges from his security 
clearance application with the intent to deceive the Government.  The fact that the marijuana was not his, and the charge was ultimately dismissed, has no 
bearing on whether he should reveal it to the Government.  Furthermore, the Applicant was given adequate time to complete the application, over a period of 
two weeks.  If he did not spend the time on it that he should have, only he is to blame.</P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant 
has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal background.  This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and 
does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement 
of Reasons.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
