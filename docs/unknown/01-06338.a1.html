<P>Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr. issued a decision, dated May 16, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether Applicant can augment the record with evidence supportive of his case.  For the reasons set forth below, the 
Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 17, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline 
C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he stated, "I wish to have a decision without 
a hearing."  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared, and a copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant.  After Applicant's response to the FORM 
was received, the case was assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated May 16, 2002, in 
which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on 
Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See </EM>DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant states the following, "I wish to have the opportunity to prove in front of the Appeal Board [t]hat I am no longer a [citizen of a foreign 
country, hereinafter referred to as 'FC'], I do not have any financial interests in [FC]."</P> 
<P>The Board construes Applicant's appeal submission as a request to augment the record with evidence that he is no longer a citizen of FC and no longer has 
property interests there.  Even if Applicant had submitted such evidence, the Board could not consider it as it is prohibited from considering new evidence on 
appeal. Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Therefore, the Board cannot allow Applicant the opportunity to present new evidence on 
appeal.</P> 
<P>Applicant does not argue on appeal that the Administrative Judge committed any error.  There is no presumption of error below.  The Administrative Judge's 
unchallenged findings of fact provide a rational basis for his adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility and his adverse security clearance 
decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion </STRONG>   </CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
