  Applicant's argument that the Judge did not consider all the evidence is not persuasive.  The Administrative Judge articulated a rational basis for her conclusion that Applicant's circumstances including the political and intelligence profiles of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, increased Applicant's  vulnerability to foreign influence.  Similarly, given the record evidence, the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline E and J are also sustainable.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 15, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and 
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.   On March 
31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant 
to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision under Guidelines B, E, and J is 
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.<A HREF="04-02058.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge failed to consider all the evidence and erred in 
not applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="04-02058.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that his family member in Hong Kong is not an agent of a 
foreign power and not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in any way.  He also argues that when the circumstances presented in each subparagraph 
of the SOR, such as his foreign travel, are considered separately, they present no security concern.  The Board does not find these arguments persuasive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) Applicant was born in Taiwan, received his high school education there, and served mandatory 
military duty in the Taiwanese army; (2) Applicant was a member of a political party in Taiwan until 1981, when he became a U.S. citizen; (3) Applicant's 
brother has resided in Hong Kong and Shanghai since 1991 or 1992; (4) Applicant has monthly e-mail and telephonic contact with this brother; (5) Applicant 
traveled to Taiwan in 1991, 1998, and two times in 2000; (6) Applicant traveled to Hong Kong in 1998; (6) Taiwan is an active collector of competitive 
information and a perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S. companies producing military critical technologies; (7) Hong Kong is a special administrative 
region of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a totalitarian state rule by the Chinese Communist Party; and (8) the PRC is an active collector of competitive 
information and a perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S. companies producing militarily critical technologies.  Given those findings, the Judge 
concluded that Applicant's ties with those immediate family members raised security concerns under Guideline B and that Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="04-02058.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and 6<A HREF="04-02058.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
applied.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  If there are admitted or proven facts and circumstances that raise security concerns, 
"[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by 
Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge has to weigh the evidence 
as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing 
of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had the burden of demonstrating that his family member was not in a position where he is likely to be exploited by a foreign power.  Applicant's 
arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his 
burden of establishing that his relative was not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to his 
relative and the United States.  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo.</EM> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having relatives, cohabitants or associates who are connected with a foreign government is a disqualifying condition under Guideline B.<A HREF="04-02058.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  However, the 
absence of such a connection with a foreign government does not mean that there is no security concern under Guideline B.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-29665 
at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 10, 2004).  A reading of Guideline B in its entirety shows that security concerns can be raised by a variety of foreign connections, not just 
having family members with foreign government connections.  Additionally, the absence of a particular disqualifying condition does not compel a favorable 
security clearance decision.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-08052 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2003).  In her decision, the Administrative Judge articulated a rational 
basis for her conclusion that Applicant's circumstances, including the PRC's and Taiwan's political and intelligence profile, increased Applicant's vulnerability 
to foreign influence.  The Judge was not required to engage in a piecemeal analysis of each subparagraph of the SOR out of context from the security concerns 
presented by Applicant's circumstances as a whole.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1 is 
sustainable, and her overall unfavorable security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guidelines E and J should be reversed because the Applicant did not 
deliberately or intentionally make false statements in an interview with a government investigator.   Alternatively, Applicant argues that the Judge should have 
concluded that the security concerns raised under Guidelines E and J had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because the disqualifying conduct was an isolated 
incident, and the Applicant subsequently provided correct information.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statements about his intent and state of mind when he provided information to the government agent was relevant evidence, but they were not 
binding on the Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider 
Applicant's statements in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to provide false information did not preclude the Judge 
from weighing the record evidence and making  findings that contradicted Applicant's denials.  The security concerns raised by Applicant's falsification were 
not necessarily mitigated by Applicant's subsequent disclosures to the government.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).  Similarly, 
such concerns were not necessarily mitigated by the fact that the falsification was an isolated incident.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g</EM>., ISCR Case No. 04-00789 (App. Bd. June 28, 
2006).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is not arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
