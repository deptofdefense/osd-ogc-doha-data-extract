<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On October 15, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 14, 1996, and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was reassigned to this Administrative
Judge on December 30, 1996 after having been previously assigned to another Administrative
Judge on December 2, 1996.  On February 21, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it was clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny,
or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of eleven exhibits
and no witnesses; Applicant relied on her own testimony and five exhibits.  A transcript of the
proceedings was received on March 4, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted, without explanation, the factual allegations set forth in the SOR,
except for the factual allegation set forth under subparagraphs 1.e., 1.j., 1.m., 1.n., 1.p., and 1.q.
which she has denied.  I have accepted Applicant's admissions and incorporate them as part of
my findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is 36 years old and has been employed by her current employer since June
1995.  She is seeking to retain the secret clearance which was granted to her in 1992.  A
preliminary  determination could not be made because of financial considerations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant first encountered financial problems in the mid-1980's.  Fiscal mismanagement
had caused her to fall behind in her monthly home mortgage payments.  On September 10,
1985--three days before a scheduled foreclosure on her house--she filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter 13.<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Under a court-ordered plan, Applicant's employer was required to withhold
$394.30 from her salary each month--for 38 months--for payment directly to the Trustee of the
Bankruptcy Court.  On December 21, 1988 after all payments to the Trustee had been made,
Applicant's Chapter 13 Petition was discharged.<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>                                                         </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In July 1989, Applicant was laid off by the employer for whom she had worked the
previous nine years.  She again fell behind in her mortgage payments.  In order to avoid
foreclosure on her home, she filed a second Chapter 13 petition on March 27, 1990.  This petition
was dismissed at Applicant's request on June 21, 1990.  She had succeeded in protecting her
home from foreclosure in 1985 and 1990, but she would eventually lose it to foreclosure at a later
date (Tr. 53).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	While Applicant was focusing on saving her home from foreclosure, she was neglecting
and/or falling behind in other obligations.  She owed money on her 1985 and 1986 federal
income taxes.<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  This obligation had ballooned to $18,220.00 by the time the SOR was issued. 
She had incurred--and still owes--$2492.00 on a credit card.  She had incurred--and still
owes--an indebtedness of $908.00 to her former employer.  A judgement for $1,115.00 was
entered against her in 1989 for unpaid medical bills.  Another judgement in the amount of
$2150.00 was entered against her in 1993 by County N for unpaid property taxes.  Nine smaller
obligations totaling $1287.25 had been incurred at various times during the past ten years, and
were delinquent when the SOR was issued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has experienced periods of unemployment, as well as periods of
underemployment during the past ten years.  She was unemployed from January to April of
1990, and from July 1992 to March 1993, she was working part-time for two different temporary
employment agencies at a rate of remuneration that was significantly less than she had earned
previously (Tr.  45-46).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When she was first interviewed by the DIS in October 1991, Applicant confidently
reported  that she was "getting back on (her) feet now."  She had paid back the money which her
parents had loaned her and was working part-time "until (she) can clean up all accounts" (Gov.
Exh 5).  Four and one-half years later, Applicant would sound the same optimism in another
signed, sworn statement to the DIS.  She had moved back in with her family to save on expenses,
and had met with a counseling service to set up a payment plan.  She stated that it was her
intention to pay all of her obligations, except those where she disputed the amount, or did not
know the origin of the debt. In the Personal Financial Statement (PFS) which is included with her
statement, she indicated a remainder of $725.00 each month after meeting other obligations
(Gov. Exh. 4).  In a statement to the DIS one month later (April 1996), Applicant sought to
appease the concerns raised by her unpaid traffic fines by promising to have them "paid within a
month" (Gov. Exh 3).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	At her administrative hearing, Applicant presented evidence that she had met with a
consumer counseling service and had worked out a payment plan--less than one month prior to
the hearing (Applicant's Exh. A).  She presented evidence that she had paid her traffic tickets the
morning of the hearing (Applicant Exh. E).  In addition to the traffic tickets, Applicant has paid
of a debt of $119.00 (Applicant's Exh. B) in the ten months since her last DIS interview, and she
claims that she had paid her father the $4,000.00 which she owed him (Tr. 75).<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  However, since
she had made these payments in cash, she did not have any evidence that the payments were
made.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion F)</CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>(1)       A history of not meeting financial obligations;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>None Applicable.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criterion F.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each
of the factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion F.  The evidence establishes
that Applicant has had serious financial problems for more than ten years.  Because of overspending
and fiscal mismanagement, she fell behind in making mortgage payments on her home in 1985. 
Through a court-ordered plan under Chapter 13, which required her employer to withhold a portion
of her salary each month--for 38 months--for payment to the Trustee of the bankruptcy court,
Applicant was able to temporarily resolve her financial obligations.  However, less than two years
after the first petition was discharged, she was again behind in her mortgage payments, and again
she resorted to Chapter 13.  Three months later, after she had saved her home from foreclosure, the
court dismissed her petition pursuant to her request.  However, Applicant subsequently fell behind
in her mortgage payments yet again and lost her home to foreclosure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Additional evidence of Applicant's inability or unwillingness to live within her means and
pay her financial obligations when they become due, is found in the other debts which are alleged
in the SOR--and admitted by Applicant in her answer.  Some of these obligations were incurred
more than ten years ago, and Applicant has done nothing to satisfy them until shortly before the
hearing.  Less than one month before the hearing, she finally sought the assistance of a credit
counseling service; and the day of the hearing, she finally paid the traffic tickets which she had
promised to pay ten months earlier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The periods of unemployment or underemployment identified by Applicant were not of
sufficient duration to explain or excuse her current situation.  She was only unemployed from
January to April of 1990.  And she has had almost four years to recover from the period of
underemployment between July 1992 to March 1993.  Any financial setback which may be attributed
to periods of less than full employment are more than offset by Applicant's personal circumstances. 
She is unencumbered by the financial obligations which typically descend on someone her age.  She
is currently earning a satisfactory income<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> and has been earning a more than adequate income for
most of the past fifteen years.<A HREF="96-0640.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  Although she is taking medication for high blood pressure, there is
no indication of extensive medical bills which have not been covered by insurance, and there is no
evidence that she has experienced a catastrophic loss of any kind during the relevant time period. 
She has never been married and does not have any dependents who look to her for support; she
currently lives with a relative and does not pay rent or have a mortgage payment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is credited with satisfying the terms of the court-ordered plan which was imposed
incident to the bankruptcy petition filed by her in 1985. She was able to pay off her creditors, rather
than having her debts discharged in bankruptcy.  Similarly, Applicant is credited with requesting
dismissal of the Chapter 13 petition which she filed in 1990.  Again, she did not abandon her
obligations by seeking a discharge from them through bankruptcy.  Subparagraph 1b. and 1.g. are
concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has presented little else in the way of mitigation.  What she has presented has been
too little, too late.  Although the Personal Financial Statement which she prepared in March 1996,
showed a monthly gross salary of $3086.00, and a monthly remainder of more than $700.00 after
meeting her current obligations, she had applied only $119.49 of that amount toward satisfying the
long overdue debts identified in the SOR until the date of the hearing.  While she is credited with
satisfying the debts identified in Subparagraphs 1.p. and 1.q. of the SOR, she did not make these
payments under circumstances where she can be credited with initiating a good-faith, all-inclusive
effort to satisfy her other overdue obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Less than a month before her hearing, Applicant finally sought assistance from a consumer
credit counseling service.  The plan which the counseling service has prepared for her is a voluntary
arrangement which has been in place for less than a month (Applicant's Exh. A).  Applicant has not 
been making payments under this plan for a sufficient period of time for this Administrative Judge
to conclude that her financial problems are being resolved.  As it currently stands, it is a plan and
a promise which is not substantially different from the confident assurances Applicant had
previously made in her three signed, sworn statements to the DIS.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant testified that since March 1996, she has paid her father $4000.00 which she owed
him.  However, this obligation was incurred more recently than the $2490.00 debt she owed to the
credit card company, or the $908.00 which she owed her former employer, and should have been
given a lower priority--for repayment--than the judgment against her by County N, or her
indebtedness to the IRS.  In October 1991, Applicant told the DIS that she had paid her father "all"
of the money she owned him, so the $4000.00 debt paid during 1996 was a more recent obligation
than her indebtedness to the IRS, County N, her former employer, or the credit card company.  While
loans from family members are binding and valid obligations, Applicant should not expect accolades
for financial responsibility because she has given the loan from her father higher priority--for
repayment--than the long-standing debts owed to other creditors.  Criterion F is concluded against
Applicant.</FONT></P>
