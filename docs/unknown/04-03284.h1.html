<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns regarding foreign influence arising out of his marriage in 2003 to a citizen of Lebanon who has relatives living there 
by holding a security clearance for 27 years without adverse information and showing clear knowledge of security requirements. Applicant has had relatives of 
his own in Lebanon since he first held a security clearance without any adverse consequences. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 24, 2005, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> 
</SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated May 13, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned 
to me on June 27, 2005, and a Notice of Hearing was issued August 10, 2005 for a hearing held on September 1, 2005. At the hearing, the Government 
introduced three exhibits and Applicant introduced eleven exhibits. All were accepted into evidence. The Government offered six official documents for 
administrative notice to be taken. The Applicant, his wife, and four other witnesses testified. The transcript was received on September 16, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the specific security concerns under Foreign Influence Guideline B with explanatory information provided for all. The admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional 
findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an information systems security specialist. He has held a security clearance for 27 years. 
He also held an SCI clearance for two years. He has never had a security violation or been criticized for any security lapse. </P> 
<P>Applicant's parents were Lebanese and emigrated to the U.S. before Applicant was born. He was divorced in 2001, and was re-married in 2003 to a citizen of 
Lebanon whom he met through a friend of his family. Both his family and hers are Greek Orthodox, a strong factor in their attraction to each other. After their 
introduction, they corresponded for six months through the internet, and then he made two trips to Lebanon, in 2002 and 2003, to meet her and her family. He 
advised his employer of each trip. His wife has traveled to Lebanon twice since their marriage. She was an accountant in Beirut when they met and had no 
connection with the military, the government, or political movements in Lebanon. Since coming to the U.S. she enrolled in school to become a teacher's 
assistant and is now employed as such in the public schools. She is looking forward to a career in that field. She is now eligible after three years in the U.S. to 
apply for permanent residency and intends to do so. </P> 
<P>Applicant has a maternal aunt and an uncle living in Lebanon. Both are elderly and live in a rural part of the country. Neither is now employed. He only met 
them once while visiting his fianc&eacute; in 2002. </P> 
<P>Applicant's wife's family run a small grocery and live above the store in a small hill town (Exh. K). She has two brothers and one sister living in Lebanon. Her 
older brother runs the store; the younger brother is in college; and the sister is housewife. None have government connections. </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded for his skills, dedication to his work, and good character (Exhibits B-H). He travels extensively to military sites to perform work 
for his employer. His supervisors and colleagues are very complimentary of his abilities and work ethic. His security officer testified concerning his exemplary 
security record at his company (TR. 38-40). He loves his work, and takes great pride in his career contributions to the defense community. </P> 
<P>The Government has established by official documents of which I have taken official notice that Lebanon has experienced political turbulence, internal dissent, 
and foreign occupation (Exh. III - VI). These are matters of serious concern regarding national security and they have been considered in the context of this 
case. However, changes in Lebanon are occurring almost daily and improvements have been recently noted in U.S. Government policy statements (Exh. H).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are 
not citizens of the United States</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information." 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1. Having  immediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a disqualifying security concern. 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Based on the evidence of record, including 
Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign influence. Having established such reasons, the 
Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts 
and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3.) Since Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens of Lebanon and his wife's 
contacts are not casual by definition those factors are not applicable here. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of his relatives pose a potential security threat or are in a position likely to be influenced by the Lebanese government. None work for that government or 
are involved in work that might create security issues for the U.S.(Exh. J). Any potential security concerns relating to future trips to Lebanon are minimal 
considering the professional manner with which he has handled his past travels. Applicant can be expected to take whatever steps are necessary to minimize 
risk. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis. Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has strong and deep ties to the U.S. over many years of service and work as a defense contractor. Applicant is an impressive person of skills and dedication to 
his work who has dealt effectively with security issues for almost a quarter of a century. There is no evidence to cause one to think his conduct would change 
now. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents a highly credible case that he would not be influenced by anything anyone might seek him to do any acts contrary to the best interests of the 
U.S. His record of employment, his career as a trusted employee of a defense contractor for over a quarter century, and his record while holding a security 
clearance effectively refutes any likelihood that he would now take any action that would jeopardize national security. He has had relatives in Lebanon since he 
was born and since he first obtained a security clearance. The only changed circumstance is that he is now married to someone from Lebanon who has not yet 
become a U.S. citizen, but intends to do so, and she has relatives living there. But that fact does not, in light of the available information, totally change his 
eligibility to continue to hold a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
