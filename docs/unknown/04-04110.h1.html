<P>Applicant was born in the U.S. to Colombian parents, and held dual citizenship for many years.  He fulfilled his military service commitment by attending the 
Colombian Naval Academy for one year.  He later renounced his Colombian citizenship and made the U.S. his permanent home. Applicant worked for defense 
contractors and held a security clearance for several years.  His parents are dual citizens of the U.S. and Columbia, and reside in Colombia part of each year.  
One of his sisters is a citizen of Colombia and a permanent resident of the U.S.  Applicant mitigated the security concerns relating to possible foreign influence 
and foreign preference.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 11, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (the "Directive").  On April 29, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security 
concerns raised under the Directive, specifically Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 11, 2005.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2005.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on October 13, 2005.  At 
the hearing, the government introduced Exhibits 1 through 10.  Applicant provided Exhibits A through J, and testified on his own behalf.  At Applicant's 
request, I kept the record open to allow the submission of additional documents.  Applicant subsequently provided five character statements which were 
admitted as Exhibits K through O, without objection.  DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 28, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations.  (Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated May 11, 2005, at 3-5.)  
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denied the factual allegation in &para; 1.b of the SOR.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  After a complete and thorough review 
of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is 37 years old.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  He is a Customer Relations Management Technical Lead for a defense contractor providing aerospace engineering 
services and materials to the United States government.  (<EM>Id.</EM> at 2; Tr. at 42.)</P> 
<P>Applicant parents were citizens of Columbia; his father was an officer in the Columbian Navy.  His parents lived in the United States for a period while his 
father attended a U.S. Navy post-graduate course.  Applicant was born in the U.S. in 1968.  (Ex. 2 at 1.)  Because of his birth in the U.S., Applicant is a U.S. 
citizen.  He was also entitled to Columbian citizenship because he was born to Columbian citizens.  Applicant and his family later returned to Columbia where 
he lived while growing up.  Applicant held dual citizenship for several years.  </P> 
<P>As a citizen of Columbia, Applicant was subject to the requirement for mandatory military service.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  To fulfill that requirement (and to avoid being 
drafted into the Army), he enrolled as a cadet in the Columbian Naval Academy between July 1988 and July 1989.  (Tr. at 29.)  The naval academy training was 
not provided free of charge; Applicant was required to pay for his education.  He never received a commission in the armed forces or military pay.  (Tr. at 29-30.)  Applicant hoped to attend the U.S. Naval Academy as an exchange student, and submitted applications several times.  (Tr. at 36-37).  However, he was not 
proficient enough in the English language at that time to qualify, and lacked a U.S. Congressional nomination.  (Tr. at 36-37.)  </P> 
<P>In 1989, Applicant came to the United States.  He attended college at a well-known university specializing in aeronautical engineering, and graduated in 1993 
with a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  Applicant applied to become a U.S. Navy pilot, but positions were not then available.  
(Tr. at 37-38.)</P> 
<P>Between 1994 and 1997, Applicant worked as a senior database engineer for a civilian corporation.  His duties included work on government contracts, 
including classified programs after 1996.  (Answer to SOR, dated May 11, 2005, at 1.)  He developed special expertise in simulators.  Between about 1997 and 
1998, Applicant served as a database engineer for a U.S. firm and worked on simulators in Italy for foreign military services.  (Ex. 2 at 3.)  In 1998, Applicant 
began working as a staff systems engineer for his present employer.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant applied for and was granted a security clearance in 2002.  (Ex. 1 at 9.)  During the application and investigation process, the issue of his dual 
citizenship arose.  (Ex. 3 at 1.)  Applicant later renounced his Colombian citizenship.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  </P> 
<P>During his years of service to defense contractors, Applicant has been deeply involved with numerous high-level, classified programs.  (Answer to SOR, <EM>supra</EM>, 
at 1-2.)  He has worked as a custodian for on-site classified facilities.  In July 2005, Applicant's employer presented him with a certificate of appreciation for 
his outstanding contributions to an important project for the Department of Defense.  (Ex. J.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant submitted several favorable character references.  Applicant's former supervisor describes him as an open, honest, and professional individual who 
maintains the highest ethical standards.  (Ex. M.)  A fellow employee, who has worked with Applicant since 1999, commends his judgment, honesty, and 
trustworthiness, and praises his proper handling of classified material.  (Ex. L.)  Another co-worker, who has known Applicant since 1998, says he is honest, 
trustworthy, conscientious, and professional.  (Ex. N.)  According to another co-worker who has known Applicant since 1994, he has always handled classified 
material in a professional and trustworthy manner.  (Ex. O.) </P> 
<P>At the time of the hearing, Applicant planned to be married within a few days.  (Tr. at 43.)  His wife is a U.S. citizen who works for the same defense 
contractor.  (Tr. at 44.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant's father completed the post-graduate course and obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering.  (Ex. 4.)  A U.S. aerospace agency sponsored 
the presentation of his thesis at an international symposium on space science and technology.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  He later attended a defense college in the U.S.  (Tr. at 32.)  
His father ultimately achieved the rank of Rear Admiral in the Columbian Navy.  (Ex. 4.)  Between about 1989 and 1991, Applicant's father was the 
Superintendent of the Columbian Naval Academy.  Among other honors, he had the distinction of hosting the U.S. President during an official visit to 
Columbia.  (Exs. B and C.)  He retired from active duty in 1991.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  After his retirement, he served as the Director of the Armed Forces Military Hospital.  
From 1996 to 1999, he was an advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations for Columbia on science and technology.  He also served as a member of the 
Columbian Naval Counsel, an informal advisory group made up of former admirals.  (Tr. at 25, 32.)  He discontinued working with that group between about 6 
or 10 years ago.  (Tr. at 26; Ex. A at 1.)</P> 
<P>Applicant's father also owns a business in Columbia.  (Ex. K; Tr. at 26.)  The agency supplies fruits, vegetables, and meats to cruise ships that visit Columbia 
in the summer.  (Tr. at 26; Ex. 5; Ex. K.)  At first, one of Applicant's sisters operated the business; now their Colombian business manager handles their affairs.  
(Ex. K).</P> 
<P>Applicant's parents became naturalized citizens of the United States in July 2001.  (Exs. D, E, G, and H.)  They own a home in the U.S. but rent it out. (Tr. at 
27.)  Their primary residence in the U.S. is with Applicant's sister.  (Tr. at 27.)  They also own a home in an exclusive, urban area in Columbia where they live 
for several months each year.  (Tr. at 26, 34.)  The home is on a island separated from the mainland by a military installation, so it is very secure.  (Tr. at 34.)  
Finally, they sometimes travel to Spain and the Netherlands Antilles to visit their other daughters.  (Tr. at 26.)  Applicant's father intends to sell his business 
and assets in Colombia and live permanently in the U.S.  (Ex. K).  His parents maintain dual citizenship, but always use their U.S. passports to travel.  (<EM>Id.</EM>; Tr. 
at 34-35.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant's oldest sister became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in March 1999.  (Ex. F.)  She lives permanently in the U.S.  (Ex. 1 at 15.)  </P> 
<P>His second sister is married to a German citizen.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  She maintains dual citizenship with Columbia and Germany, and lives permanently in Spain.  
(<EM>Id.</EM>; Ex. 1 at 5.)  </P> 
<P>His third sister is a citizen of Columbia, but resides permanently in the U.S.  She owned a florist shop in Colombia.  Police investigators learned that criminals 
listed her as a possible subject for kidnap and ransom, unfortunately a common offense in Columbia.  (Tr. at 27.)  Frequently, the criminals kidnap wealthy 
victims and transfer the captives to terrorist groups in exchange for payment, and the terrorist groups demand ransom from the families.  (Tr. at 27; Ex. 7 at 2; 
Ex. 8; Ex. 9.)  She applied for and was granted political asylum in the United States in August 2002.  (Ex. I.)  She resides permanently in the United States.  (Tr. 
at 40.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant's youngest sister is a citizen of Columbia.  (Ex. 1 at 6.)  Her husband is a U.S. citizen working as a representative for a U.S. firm.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  She 
was a part owner of the shipping agency (along with her father) but now resides permanently with her family in the Netherlands Antilles.  (Tr. at 39.)</P> 
<P>Applicant's brother was born in Germany but held Columbian citizenship.  (Ex. 1 at 4-5.)  He resides in the U.S.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  </P> 
<P>Columbia is a constitutional democracy.  (Ex. 8 at 1.)  The U.S. has long enjoyed favorable relations with Columbia.  (Ex. 6 at 9.)  The U.S. continues to 
provide substantial support to the Colombian government's counter-narcotics efforts, and encourages the government's efforts to strengthen its democratic 
institutions in order to promote security, stability, and prosperity in the region.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  The Colombian government faces several challenges, especially the 
activities of several political terrorist groups and large, well-organized narco-terrorist organizations.  (<EM>Id.</EM> at 3-4, 6.)  The U.S. State Department reports that, 
although serious problems remained, the Colombian government's respect for human rights has improved in some areas.  (Ex. 8 at 1.)  The threat of crime is 
significant in all parts of the country because of the activities of the political and drug-related terrorist groups in the country, but is somewhat less prevalent in 
most urban centers.  (Ex. 10.) </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(<EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988)).  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  (Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C, Foreign Preference:  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she 
may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  (Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.1.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> </EM>(<EM>Id.</EM>)  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  (<EM>Id.</EM>) <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.15.)  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be disqualifying if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties 
of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 defines "immediate family members" to include a 
spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant's parents are U.S. citizens, and live in Columbia for part of each year.  One of 
Applicant's sisters is a citizen of Columbia, although she resides permanently in the U.S.  The evidence raises this potentially disqualifying condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.3 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where an applicant has "[r]elatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign 
government."  Applicant's father is a retired Rear Admiral of the Columbian Navy; thus, this potentially disqualifying condition applies.  Paragraph 1.b of the 
SOR asserted that Applicant's father "is currently a member of the Columbian Naval Council."  In fact, Applicant's father served on this council for several 
years, but no longer serves in that capacity.  His father's former status as a Navy Council member does not raise this potentially disqualifying condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, these potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated under certain circumstances.  The Government produced substantial evidence 
establishing disqualifying conditions, thus Applicant had the burden to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.  (Directive, &para; 
E3.1.15.)  The government never has the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.  (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive provides that it is potentially mitigating where the "associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  
Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language, applicants must establish: (1) that the individuals in question are not "agents of a foreign power," and (2) that 
they are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United 
States.  (ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004)).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 438(6), the federal statute dealing with national security and access to classified information, the U.S. Congress adopted the definitions of the 
phrases "foreign power" and "agent of a foreign power" from 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(a) and (b).  50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) defines "agent of a foreign power"to include 
anyone who acts as an officer or employee of a foreign power in the United States, engages in international terrorism, or engages in clandestine intelligence 
activities in the U.S. contrary to the interests of the U.S. or involving a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States.  None of Applicant's relatives 
meet the definition of "agent of a foreign power" under 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board, however, has adopted a broader definition of the phrase "agent of a foreign power."  The Appeal Board has held that, "An employee of a 
foreign government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security duties to be an agent of a 
foreign power for purposes of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1."  (ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004); <EM>see also</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005) (employee of the Israeli government is an agent of a foreign power) and ISCR Case No.02-29143 at 3 
(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2005) (a member of a foreign military is an agent of a foreign power)).  Applying this broader definition, Applicant's father would be an 
"agent of a foreign power" because of his status as a retired military officer.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are "in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  The federal statute, 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(a), defines "foreign power" to include: a 
foreign government; a faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly acknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign government; a group 
engaged in international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or an entity directed and controlled by a foreign government.  The Appeal Board also 
construes the term "foreign power" broadly.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is also important to note at the outset that the mitigating condition in question focuses on whether a relative or associate of an applicant is in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in such a way as to have an applicant act adversely to the interests of the United States. It does not apply where a relative or 
associate may be vulnerable to criminal offenses or even acts of terrorism, unless they could cause an applicant to act against U.S. interests.  At times, the 
Appeal Board has placed great emphasis on evidence that a foreign power has engaged in intelligence gathering.  (ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 
22, 2005)).  However, there are a great many ways to gather intelligence information and the great majority of them do not involve exploitation of an 
applicant's relatives or associates overseas.  The mitigating condition in question is not focused on whether the foreign power collects intelligence information 
generally, rather it focuses whether a foreign power could exploit relatives and applicants in such a way as to cause an applicant to act adversely to the United 
States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM>In assessing whether an applicant is vulnerable to exploitation through relatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  
As noted above, &para;&para; E2.2.1, E2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the facts and circumstances, 
including the "whole person" concept, when evaluating each individual case.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual <EM>per se</EM> rule against granting 
clearances to any person with ties to persons in a foreign country, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An important factor for consideration is the character of any foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the government, 
within the relevant foreign country.  This factor is not determinative; it is merely one of many factors which must be considered.  Of course, nothing in 
Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  (<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 
00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2002)).  The Appeal Board repeatedly warns against "reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between 'friendly' nations and 
'hostile' nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B."  (ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002)).  It is well understood that "[t]he United 
States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have 
access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States."  (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 
(App. Bd. May 19, 2004)).  Distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with extreme caution.  Relations between nations can 
shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly.  Moreover, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they 
view as important to their vital interests or national security.  Finally, friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in 
economic, scientific, military, and technical fields.  (ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002)).  Nevertheless, the 
relationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt 
to exploit a resident or citizen to against the U.S. through the applicant.  The nature of the foreign government might also relate to the question of whether the 
foreign government or an entity it controls would risk jeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to force 
a U.S. citizen to betray this country.  The Appeal Board has specifically held that it is error for an administrative judge to fail to consider a hostile relationship 
between the U.S. and a foreign country.  (ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 4 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)).  The Appeal Board has held that "a country's poor human 
rights record and its differences with the United States on important security issues such as terrorism are factors" that a judge must consider.  (ISCR Case No. 
04-05317 at 5 (App. Bd. June 3, 2005)).  A friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to 
exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in that foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government of Columbia is a democracy, with a long history of good relations with the U.S.  That factor is not determinative, but suggests it is less likely 
that Columbia would attempt to exploit its residents or citizens to act adversely to the interests of the United States in the future.  On the other hand, there are 
"foreign powers" within Columbia whose interests are clearly adverse to those of the United States, including the narco-terrorists and several political terrorist 
groups.  These terrorists pose a threat to the personal safety of residents of Columbia.  The available evidence reveals a history of terrorist groups injuring or 
kidnaping residents for ransom; however, it does not show any history of foreign powers in Columbia exploiting citizens or residents in such a way as to cause 
or attempt to cause their relatives in the U.S. holding a security clearance to act adversely to U.S. interests.  This factor is not determinative, but tends to suggest 
that the specific risk addressed by this mitigating condition is minimal.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM>Another factor which must be considered is Applicant's relatives' vulnerability to exploitation by foreign powers in<STRONG> </STRONG>Columbia.<STRONG> </STRONG> Applicant's father is a retired 
admiral in the Columbian Navy, thus the government and its military forces have some influence on him.  At the same time, Applicant's parents are also 
citizens of the United States, and entitled to all the privileges and protections of U.S. citizens when they are outside Columbia.  This reduces their vulnerability 
to the government and military in Columbia.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are not especially vulnerable to terrorist groups in Columbia.  They reside in Columbia for only a portion of each year (about four to six 
months), reducing the possibility of their personal danger.  Furthermore, while in Columbia they live and work in an urban area that is safer than the rest of the 
country.  Particularly, their home is located on an island separated from the city by a military installation, thus assuring greater personal security.<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 of the Directive, it may also be mitigating where "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  It may be 
presumed that an applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to his family members, and Applicant has not presented evidence to refute this natural 
presumption.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in light of the "whole person" concept, keeping in mind that any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national security.  Applicant is a 
mature individual with an impressive history of service to this country, including years of work on projects while holding a security clearance.  Applicant has 
strong ties to this country.  He renounced his Colombian citizenship, even though it was not required.  His wife is a U.S. citizen who also works for the defense 
contractor.  His parents and one of his sisters are U.S. citizens with property interests in the U.S.  One of his sisters is a permanent resident of the U.S., although 
she is a Columbian citizen.  He has no financial interests in another country.  His standing within his professional community is with firms in the United States.  
Although his parents live in Columbia part of each year, under their unique circumstances the<STRONG> </STRONG>potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress by a 
foreign power is extremely low.  Because of Applicant's deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any 
conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the potential security concerns arising from his personal ties to relatives in 
Colombia.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C, Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A3.1.2.3 of the Directive, "military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country" may indicate a preference for a foreign country that 
could raise security concerns.  As noted above, Applicant held dual citizenship with the U.S. and Columbia.  His Columbian citizenship required him to serve 
in the military for one year; Applicant attended the Colombian Naval Academy as a cadet for one year to satisfy this obligation.  I note he never received pay or 
a commission.  Although his experience as a cadet did not require service in support of the military to the same extent as one on regular active duty, I conclude 
the available evidence is minimally sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be disqualifying where an applicant is "accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement or social welfare, from a foreign 
country."  (Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.2.4.)  In this case, Applicant is not currently accepting any such benefits.  Although he attended the Colombian Naval Academy 
many years ago, cadets were required to pay for their tuition-it was not a "benefit" as the term is used in the Directive.  I conclude this potentially disqualifying 
condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.3.1, provides that it may be mitigating where "dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country."  
Applicant was a U.S. citizen by reason of his birth in the U.S.  He was a citizen of Columbia because his parents were Colombian citizens then living in the 
U.S., therefore Applicant originally obtained his citizenship based solely on his parent's citizenship.  At the same time I note Applicant lived for several years in 
Columbia, and attended the Naval Academy, as discussed above.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating under &para; E2.A3.1.3.4 of the Directive where the applicant has "expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  In this case, 
Applicant renounced his Columbian citizenship.  He does not hold a Columbian passport and has no financial holdings in that country.  This potentially 
mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the circumstances in this case and the "whole person" concept.  Applicant's 
military service was in a limited capacity as a student, it was incurred to fulfill a compulsory service requirement, and it occurred many years ago.  Since then, 
Applicant left Columbia and made the U.S. his permanent home, he renounced his Columbian citizenship, and spent many years working to promote the 
interests of U.S. defense contractors and the U.S. Department of Defense.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any security concerns arising from his service as 
a Colombian Naval Academy cadet. </SPAN></P>
