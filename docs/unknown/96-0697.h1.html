  Applicant's November 1989 separation provided some explanation for her indebtedness, but did not explain her irresponsible handling of debts before November 1989, and  did not explain her irresponsible handling of debts after 1990--especially when she became  employed again in 1995. Applicant has twenty-three debts totaling $15,000.00: some she intends  to pay, but has made no effort to do so; others she intends to include in a bankruptcy filing she  has talked about for a year but done nothing. She has made no effort to contact her creditors and  make arrangements to satisfy those debts which are within her present financial means. During  two distinct periods in 1989-90 and late 1992, she falsified work records at her federal employer  to gain payment for time not worked, a clear breach of her fiduciary duty. Record evidence does  not establish sufficient extenuation, mitigation, or rehabilitation to sustain Applicant's eligibility  for clearance. Clearance denied.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On 23 September 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 24 October 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and
requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 5 December 1996; the record in this
case closed 14 February 1997, the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was originally
assigned to a different administrative judge, but was reassigned to me because of workload
considerations on 18 April 1997. I received the case on 18 April 1997 to determine whether
clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate those
admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 33-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks a secret clearance.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility. The SOR alleges 23 debts--totaling
over $15,000.00--falling past due between January 1989 and August 1995. Creditors obtained
judgments on ten of the debts (subparagraphs 1.b., c., g., i., j., k., l., q., r., s.); Applicant intends
to file bankruptcy on 12 debts (subparagraphs 1.a.-g., i., k., l., q., v.), but has not yet done so.
Applicant has made no payment on any of the bad debts, except for subparagraph 1.s.--when the
judgment creditor obtained a garnishment for approximately half the outstanding balance. Eight
of the debts are less than $100.00 each--not including statutory interest (subparagraph 1.g., h.,
k., l., v., w., x., y.); four others are less than $200.00 each (subparagraph 1.b., c., m., u.); one is
less than $250.00 (subparagraph 1. d).</P>

<P>	Applicant married her husband in August 1988. Her financial difficulties began in
January 1989, when her automobile was repossessed, leaving a deficiency of $6,000.00.<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
Applicant and her husband separated in November 1989. He is serving a prison sentence which
precludes his providing any child support for Applicant's two children. After the separation,
Applicant began to write bad checks to pay for bills and groceries, hoping to cover the checks
before the creditor submitted the checks a second time;<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> she was unsuccessful, and incurred
additional debt (returned check fees) on top of the original debts.  She switched banks several
times.</P>

<P>	On three occasions between late 1989 and May 1990, Applicant falsified time cards at her
employer--a Federal government agency.<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> Applicant was allowed to resign her position.
Applicant obtained employment as a time and attendance record keeper with another Federal
agency. Between October and December 1992, Applicant falsified her time records to reflect
fewer hours of leave taken. Her proposed removal was held in abeyance when Applicant
accepted a last chance offer--involving repayment for hours not worked--from the agency.
Applicant later resigned on her own.</P>

<P>	A Personal Financial Statement (PFS)(DIS Form 154) prepared 29 March 1996 shows
Applicant with a net monthly income of $69.00--after making payments to a credit counseling
firm of $120.00.<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> At the time she prepared this PFS, Applicant had not met with the credit
counseling firm; when she did, the firm drew up a payment schedule which would include
payments to all creditors, but which required a monthly payment of $325.00. Applicant claimed
to be unable to afford that payment. In April 1996, Applicant first stated an intent to file
bankruptcy on some of the debts, but could not afford the filing/attorney fees. In August 1996,
she repeated this intent, but still lacked the funds to file (Item 7). As of her answer--October
1996--she had still not filed for bankruptcy protection.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (CRITERION F)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts
to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable
criminal acts.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</P>

<P>		(2) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . check fraud. . . other
intentional breaches of trust;</P>

<P>		(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's
control (e.g, loss of employment. . . divorce).</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion F. The record evidence clearly
establishes Applicant's indebtedness and her irresponsible handling of that indebtedness. While the
Applicant's separation from her husband in 1989 provides some explanation for many of the debts,
those explanations do not justify her deliberate conduct in writing bad checks to cover household
expenses. Further the separation may serve to explain why many of Applicant's accounts became
delinquent in 1990 (1.e.-j.)--in the year after the separation--but it does not explain why accounts
became delinquent in 1989 before the separation (1. a.-d.), or continued to fall into delinquency after
1990. Applicant had debts become delinquent in 1991 (1.k.), 1992 (1.l., m.), 1993 (1.p.-r.), 1994 (s.-v.), and 1995 (w.-y.). The last seven debts in the SOR all involve bad checks, and with the exception
of 1. s. (involving checks written in 1992) all occurred in 1994 and 1995. Applicant's explanations
do not explain why Applicant has not made any efforts to satisfy any of these debts after obtaining
better employment in August 1995. Nearly a year has elapsed since Applicant's PFS suggested she
had $120.00 a month--$1,440.00 a year--available for debt reduction; that amount could have
satisfied the principal amount due on all thirteen debts of less than $250.00. Yet, the record contains
no evidence of any attempt by Applicant to satisfy these debts or communicate with the creditors in
any way. Further, if Applicant intended to file for bankruptcy on these debts, the $1,440.00 she had
available over the past year was more than enough to pay the filing fees. I conclude from Applicant's
inaction that she has no real intent to deal with her indebtedness, either by paying the debts or by
discharging them in bankruptcy.<A HREF="96-0697.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> I find criterion F. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion E. Applicant clearly breached her
fiduciary duty to the Government by falsifying her pay records--to her financial benefit--on several
occasions during two distinct periods of her recent past. Her personal problems during those periods
do not mitigate the fact that Applicant engaged in illegal acts to generate funds for her family. The
financial pressures that lead to that behavior have not abated, and the record contains no evidence
to suggest that Applicant would not engage in similar behavior if she perceived that her personal
circumstances warranted. I find criterion E. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant asserts that her husband was abusive and forced her to have this car repossessed. That circumstance,
standing alone, does not explain her failure to resolve the remaining indebtedness. The husband's unemployment
certainly affected Applicant's ability to pay on her accounts; the record is silent on the length of his unemployment prior
to their separation in November 1989.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>The methodology described by Applicant suggests that she knew the checks were worthless when she wrote
them and would be returned to the creditor as NSF (non-sufficient funds); Applicant hoped to make the checks good
by the time the creditor presented them for payment the second time.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Applicant had a variety of personal problems which caused her to use up her leave balances. In order to avoid
using up any more leave, Applicant's supervisors permitted her to make up hours lost during the regular work week
by coming to work on Saturday. Applicant came to work, took credit for working eight hours, but only worked two
hours or so. She did this to avoid having to pay a babysitter for the extra hours.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>The PFS also reports that Applicant spends $450.00 on groceries per month.
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>I am also concerned that while essentially ignoring her indebtedness, Applicant's budget includes $450.00
a month for groceries for a family of three plus $100.00 a month for meals out and $48.00 for school lunches; the budget
also includes $20.00 for lotto/bingo. Under Applicant's present financial situation, the magnitude of the grocery
expenses seems unreasonable; the lotto expenditure alone could have satisfied several of the smaller debts over the
course of a year.
