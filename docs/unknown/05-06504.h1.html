<P>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He recently filed for <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">bankruptcy,</SPAN> but thus far none of his debts has been discharged. Based on his current financial situation and his history of 
financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>March<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 15</SPAN>, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 28</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on </SPAN>May 4<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, and the 
hearing was held on </SPAN>May<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 23, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 7), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered three documentary exhibits, (Applicant 
Exhibits A through C), and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN>June 5<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 11 allegations, 1.a. through 1.k., 
under Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except 1.k. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I 
make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant explained that his debt for allegation 1.j. was as a result of his taking over the payment of a debt of his mother. His debt of $12,829, as alleged in 1.b, was because he did not need a 
vehicle that he had purchased, so he failed to make payments</SPAN> on it, and it <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was repossessed.  </SPAN>He could give no explanation for the reason that he did not attempt to sell the vehicle or resolve his 
payment in a responsible manner. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> gave no explanation as to why he had incurred the other overdue debts, and he failed to introduce any tangible evidence that in the future he would be

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. The evidence has shown that Applicant has taken no action to pay off these 
debts, and while<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has recently filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, there has been no evidence that the Bankruptcy Court will accept this bankruptcy filing or that any of the debts listed on the 
bankruptcy will be discharged</SPAN>.  Based on his tenuous financial situation and his history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his 
finances. I, therefore, resolve Guideline F against Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations 
and his current inability to satisfy his debts. I find that none of the Mitigating Conditions (MC)  apply. </SPAN></P>
