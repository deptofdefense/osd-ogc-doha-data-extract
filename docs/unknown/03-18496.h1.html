<P>Applicant has a long history of abusing alcohol. He was convicted of aggravated driving while under the influence of alcohol for offenses occurring in 1996 and 
2000. On one occasion he appeared at work smelling of alcohol. Despite alcohol treatment programs, Applicant relapsed on several occasions. Although he has 
been abstinent for 15 months, an insufficient period of time has elapsed to determine if Applicant has made the long-term commitment to sobriety necessary to 
mitigate the alcohol security concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 7 July 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-18496.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 30 July 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was 
assigned to another judge and reassigned to me on 10 March 2005. On 11 April 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 28 April 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old electrical engineer for a defense contractor. Ex. 1 at 1, 2. He has been married to his second wife for three years, and they are raising 
her three children. His supervisors and fellow employees consider him an intelligent, trustworthy, and dependable coworker.</P> 
<P>Applicant began consuming alcohol when he was 12 or 13 years old, by stealing it from his father's liquor supply. By the time he was in high school, he was 
drinking beer with his friends. They would wait outside liquor stores for someone who would be willing to buy them beer. By the end of high school, Applicant 
was able to consume as much as a 12-pack of beer on the weekends. By the time Applicant was 22 years old, he started drinking hard liquor more frequently. 
For many years, he drank a pint of bourbon and soda and several beers until he fell asleep. He continued this pattern until he was arrested for aggravated driving 
while intoxicated (ADWI)-driving with a blood alcohol level of .16% or greater-in early December 1996. Applicant had been drinking beer and hard liquor 
while driving, passed out, and came to on the opposite side of the highway. After his arrest, Applicant enrolled himself in a 28-day in-patient alcohol treatment 
program. Ex. 2 at 1-2; Answer. Applicant pled guilty to the offense and was sentenced to a fine and imprisonment for 90 days-both were suspended contingent 
upon his successful completion of the alcohol treatment program and his following the recommendations of the program. Ex. 7.</P> 
<P>Applicant was sober for 18 months after his arrest.  But he stopped going to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous<A HREF="03-18496.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (NA) and started drinking 
alcohol again. Within six months, he was drinking heavily again.</P> 
<P>In November 1999, Applicant started seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed him as having major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission and alcohol abuse 
and dependence, in remission. Ex. 4 at 1. The psychiatrist referred him to a licensed clinical social worker for treatment of his psychological problems. In 
January 2000, Applicant consumed alcohol while he drove between cities. He was stopped for speeding and arrested for DWI when the police officer 
discovered the alcoholic beverages in the vehicle. His blood alcohol level was .16% or greater. On 17 March 2001, Applicant pled guilty to ADWI and was 
sentenced to 364 days in jail (357 suspended) fined, and placed on unsupervised probation for 364 days. As terms of his probation, the court ordered several 
special conditions, including that he complete a "Drug Court Program" and not consume alcoholic beverages. Ex. 6 at 1-2. Applicant appears to have convinced 
the judge that since he was in counseling he did not need the "Drug Court Program." Despite the court order not to do so, Applicant started drinking within a 
month or six weeks. It began with a few beers on the weekends and "gradually turned into every day and then liquor with soda and beers during the week in the 
evening until [he] went to bed." Ex. 2 at 3.</P> 
<P>In July 2001, when he began to work for his current employer, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in which he revealed his alcohol-related arrests. In 2002, a co-worker reported to Applicant's supervisor that Applicant smelled of alcohol. The project manager counseled Applicant about 
coming to work smelling of alcohol. Tr. 21-23. Applicant continued to consume alcoholic beverages until January 2003. In May 2003, he completed a signed, 
sworn statement to a Defense Security Service agent detailing his problems with alcohol. Applicant relapsed and consumed alcohol between 24 December 2003 
and 1 January 2004.  Ex. 3 at 2. He has not consumed alcohol since then. The psychiatrist who has treated Applicant since 1999 and the licensed clinical social 
worker-psychotherapist who has been working with him for three years give him a favorable prognosis.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G--Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol at times to the point of intoxication from about 1976 until January 2004 (&para; 1.a), was diagnosed as 
being alcohol dependent in February 2004(&para; 1.b), was arrested in January 2000 and convicted of aggravated DWI (&para; 1.c), was diagnosed and treated for alcohol 
dependence from 1996-97 (&para; 1.d), and was arrested in December 1996 and convicted of DWI (&para; 1.e). Applicant admitted each of these allegations.  Excessive 
alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant had alcohol-related incidents away from work-his two ADWIs. DC E2.A7.1.2.1. He also had an alcohol-related incident at work-going to work smelling of alcohol. DC 
E2.A7.1.2.2. Applicant was diagnosed by a credentialed medical professional with alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. DC E2.A7.1.2.3. He engaged in 
habitual and binge consumption of alcohol by drinking several beers and a pint of bourbon daily for a number of years. DC E2.A7.1.2.5. He continued to 
consume alcohol subsequent to a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse by a medical professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program.  DC E2.A7.1.2.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, Applicant insists he has made positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety (MC E2.A7.1.3.3) and that he has abstained from 
alcohol for more than 12 months and has a favorable prognosis from a credentialed medical professional and a licensed clinical social worker.  MC 
E2.A7.1.3.4. There is no doubt Applicant is making substantial efforts to control his alcohol dependence and abuse. But this is not the first time Applicant has 
tried.  Even knowing the Government's concern about his drinking from answering the questions in his SCA, and while working with both a psychiatrist and a 
psychotherapist, Applicant was unable to abstain from drinking. Although he has been sober for 15 months, his record of treatment and relapse is long and 
continuing. Furthermore, I find unpersuasive Applicant's contention that the incident at his place of employment-smelling of alcohol-resulted from his having 
three or four beers the previous evening. After considering all of the circumstances of this case, and the adjudicative process factors (Directive &para; E2.2.1), I find 
against Applicant. With Applicant's history, abstinence for 15 months is not sufficient to convince me of Applicant's determination and ability to stay sober.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had two DWI convictions (&para;&para; 2.a-2.b). Applicant admitted the two convictions. A history or pattern of criminal activity 
creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
