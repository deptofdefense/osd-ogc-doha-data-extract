<P>Applicant's history of financial indebtedness partially caused by a recent divorce has been mitigated by a good faith effort to repay her creditors or otherwise 
resolve her financial indebtedness.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On June 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 26, 2004, in which she elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on October 28, 2004, consisting of six documents, 
referred to as Items 1 through 6.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant 
received the FORM on November 10, 2004, and she submitted a reply dated December 5, 2004.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on December 10, 2004. </P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 49 years old.  She is employed as a MRP Planner by a defense contractor and is applying for a security clearance in connection with her 
employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After six years of marriage the Applicant and her husband legally divorced in August 2002.  The divorce caused the Applicant serious financial difficulties.  At 
one point she was using her credit cards to purchase food and clothing.  In the summer of 2002, she consulted with a debt management counselor for financial 
guidance.  In order to eliminate her debt, she has taken out loans from her company savings program and has worked many hours of overtime.  Three of the 
twelve debts listed in the SOR are her ex-husband's responsibility, pursuant to the divorce decree.  In regard to the debts that she is responsible for, she has paid 
off all but two of them.  She is in the process of offering a settlement to the remaining creditors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence, namely the Applicant's credit report, supports each of the allegations in the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  The following 
debts were outstanding and owing by the Applicant as of May 19, 2004.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(a).  The Applicant is indebted to a bank in the approximate amount of $12,125.00. The Applicant indicates that she is in the process of negotiating 
a settlement agreement with the creditor and plans to pay it off soon.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Reply to FORM).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(b).  The Applicant was indebted to a bank in the approximate amount of $4,072.00.  The Applicant has settled this debt and satisfied it in full.

Applicant's Response to SOR, Letter dated November 23, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(d).  The Applicant was indebted to a bank in the approximate amount of $1,276.00.  The Applicant  has settled this debt and satisfied it in full.  
(<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Reply to FORM, Letter from creditor dated October 6, 2004).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(e).  The Applicant is indebted to a bank in the approximate amount of $1,034.00.  The Applicant is in the process of negotiating a settlement with 
the creditor and plans to pay it off soon.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Reply to FORM). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(f).  The Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $468.00.  The Applicant is not responsible for this debt as the divorce 
decree assigned it to her husband.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Response to SOR, copy of divorce decree).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(g).  The Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $435.00.  The Applicant is not responsible for this debt as the divorce 
decree assigned it to her husband.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Reply to FORM, Letter dated October 5, 2004 and Response to SOR, copy of divorce decree).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(h).  The Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $2,468.00.   The Applicant is not responsible for this debt as the divorce 
decree assigned it to her husband.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Response to SOR, copy of divorce decree).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Allegation 1(i).  The Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount $80.00.  This debt is currently in dispute and has not been paid.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Applicant's Response to SOR, Letter dated October 10, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(j).  The Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $1,034.00.  The Applicant asserts that this is a duplicate of the debt set 
forth in allegation 1(e).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(k).  The Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $867.00.  The Applicant has settled this debt and satisfied it in full.  
(<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Response to SOR, Letter dated November 11, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1(l).  The Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $1,920.00.  The Applicant is not responsible for this debt as the divorce 
decree assigned it to her husband.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Response to SOR, copy of divorce decree).  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6. The person has initiated a good faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant was financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor 
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a 
nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to her finances, the Applicant's excessive indebtedness was partially caused by her divorce in 2002.  The rest of the debt was accumulated because 
of poor financial decisions.  Since then, she has made great strides to pay off her outstanding debts and resolve her financial problems.  The Applicant has paid 
off most of her outstanding delinquent debts.  She has provided a copy of her divorce decree that sets forth those debts that are solely her husbands 
responsibility.  Only two of her debts remain outstanding, and she is in the process of getting them settled and paid off.  Her financial statement indicates that 
she is capable of paying her past due debts and she is in the process of paying them.  Mitigating Conditions <EM>3, The conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>, and<EM> 
6,The person has initiated a good faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts </EM>in the Directive under Guideline F apply.  Accordingly, I find for the 
Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
