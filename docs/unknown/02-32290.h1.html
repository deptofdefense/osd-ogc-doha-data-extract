<P>The Applicant committed three security violations, one in 1985, one in 1988 and one in1998.  He has not committed a security violation in the last six years.  
His security violations have been mitigated by a sufficient showing of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is granted.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 26, 2004 and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on April 8, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 27, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 15, 2004.  Applicant's counsel requested a 
continuance on June 8, 2004.  The matter was continued until August 4, 2004.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented 
eight exhibits and he testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 23, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, his testimony and the documents.  The Applicant is</SPAN> 59 years of age, has an 
Engineering fellowship and is employed by a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline K- Security Violations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant's noncompliance with security regulations may raise doubts about 
his trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology Systems)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant's noncompliance with rules, procedures, 
guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about his trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
properly protect classified systems, networks, and information.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been employed in the defense industry for thirty years.  He received his first security clearance in the early 70's.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1985, the Applicant left his safe that contained classified materials unlocked.  The Applicant contends that he spun the dial to lock his safe, but obviously did 
not spin it enough.  A security guard while demonstrating to someone else how to check the safe, spun the lock, turned the latch, and the Applicant's safe 
opened.  This surprised both the Applicant and the security guard.  A security violation was issued to the Applicant.  This was a violation of company rules, 
procedures and guidelines and a violation of paragraph 14 of DoD 5220.22-M, the Industrial Security Manual(ISM), dated December 1985.  The Applicant 
received a written reprimand for this violation. The Applicant testified that since then he has learned to properly spin the lock.  He then goes around and checks 
the other safes in the area by spinning them in the forward direction</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1989, the Applicant was working on a proposal using classified materials.  During a conference call he disclosed Secret classified information to an 
uncleared personnel by providing a Secret document to a secretary to fax an unclassified portion of the document without authorization.  Providing a classified 
document to an uncleared individual is a security violation.  This was a violation of company rules, procedure and guidelines and a violation of paragraph 17 of 
DoD 5220.22-M, the Industrial Security Manual (ISM), dated November 1986. The Applicant explained that he was preoccupied when he handed the classified 
document to the uncleared secretary.  It did not occur to him that the document was classified or that he should check to see if the person was wearing a badge 
indicating that they were cleared or not before giving the classified document to them.  (Tr. P. 25).  The Applicant testified that the uncleared secretary was new 
to his department  and had recently been assigned him.  She did not work in his department long.  The Applicant received a security violation for this conduct.  
The Applicant was subsequently advised of his responsibility to protect classified information in his possession. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1998, while working in a secured environment, (a SCIF) the Applicant knowingly removed a file from a classified computer system without 
authorization.  Since the file or disk was used on a classified computer, the disk became classified.  It was also discovered  through a search of the Applicant's 
computer and his files that he had classified materials at the confidential level on his home computer.  The Applicant admitted that he downloaded information 
form his computer hard drive at work and transferred it to a floppy disk.  He then brought the disk home.  He downloaded the information on the floppy disk to 
his home computer hard drive.  By doing this, he improperly removed, stored and transported the classified information without authorization to do so.  This 
was a violation of company rules, procedure and guidelines and a violation of paragraphs 5-100, 5-304, 5-404 and 8-100 of DoD 5220.22-M, the National 
Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), dated January 1995.  The Applicant further explained that if he were to have followed proper 
company procedures, he would have taken the floppy disk to the company Security Office and told them that he believed the disk to be unclassified and that he 
would like to remove it.  Instead, because the security department was slow at getting to this task, the Applicant took the disk, realizing at the time that he was 
committing a security violation.  The Applicant received a security violation for this conduct and was suspended for a week without pay.  (Tr. p. 22).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that he has no excuse for his three security violations.  He realizes the seriousness of his misconduct and does not expect them to ever 
happen again.  He states that he is always very careful now when working with or handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Security Violations</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Unauthorized disclosure of classified information;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Misuse of Information Technology Systems</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual's 
trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information.  Information Technology Systems include all related 
equipment used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, and storage of classified or sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Introduction of hardware, software or media into any information technology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, 
guidelines or regulations. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The misuse was not recent or significant;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  The misuse was an isolated event.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; to include violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</P> 
 
<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of </P> 
 
<P>variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be 
considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the 
evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized 
by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall 
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline K, (Security Violations), Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown 
between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, 
objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a disregard for security policies and procedure, or who engages in a pattern of rule violations, may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a 
security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's security violations, misuse of 
information technology systems and his personal conduct have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the approximate thirty year period the Applicant was employed with the defense industry, he has committed three security violations prohibited by his 
company rules, procedure, and guidelines.  He has also violated specific provisions of the Industrial Security Manual in affect at the time of the violations.  
None of the security violations were committed with deliberate or reckless disregard for company policy or defense industry procedures.  Each violation is 
different and was committed inadvertently.  Each violation occurred several years apart.  In each instance, the Applicant learned that he must be more careful in 
handling classified information.  The Applicant has not committed any security violation in six years.  He has taken these violations seriously and realizes that 
he cannot commit any more.  Under Guideline K, mitigating conditions, 1. <EM>The violations were inadvertent</EM>, 2. <EM>The violations were isolated and infrequent</EM>, and 
4. <EM>The Applicant demonstrates a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities</EM> apply.  Under Guideline M, mitigating conditions 1<EM>.  The 
misuse was not recent or significant </EM>2. <EM>The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent, </EM>3.  <EM>The misuse was an isolated event </EM> apply.  Under Guideline E, 
mitigating condition 5<EM>.  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress </EM>applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for 
the Applicant under Guideline K (Security Violations), Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his security violations, misuse of computer technology and personal 
conduct.  The Applicant has  met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines K, M or E of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate 
burden of persuasion under Guidelines K, M and E.</SPAN></P>
