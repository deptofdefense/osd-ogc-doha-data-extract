  Although the Administrative Judge acknowledged the proper burden of proof, the Judge misapplied it in this case.  The record evidence does not support the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1, 3 and 5.  The Judge's obligation to apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative  Guidelines is complementary to, not exclusive of, the Judge's obligation to evaluate an applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept.  The  Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for why he concluded the favorable evidence presented by Applicant showed refutation, extenuation, or mitigation of  the security concerns raised under Guideline B.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 10, 2003, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  
Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro issued a favorable security clearance decision, dated January 5, 2005.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 applied; 
(2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 applied; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by 
concluding Applicant was entitled to some consideration under Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5; and (4) whether the Administrative Judge's favorable 
decision is sustainable under the whole person concept.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 applied</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that security 
concerns were raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) because of Applicant's ties and contacts with four brothers and two sisters who are citizens and 
residents of Taiwan.  Department Counsel challenges the Judge's conclusion those security concerns were mitigated under Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  In support of that challenge, Department Counsel argues:</P> 
<P>(a) the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to Department Counsel to disprove the applicability of Mitigating Condition 1;</P> 
<P>(b) the Judge gave undue weight to his conclusion that there is no evidence that Taiwan has sought to exploit Applicant's relatives in the past;</P> 
<P>(c) the Judge gave undue weight to his finding that Taiwan is a friendly country;</P> 
<P>(d) the Judge ignored record evidence that runs contrary to the Judge's characterization of U.S.-Taiwan relations and shows security concerns exist despite the 
friendly nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations; and</P> 
<P>(e) the Judge evaluated the security significance of Applicant's family ties in a piecemeal manner.</P> 
<P>In support of the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, Applicant argues:</P> 
<P>(i) the Judge specifically stated that the burden of proof rests with Applicant;</P> 
<P>(ii) although the Judge mentions the absence of evidence of past coercion by Taiwan, that portion of the decision does not constitute the focus of the Judge's 
analysis;</P> 
<P>(iii) it was proper for the Judge to take into account the friendly nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations; and</P> 
<P>(iv)  in the alternative, even if the Board were to conclude that the Judge erred, any such error was harmless because the Judge's application of Foreign 
Influence Mitigating Condition 1 "was ultimately based on [Applicant's] evidence regarding himself, his family and his life and not on Taiwan's friendliness or 
the absence of evidence of prior coercion by Taiwan."</P> 
<P>For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department Counsel has demonstrated the Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
<P>(a) Applicant correctly notes that the Administrative Judge specifically states that the burden of persuasion rests with Applicant.  However, there are passages in 
the decision below that indicate the Judge based his conclusion about Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 on the absence of certain kinds of evidence, 
which makes sense only if the Judge was assuming or deciding that Department Counsel had the burden of presenting such evidence in order to disprove 
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 was applicable to Applicant's case.  Although the Judge stated the burden of proof standard properly, the Judge's 
decision exhibits reasoning that runs contrary to that standard.  When faced with what appears to be a conflict or divergence between a Judge's statement of the 
correct legal standard to be applied and the Judge's application of that legal standard in a particular case, the Board must decide the following: (i) whether the 
conflict or divergence is real or only apparent; and (ii) if the conflict or divergence is real, whether harmful error has occurred.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Considering the Administrative Judge's decision as a whole, the Board concludes the Judge  misapplied the burden of proof.  Applicant has the burden of 
proving the applicability of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  Department Counsel does not have the burden of presenting evidence to disprove the 
applicability of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  By relying on the absence of certain kinds of evidence to draw conclusions favorable to Applicant 
concerning Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, the Judge was -- for all practical purposes -- shifting the burden of proof from Applicant to Department 
Counsel.</P> 
<P>(b) Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge gave undue weight to his conclusion that there is no evidence Taiwan has sought to 
exploit Applicant's relatives in the past.  There is no requirement that Department Counsel present evidence that an applicant poses a clear and present danger 
or imminent threat to national security.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Nor is Department Counsel required to present evidence that Taiwan has sought to exploit Applicant's relatives in the 
past.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  By focusing on the absence of such evidence, the Judge was drawing conclusions favorable to Applicant because Department Counsel did not present a 
kind of evidence that it had no obligation to present.  Applicant's counter-argument -- (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the Judge mentioned the absence of evidence of past coercion, but 
it does not constitute the "focus" of the Judge's analysis) -- is not persuasive.  </P> 
<P>(c) The Administrative Judge used his finding that Taiwan is a friendly country in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Given the wording of the decision 
(especially Decision at pp. 6-7, where Judge specifically states that certain information "is significant in determining whether a security concern exists . . ."), we 
conclude the Judge was plainly signaling that he was giving great weight to such evidence -- and in the process cited reasons that fail to provide rational 
support for his favorable conclusions.</P> 
<P>First, the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries with stable, democratic or representative forms of government engage in 
intelligence gathering.  Totalitarian regimes and dictatorial governments are not the only ones engaging in espionage.  Accordingly, the Judge articulated no 
rationale for his conclusion that the stability of Taiwan's democratic form of government reduces the security risk in Applicant's case.</P> 
<P>Second, the countries cited in the preceding paragraph, and others, have good human rights records, yet engage in intelligence gathering.  The Judge's 
conclusion that Taiwan's improved human rights record reduces the security risk makes sense only if the Judge was focusing on coercive forms of influence or 
pressure and ignoring the risk of noncoercive forms of influence or pressure.  Nothing in Guideline B limits or restricts its scope to coercive forms of foreign 
influence.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, although evidence that a foreign country engages in human rights violations can have probative value in showing that an applicant's 
immediate family members in that country may be more vulnerable to coercive pressure from the foreign government, such evidence is not a requirement under 
Guideline B.  Not all forms of influence or pressure that a foreign government may try exert on an individual involve violations of human rights.</P> 
<P>Third, the Administrative Judge's discussion about Taiwan's trade contacts with the People's Republic of China is irrelevant to whether Applicant's family ties 
render him vulnerable to foreign influence or pressure.</P> 
<P>Fourth, the Administrative Judge failed to articulate how sales of U.S. military equipment to Taiwan have anything to do with assessing Applicant's security 
eligibility.  The fact that the United States sells  military equipment to a particular country does not have any apparent relevance to the security eligibility of a 
particular applicant, nor does it have any apparent probative value as to whether that country has an interest in gaining unauthorized access to U.S. classified 
information.</P> 
<P>Fifth, Department Counsel correctly notes that Guideline B (Foreign Influence) does not differentiate between friendly and hostile countries.  The compelling 
government interest in protecting classified information,<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> is not limited to protecting classified information only from persons, organizations, or countries that 
have interests that are inimical to the United States.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>For all these reasons, taken cumulatively, the Board concludes the Administrative Judge relied on his finding that Taiwan is a friendly country in a manner that 
is arbitrary and capricious.</P> 
<P>(d) There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically stated otherwise.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  A party's 
personal belief, however sincerely held, is not sufficient to raise a serious question as to whether a Judge considered the record evidence; rather, there must be 
some basis in the record that would permit a reasonable, disinterested person to fairly question whether the Judge considered the record evidence.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The 
presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence can be rebutted when a party can point to significant record evidence that runs contrary to a 
Judge's findings and conclusions, and which -- as a matter of common sense or practical reasoning -- should have been explicitly acknowledged and expressly 
taken into account in order for the Judge's analysis to be reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In this case, Department Counsel is correct in pointing 
out that the Judge focused on the evidence concerning the friendly nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations and failed to mention or discuss contrary record evidence 
that indicated Taiwan could pose a security risk.</P> 
<P>(e) There is merit to Department Counsel's contention that the Administrative Judge evaluated the security significance of Applicant's family ties in a 
piecemeal manner.  Given the evidence concerning the totality of Applicant's ties with relatives in Taiwan,<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for 
his conclusion that the totality of those family ties did not pose a security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</P> 
<P>The Board does not find persuasive Applicant's argument that it is improper for Department Counsel to argue about relatives of his in Taiwan who were not 
specifically referenced in the SOR.  An SOR is not a criminal indictment, and not every relevant piece of evidence has to be cited in an SOR.  Matters not 
specifically alleged in an SOR, but fairly raised during a hearing (with the applicant having notice and an opportunity to respond) can be considered to be part 
of the case.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Significantly, during the proceedings below Applicant did not object to references about the children of his siblings (<EM>see</EM> Applicant's answer to 
SOR; Hearing Transcript at pp. 73, 116-117).  Nor did Applicant object when he was asked about his wife's parents in Taiwan (Hearing Transcript at pp. 106-107), his wife's siblings (Hearing Transcript at pp. 115-116), his wife's ties to Taiwan (Hearing Transcript at pp. 107, 121), whether he was providing support 
to anyone in Taiwan (Hearing Transcript at p. 128), or whether he had contacts with professionals in either Taiwan or the People's Republic of China (Hearing 
Transcript at pp. 129, 132-133).  Applicant had ample opportunity to object to any questions about relatives of his or other people not listed in the SOR, and he 
did not do so.  And, during closing argument, Applicant's counsel said his client should get credit for being open about his nieces and nephews (Hearing 
Transcript at p. 192).  In view of the foregoing, Applicant waived any objection to references about his nieces and nephews.</P> 
<P>Moreover, as a matter of common sense and practical experience, an applicant's ties with his or her siblings cannot be considered in isolation from the 
immediate families of those siblings.  The facts and circumstances of the immediate family of an applicant's siblings may be relevant to assessing the security 
significance of the applicant's ties with those siblings.  The Board has held that a Judge can consider the security significance of an applicant's ties with his or 
her in-laws (who are not immediate family members, as defined in Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1) on the premise that the applicant could be 
influenced or pressured through the parents of his or her spouse.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Furthermore, although Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 refers to "immediate family 
members," Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 1 refers to "[a]n immediate family member, <EM>or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection 
or obligation</EM>. . . ."<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Similarly, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions 2, 3, and 4<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> refer to categories of persons other than an applicant's immediate 
family members.  Accordingly, security concerns can be raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) by ties to persons other than immediate family members. 
Accordingly, it is not persuasive for Applicant to contend that evidence concerning the children of his siblings is not pertinent to an evaluation of his security 
eligibility under Guideline B.</P> 
<P>Applicant's counter argument about his family ties is not persuasive, because it focuses largely on the lack of family ties to the Taiwanese government, and the 
lack of prominence of his relatives in Taiwan.  Because Mitigating Condition 1 is bifurcated in nature, the absence of evidence that Applicant's relatives are 
agents of the Taiwanese government is not dispositive.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Moreover, the Board has rejected the assumption that the lack of prominence means there are no 
security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  There is no good reason to assume that a foreign government interested in gaining unauthorized 
access to classified U.S. information would consider exerting influence or pressure only when an applicant has relatives abroad who are prominent persons.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>(f) The Board does not find persuasive Applicant's argument that it is "inconceivable" to him that anyone could seek to exploit him through his relatives in 
Taiwan.  Applicant's personal opinion about the security significance of his family ties is not entitled to much weight.  In making security clearance decisions, 
the federal government is not constrained by an applicant's opinion about the security significance of the applicant's conduct and circumstances.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  
Furthermore, what is or is not conceivable to an applicant does not have probative value as to what is or is not conceivable to a foreign government.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's reliance on the Administrative Judge decision in ISCR Case No. 02-20356 (November 26, 2003) is misplaced.  Apart from the fact that the decision 
in that case is not legally binding on the Board, that decision is wholly unpersuasive because the Judge explicitly used reasoning that has not been accepted by 
the Board in similar Guideline B (Foreign Influence) cases.  Moreover, the Judge's analysis in that case appears to be based, in part, on reasoning that treats a 
favorable credibility determination as record evidence and says that credible testimony must be given significant weight.  Although a credibility determination 
is an important part of a Judge's evaluation of witness testimony, a credibility determination -- whether it is favorable or unfavorable -- is not a substitute for 
record evidence in support of a party's case.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's reliance on the Board decision in ISCR Case No. 99-0331 (May 26, 1999) also is misplaced.  Department Counsel is not arguing for a <EM>per se</EM> rule in 
this case.  Rather, Department Counsel is arguing that the facts and circumstances of Applicant's ties and contacts with family members in Taiwan and his 
ownership of property interests in Taiwan raise security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and that Applicant did not meet his burden of 
presenting evidence sufficient to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those security concerns.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 applies</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred by 
applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> because: (a) the frequency of contacts is separate from the nature of the contacts; and (b) the record 
evidence -- viewed in its entirety -- indicates Applicant's ties are not casual in nature.  Applicant asserts the Judge's application of this mitigating condition is 
warranted because he presented evidence showing his contacts with his relatives in Taiwan are limited and casual in nature.</P> 
<P>Applicant is correct in noting there is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members are not casual in nature,<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and correct that an 
applicant has the opportunity to present evidence to rebut or overcome that presumption.  However, Applicant's argument that the evidence shows he has 
limited contacts with relatives in Taiwan does not have the significance that he seeks to attribute to it.  Department Counsel is correct in noting that the 
frequency of an applicant's contacts is not the same as the nature of those contacts.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case concerning the nature of 
Applicant's contacts with his relatives in Taiwan, Department Counsel's claim of error is persuasive.  Given the Administrative Judge's own findings of fact 
about Applicant's contacts and ties with relatives in Taiwan (including Applicant's potential for future travel to Taiwan in the event of any serious health 
problem involving his family there, or their death), the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for concluding that application of Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 3 was warranted.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude Applicant was entitled to some consideration under Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 5</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge properly concluded that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 8<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> 
applied because of Applicant's property interests in Taiwan, but erred by then concluding Applicant was entitled to some consideration under Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 5<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> because: (a) the Judge undervalued Applicant's Taiwan property; (b) there is no record evidence that Applicant is currently entitled to 
his disability benefits, and the Judge neglected to consider the testimony that Applicant would be liable for an early withdrawal penalty; (c) the Judge failed to 
give due weight to Applicant's sentimental and familial connections to his property in Taiwan; and (d) the record evidence shows Applicant has taken steps to 
retain his property in Taiwan, and that evidence shows it is valuable to him.  Applicant responds that the Judge did not err, arguing that the record evidence 
supports the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5.</P> 
<P>Given the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant's property interests in Taiwan are not minimal, the Judge properly noted that Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 5 was not applicable in light of its wording (Decision at p. 8).  The question before the Board is whether the Judge articulated a 
sustainable rationale for his decision that Applicant "is entitled to some consideration under [Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5]."  That decision is 
predicated on his conclusion that Applicant's property interests in Taiwan "are not sufficient to affect his security responsibilities" (Decision at p. 8).</P> 
<P>Given the Administrative Judge's own findings of fact about Applicant's property interests in Taiwan, and the Judge's conclusion that those foreign property 
interests are significant enough to fall under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 8, the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for his conclusion that 
those foreign property interests "are not sufficient to affect [Applicant's] security responsibilities."  Department Counsel  persuasively argues that the record 
evidence shows Applicant has sentimental and familial connections to his property in Taiwan, and he has taken various steps with respect to the handling of his 
property in Taiwan that show it is valuable to him.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Moreover, the Judge failed to explain how Applicant's stated intent to divest himself of the property in 
Taiwan over the next three to five years is mitigating at this time.</P> 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable decision is sustainable under the whole person concept</SPAN>.  In challenging the Administrative Judge's decision, 
Department Counsel also contends the Judge's favorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility are arbitrary and capricious and not supported by the 
record evidence as a whole.  And, Applicant's reply brief asks the Board to affirm the Judge's decision as being consistent with the whole person concept.  
Taken together, those arguments raise the issue of whether the Judge's favorable decision is sustainable under the whole person concept.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>An Administrative Judge must apply pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  However, a Judge's obligation to apply 
pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines does not override the Judge's obligation to evaluate an applicant's security eligibility in light of the whole 
person concept.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the mere presence or absence of an Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of a 
case.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Even if there is an Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating condition that is applicable, a Judge must consider the applicable disqualifying 
or mitigating condition in light of the record evidence as a whole and any pertinent general factors,<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> and decide what weight can reasonably be given to the 
applicable disqualifying or mitigating condition.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  And, if a Judge reasonably concludes that particular Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating 
conditions do not apply to the specific of a case, the Judge still must evaluate the applicant's security eligibility under the general factors of Directive, Section 
6.3 and Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.1 (which refers to the whole person concept).<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes: (a) the Department Counsel's claims of error regarding specific provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines do not 
preclude its claims that the Judge reached favorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility that are arbitrary and capricious and not supported by the 
record evidence; and (b) the Board's rulings that Department Counsel has demonstrated error in the Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines do not 
foreclose Applicant from arguing that the Judge's decision is sustainable under the whole person concept.</P> 
<P>Applicant correctly argues that deference should be given to the Administrative Judge's credibility determinations.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  However, Department Counsel is not 
required to challenge the Judge's credibility determinations in order to raise claims of error based on grounds unrelated to those credibility determinations.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  
oreover, as noted earlier in this decision, a credibility determination is not a substitute for record evidence, and it does not relieve a Judge of the obligation to 
consider a witness's testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the Judge's favorable assessment of Applicant's credibility does not 
satisfy the Judge's obligation to evaluate Applicant's security eligibility in light of the record evidence as a whole.</P> 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, there is merit to Department Counsel's contention that the Administrative Judge evaluated the security significance of 
Applicant's family ties in a piecemeal manner.  Such a piecemeal analysis of Applicant's ties with relatives in Taiwan is not consistent with the whole person 
concept.</P> 
<P>Because the Administrative Judge erred in his application of pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines, the continued viability of the Judge's 
favorable conclusions about the Applicant's security eligibility under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) turns on whether the Judge articulated a rational basis for 
those favorable conclusions that is consistent with a whole person analysis in light of the record evidence as a whole.  The Judge's whole person analysis 
focuses on a brief recitation of Applicant's employment record, Applicant's scholarly accomplishments, his reputation with supervisors and coworkers, his 
stable family life, his financial acquisitions in the United States, and the academic accomplishments of his daughter (Decision at p. 8).  Apart from  simply 
reciting these favorable facts, the Judge did not discuss or explain how they refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence) by the record evidence of Applicant's ties and contacts with immediate family members and other relatives in Taiwan and Applicant's not 
insignificant property interests in that country.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Having reasonably concluded that  the record evidence raised security concerns under Guideline B, the Judge 
failed to articulate a discernable, rational basis for why he concluded the favorable facts he recited showed refutation, extenuation, or mitigation of those 
security concerns.  Because the favorable facts recited by the Judge do not readily suggest refutation, extenuation, or mitigation of the security concerns raised 
under Guideline B,<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> the Judge's recitation of those favorable facts was not sufficient to support his favorable conclusions under Guideline B.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  The Judge's 
recitation of favorable facts not having any discernible connection to the security concerns raised under Guideline B suggests an arbitrary and capricious 
analysis.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  Applicant's arguments in support of affirming the Judge's evaluation of his security eligibility under the whole person concept are not persuasive.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated several errors below that, taken cumulatively, warrant reversal.  Accordingly, pursuant to Directive, Additional

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Dissenting Opinion of Administrative Judge Michael Y. Ra'anan</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>My analysis of this case differs considerably from my colleagues' view.  Therefore I set it forth below.</P> 
<P>(1) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in his application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  Department Counsel argues that the Administrative 
Judge misapplied Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Mitigating Condition (MC) 1<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> for three reasons: (a) the Judge erroneously shifted the  burden from 
Applicant to the Department Counsel, (b) the Judge misused his finding that Taiwan is a friend ly country and (c) Applicant had failed to meet his burden of 
demonstrating that the second prong of MC 1 applied to Applicant's situation.  Only the third argument is persuasive.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel's  first argument is not persuasive because (with one exception which will be discussed in the context of Department Counsel's third 
argument) there is nothing in the Administrative Judge's decision which suggests that he shifted the burden to the government of disproving a mitigating 
condition.  Indeed, the Judge specifically noted that the burden shifts to the Applicant to demonstrate mitigation once the government has met its burden of 
proving controverted facts.  The Judge specifically noted, "Still, the Applicant bears the burden of demonstrating his family ties with relatives living in Taiwan 
do not pose a security risk."</P> 
<P>Department Counsel's second argument is not persuasive.  The Administrative Judge did cite Taiwan's friendly relations with the United States which is a 
reasonable interpretation of the government's exhibits.  However, a full reading of the Judge's decision leads me to conclude that the Judge did not rely 
disproportionately on Taiwan's friendly status in reaching his conclusions.  Rather, the Judge focused on his perception of the quality and quantity of 
Applicant's family ties.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel's third argument<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> is persuasive.</P> 
<P>The Board has previously noted that an Administrative Judge does not have unfettered discretion when deciding whether particular provisions of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable.  Rather, a Judge must exercise sound judgment within the parameters set by the Directive when deciding which 
Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions are applicable to the particular facts of a given case.  Accordingly, when a Judge's application of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is challenged on appeal, the Board must consider whether the appealing party has shown the Judge's application is (a) not 
supported by the record evidence; (b) arbitrary or capricious; or (c) contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-15339 (April 29, 2004), at p. 4.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel did not challenge the Judge's conclusion that Applicant's relatives in Taiwan were not agents of a foreign power.  However, the Board has 
previously noted that Guideline B MC 1 is bifurcated in nature and places the burden on applicants to establish that their immediate family members or other 
persons to whom they have close ties of affection or obligation and who reside in a foreign country are not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.  <EM>See</EM>,<EM> e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-15339 (April 29, 2004) at p. 4.  Department 
Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge's application of this second prong of MC 1 was arbitrary and capricious.</P> 
<P>The Judge wrote that "The best predictor of whether Applicant's relatives are in a position to be exploited in the future is the Taiwan government's past 
conduct."  He went on to say that the Taiwanese government had not taken any action to exploit Applicant's relationship with his Taiwanese relatives.  The 
Judge's reasoning here is erroneous for several reasons.  There is no basis in this record nor does the Judge explain a logical basis for the supposition as to what 
is the best predictor.  Neither the Government of Taiwan nor any other entity had a known incentive to exploit Applicant's relationships when he did not yet 
have a security clearance.  It is not a reasonable supposition  that the only entity which might seek to exploit Applicant's foreign relationships is the government 
of Taiwan.  The Judge's reasoning implicitly shifted the burden of production in the application of this mitigating condition from Applicant to Department 
Counsel.  For all these reasons the Judge's reasoning is unpersuasive.  The Judge also cited other factors albeit with less vigor.  None of the factors cited by the 
Judge justify the application of the second prong of MC 1.</P> 
<P>(2) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in his application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge applied Guideline B MC 3<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  
to Applicant's benefit.  Regarding MC 3, the Board has previously noted that there is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members 
are not casual.  Given the Administrative Judge's own findings of fact concerning Applicant's potential for future travel to Taiwan in the event of serious health 
problem involving his family there or their death, that presumption is actually bolstered by the facts of this case.  Therefore, the Judge had no rational basis to 
apply MC 3 (which requires the contact with foreign citizens to be both casual and infrequent) in this case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No 02-15339 (April 29, 2004) 
at p. 5.</P> 
<P>(3)<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> Whether the Administrative Judge erred in his application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 5</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge gave Applicant some credit 
under Guideline B MC 5.<A HREF="02-22461.a1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A>  Although not a model of clarity, the Judge analysis is plausible.  He apparently recognized that Applicant's situation did conform 
to the language of MC5, but reasoned that Applicant was entitled to some credit under one portion of the guideline and explained the basis for his deviation 
from the plain language of the guideline.  The Judge's analysis was within the bounds of his discretion.</P> 
<P>(4) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's errors are sufficient to alter the outcome of the case given the unchallenged portions of the Judge's decision</SPAN>.  In 
addition to the Administrative Judge's conclusions challenged by Department Counsel, the Judge analyzed Applicant's situation separately using a whole 
person approach.  The Judge's whole person analysis is not challenged by Department Counsel.  Indeed, Department Counsel's brief implies that such a 
challenge is unnecessary ("Therefore, because none of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions apply in the present case and because the record evidence 
reflects extensive financial familial and sentimental contacts between Applicant and Taiwan, the Administrative Judge committed harmful error when he 
concluded that Guideline B security concerns were mitigated.").</P> 
<P>The Board has repeatedly rejected the notion that individual adjudicative guidelines are dispositive or that an Administrative  Judge cannot render a favorable 
decision in the absence of an applicable Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition.  (<EM>See</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-12882 (July 20, 2005), at pp. 5-6 discussing 
earlier Board decisions).</P> 
<P>It is well settled that there is no presumption of error.  Since I conclude there is one portion of the Judge's decision which survived the Department Counsel 
challenge and another portion of the Judge's decision which is unchallenged, the errors demonstrated by Department Counsel are not sufficient to justify 
remand or reversal of the case.</P>

witness's factual testimony.  Moreover, an applicant's opinion that his or her conduct or circumstances do not pose a security risk is not controlling.  The 
federal government is not constrained to deny or revoke a security clearance only when an applicant agrees that he or she poses a security risk.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR

Department Counsel" (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15).  Although strict rules of evidence are not applied in these proceedings 
(Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.19), the admission of record evidence does not relieve an Administrative Judge of the need to base his or 
her findings and conclusions on "relevant and material information" (Directive, Section 6.3) and to reach conclusions that are not arbitrary or capricious 
(Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3). 
<P><A NAME="N_39_">39. </A> For example, although Applicant can be justifiably proud of the academic accomplishment of his daughter, her academic accomplishments have no apparent

professional, they do not appear to have any discernible bearing on whether Applicant has refuted, extenuated, or mitigated the security concerns under 
Guideline B.  The presence or absence of scholarly accomplishments by an applicant does not have any readily apparent bearing on whether an applicant is 
vulnerable to foreign influence.
