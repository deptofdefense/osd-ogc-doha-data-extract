<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of reasons (SOR) dated November 4, 2003 which stated the 
reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated 
July 30, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for his unfavorable security clearance decision.  
For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify 
how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 
00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or 
(2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary 
or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it 
reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the 
record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) 
at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether 
they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not 
required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are 
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect 
a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party 
challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.  When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of 
review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).   If an appealing party demonstrates factual 
or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="02-29726.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision, including his entire challenge under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), is 
based in large part on new evidence.  The Board is not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See, </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  All that remains are some of Applicant's claims under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that his overseas relatives, friends and travel should not bar him from  holding a security clearance.  Given the totality of Applicant's 
circumstances at the time the record closed, the Judge's adverse decision on those allegations was rational.  Applicant held and had recently used a 
Hong Kong Passport in travel there and to Taiwan, had Hong Kong citizenship, had relatives and friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Applicant has not 
demonstrated that the Judge erred in his analysis of Applicant's foreign ties.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error in the Administrative Judge's July 30, 2004 decisions.  Therefore, that 
decision is affirmed.</P>
