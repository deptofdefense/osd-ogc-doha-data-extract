<P>Applicant's conduct raises security concerns over his repeated problematic and misguided personal and criminal conduct over his relationships with 
his estranged wife and two girlfriends which led to termination of employment with two defense contractors and repeated convictions for criminal 
conduct in the 1993-1998 period. While the therapy in 1998-99 helped him to better understand the whole pattern of his behavior, Applicant has 
not again been involved with a woman, so the expert witness could not predict with certainty what his future personal conduct would be if he were 
disappointed in a romantic relationship.   Except for the incident in1980, doubt remains as to whether he is fully rehabilitated given this repeated 
pattern of rule violations in his personal life and given his long history of questionable conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on April 18, 2001.  The SOR 
detailed reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns in personal conduct (Guideline E) and criminal conduct 
(Guideline J).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on May 10, 2001, where he admitted with explanations 
paragraphs 1.a. though 1.d., 1.g, 1.i through 1.l., but denied 1.e., 1.f.,1. h.; he admitted paragraph 2 and subparagraph 2.a.  He requested a 
hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on June 6, 2001, attested it was ready to proceed.  On June 8, 2001, the case was assigned 
to me.  On June 13, 2001, Applicant's counsel entered his appearance.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on June 20, 2001, which set the matter for July 10, 2001, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At 
the hearing the Government introduced nine exhibits which were all admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-9).  The applicant's counsel called 
Applicant and two other individuals to testify.  After the hearing a document was forwarded from the company which  sought to clarify a fact; as 
neither Applicant's counsel or the government counsel objected, that letter was admitted into evidence as Applicant's Exhibit A on July 19, 2001.  
The record then closed.  The  transcript (TR) was received on July 19, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the 
following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 39 years old, has been an employee of Defense Contractor #3 in State #1 since November 1997.  Initially, he was granted a Secret 
security clearance in August 1983 when he worked for Defense Contractor #1.  After he was terminated by them in 1994, he began work for 
Defense Contractor #2 and applied for a security clearance by completing a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) in 
February 1994.  Applicant was involuntarily terminated by them in November 1997.  His security clearance has been downgraded from time to 
time, but it has never been suspended.  (Answer; TR 24, 41-42, 55-56; Exhibits 1, 7, 8)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG> <STRONG>and Criminal Conduct </STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has had a series of arrests and convictions as well as terminations from two defense contractor employers:</P> 
 
<P> In 1980 Applicant pleaded guilty to Avoiding Payment of Telecommunications for long distance calls made in 1979 to a girl friend where he 
billed the charges to a fictitious phone number; he was fined, which was suspended, and given one year of probation conditioned upon his making 
restitution of $650 in 30 days.  (Answer; TR 42-43, 56-57)</P> 
 
<P> In January 1993 Applicant went to visit his estranged wife at 4 AM and had intercourse with her as he did not want the divorce; he afterwards 
told her that the sexual act, which he said was voluntary, would delay the divorce.  He subsequently was charged with Aggravated Sexual Battery, 
a felony offense, to which he pleaded nolo contendere; the case was continued for one year provided he had no contact with his estranged spouse 
and remained on good behavior.   He violated the court's order and was sentenced to serve six months on the city farm, with all but one day 
suspended.  He again violated the court's order by having contact with his estranged spouse and was required to appear and pleaded guilty to a 
reduced charge of Sexual Battery.  He was ordered to have no contact with his estranged spouse and family for two years, to complete Anger 
anagement classes; his six months sentence was suspended provided he did not violate any court orders.   In April 1994 Defense Contractor #2 
submitted an adverse information report on the April 1994 guilty plea to Sexual Battery.   He completed the anger management class as part of the 
agreement.   (Answer; TR 24-26, 47-49, 57; Exhibits 3, 4, 9)</P> 
 
<P> In August 1993 he was arrested and charged with Burglary, a felony offense when he broke a window at his estranged spouse's apartment 
when she refused to let him in; he served one day in jail and the charge was <EM>nolle prossed</EM>.  (Answer; TR 26-27; Exhibit 9)</P> 
 
<P> In February 1994 he threatened his estranged spouse at work and admits he struck her with some boxes when he was using a hand truck to 
move office equipment.  Despite his self-reported good work record, this incident led to his termination from Defense Contractor #1 for violation 
of a rule against "threatening, intimidating or coercing another employee."  (Answer; TR 27-28, 49; Exhibit 9)</P> 
 
<P> After his divorce, in June 1994 he was charged with Abusive Language-Telephone for making several phone calls to a former girlfriend 
(Girlfriend #1) even though she was married.  He had originally been involved with her from 1983 to 1987.  In July 1994 he was charged with 
making Obscene and Harassing Phone Calls to her spouse.  He filed counter charges; in September 1994 he was ordered not to have any contact 
with the couple and to pay court costs; all charges were dismissed.  He realized it was wrong for him to attempt to coerce a relationship with her 
by using blackmail.  (TR 29-30, 49-50, 57; Exhibit 7)</P> 
 
<P> From 1995-1997 he lived with a girlfriend (Girlfriend #2) .  When he became unhappy with her in September 1997 he ordered her out of his 
house; after she resisted by calling 911, he grabbed her inappropriately and she fell to the floor.  In April 1998 he went to her apartment 
unannounced and again, after some conversation, "grabbed" her.  (Answer; TR 35-37, 58; Exhibits 6, 7)  Despite being an excellent employee, 
Applicant was terminated by Defense Contractor #2 in November 1997 after he harassed his former girlfriend, who was another employee.  He 
had been warned in September 1997 by company officials to have no contact with her either at the office or outside the office; he knowingly 
violated the directive several times outside of work.  He had acknowledged to company officials that he knew that the former girlfriend was afraid 
of him.  (Answer; TR 30-33, 44-45, 52-53; Exhibits 4, 6)</P> 
 
<P> In April 1998 he was speeding and was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) after he had consumed six 
beers and drove to his former girl friend's (Girlfriend #2) apartment; he registered .14 and .09 on the BAC and was sentenced to sixty days in jail, 
suspended, fined $500, with $250 suspended plus $50 costs and ordered to enroll in an alcohol safety action program (ASAP), placed on 
probation for two years, and had his driver's license suspended for one year.  He completed the ASAP program in August 1998 with good to 
excellent performance.  In May 1998 and again in July 1998 Defense Contractor #3 submitted adverse information reports on the April 1998 DUI 
arrest and reported he violated a restraining order (the company later retracted the report that he had violated a restraining order), and also 
reported that he subsequently was convicted on all counts; he was reported to be on work release and had appealed his case.   (Answer; TR 32-34, 43-44; Exhibits 2, 5, 7, A)</P> 
 
<P> In April 1998 he was twice charged with Assault and Battery and Stalking this former girlfriend (Girlfriend #2); he pleaded guilty to all four 
counts, was sentenced to three years in jail, with two years suspended, and was able to continue his work through a work release program.  After 
he appealed in January 1999 he was found guilty of one count of Assault and Battery and the remaining charges were dismissed.  He was 
sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended for one year provided he was on good behavior; he paid $93 in court costs, and was ordered to have no 
direct or indirect contact with the victim; the court issued a Protective Order for one year.  (Answer; TR 35-39; Exhibits 2, 5, A)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was interviewed four times by Defense Security Service (DSS) investigators: once in 1994 and three times in the 1998-99 period and 
was always truthful.  (TR 45; Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 9) He sought counseling to help him recover from his last relationship and has not had any contact 
with any of these women since the April 1998 incidents.  He has not had any subsequent arrests nor subsequently violated any court protective 
orders.  He has no current girlfriend.  (TR 39-41, 45-47, 54, 59)</P> 
 
<P>In January 1998 Applicant consulted a licensed clinical social worker<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (Expert #1) to deal with his distress over his break-up with his Girlfriend 
#2.  Applicant continued to see him until January 1999; he recently saw this expert again.  The expert diagnosed him with situational adjustment 
disorder because of the stressful situation.  The therapist described Applicant's inability to empathize with the position of his partners as he was 
wrapped up in his own feelings; the therapy helped him understand the whole pattern of his behavior. Expert #1 could not predict whether this 
would recur as Applicant has not had another relationship but believes he is strong motivated to avoid this kind of situation and is doing much 
better.   (TR 58-59, 61-71)</P> 
 
<P>The vice-president of Defense Contractor #3 testified that Applicant is a supervisor who has been with the company since November 1997.  
Applicant's work is very good as he is a technically capable person and very conscientious.  While Applicant relates professionally to everyone in 
the office, in June 2001 Applicant was orally reprimanded, along with another employee, over an inappropriate  disagreement over how a job 
should be done.  Generally, his performance ratings are very good to outstanding.  (TR 73-77)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into 
conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to 
grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is 
not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth 
below :</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E</STRONG> <STRONG>- Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, co-workers, neighbors, and other acquaintances; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4)  Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging 
in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5)  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the 
agency; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1)  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>(2)  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  The criminal behavior was not recent</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in 
order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue 
an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In 
reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that 
have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P>       </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government advanced security concerns over personal conduct issues as Applicant's behavior<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> reflects questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard 
classified information.  Despite his ability to perform well in his professional capacities, Applicant has had repeated examples where he has 
demonstrated poor judgment and unreliability in his personal conduct - with his estranged wife in the 1993-94 period which led to his termination 
from Contractor #1.  He again demonstrated his poor judgment with a former girlfriend (Girlfriend #1) and her husband in the 1994 period after he 
was divorced.  Finally, Applicant again acted irresponsibly when he repeatedly harassed and stalked Girlfriend #2 after he terminated the 
relationship with her in September 1997.  This behavior led Contractor #2 to terminate him in November 1997 despite his otherwise excellent 
work performance.  Even after being hired by Contractor #3 Applicant continued to show poor judgment with respect to his actions in stalking and 
assaulting Girlfriend #2 and made a series of missteps in April 1998 which led to a DUI conviction and ultimately a conviction of Assault and 
Battery after he had successfully appealed his earlier guilty plea to four counts of battery and stalking.  </P> 
 
<P>While he has attended a court-ordered anger management program, his conduct nevertheless was not changed by these courses as he continued to 
re-offend.  Despite his excellent professional performance, his calamitous personal conduct raises grave doubts as to his reliability.  Notably, the 
court on appeal in 1999 issued another Protective Order against him for an additional year.  </P> 
 
<P>To rebut and overcome the Government's case, Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has mitigated<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> this past pattern.  Applicant has 
taken one positive step to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress in that from  January 1998-99, in that he 
sought therapy for his distress over his romantic difficulties.  The expert he saw reported that Applicant's conduct reflected his inability to 
empathize with the position of his partners as he was wrapped up in his own feelings.  While the therapy helped him to better understand the whole 
pattern of his behavior, Applicant has not again been involved with a woman, so the expert could not predict with certainty what Applicant's future 
personal conduct would be if he were disappointed in a romantic relationship.   His current professional excellence has to be measured against his 
termination from two previous defense contractors in 1994 and again in 1997 when his personal life seriously encroached on his professional 
conduct at work.  While not as serious, in June 2001,Applicant was orally reprimanded, along with another employee, over an inappropriate  
disagreement over how a job should be done.  Thus, doubt remains as to whether he is fully rehabilitated given this repeated pattern of rule 
violations in his personal life and given his long history of questionable conduct focused in the years 1993-98.  Given the seriousness and the 
repeated nature of his questionable conduct, he has not fully established that he would not re-engage in this conduct except for the dated incident in 
1980 where he used a fictitious telephone number to avoid payment, a pattern he has not repeated.  Hence, after considering the Appendix I 
Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a., but against Applicant on subparagraphs 
1.b.through 1.l. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government maintains security concerns over criminal conduct issues because of </SPAN>(<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1)  allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless 
of whether the person was formally charged; and </SPAN>(2) Applicant's multiple arrests and convictions as detailed in the Findings above and discussed 
under Personal Conduct.  </P> 
 
<P>While the 1980 arrest and conviction may be mitigated under condition (1) as the criminal behavior was not recent and as that incident was a 
misdemeanor, Applicant has presented insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation for the other repeated charges and convictions as discussed 
above.  Doubt remains as to whether he is fully rehabilitated given this repeated pattern of criminal conduct with three different women. While the 
charges filed by Girlfriend #1 were dismissed, he was convicted of criminal conduct against his estranged wife and Girlfriend #2.  This pattern was 
repeated and serious, and included violations of court restraining orders which led to jail time and orders to have no contact with the two victims.  
Indeed the 1998 conviction, after his guilty plea to four counts of Assault and Battery and Stalking, led to a sentence of three years<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> in jail with 
two years suspended.  He was only able to continue his work because of a work release program.  After he appealed this case, in January 1999 
he was found guilty of one count of Assault and Battery  and the remaining charges were dismissed.  The sentence was for sixty days in jail, 
suspended for one year provided that he be of good behavior for one year, pay court costs, and have no direct or indirect contact with the victim.  </P> 
 
<P>Thus, I conclude his other criminal conduct from 1993-1998 has not been mitigated<A HREF="01-08390.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">as it was recent, not isolated, and there is insufficient 
probability that his conduct would not recur despite his commendable act ion in seeking therapy, as discussed above</SPAN>, and in completing the ASAP 
program in August 1998 with good to excellent performance.  Further, he has not established clear evidence of rehabilitation as his criminal 
conduct in 1998 recurred even after completing a court ordered anger management.  Notably, the court on appeal in 1999 issued another 
Protective Order against him for an additional year.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. but against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.b.,1.c., 1.e, 1.f., 1.i., l.j., and 1.l. incorporated 
under SOR Paragraph 2.</P>

isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; 3.  The individual made prompt, 
good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts; 4.  Omission of material facts was caused or significantly 
contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided; 
5.  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress; 6.  A refusal to 
cooperate was based on advice from legal counsel or other officials that the individual was not required to comply with security processing

<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>  The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 mandated restrictions on the granting or renewal of security 
clearances which was implemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, Memorandum, and within DOHA by Operating 
Instruction (OI) 64, issued on July 10, 2001.  Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts with sentences 
imposed of more than one year, regardless of time actually served.  The policies apply to all pending cases in which a final decision had not been 
issued as of the June 7, 2001, date of the memorandum.  In this instance I have determined that the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Section 986) 
does not apply as the Applicant's 1998 sentence to more than one year was reversed on appeal in 1999 where he was sentenced to 60 days in 
jail, suspended.
