<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 24, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 24, 2006, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision should be reversed because the Judge improperly placed the burden of 
proving refutation, mitigation or extenuation of the government's security concerns upon the Applicant, even though the Applicant had not engaged in any 
misconduct.  He also contends the Judge improperly weighed the evidence.  In support of the latter contention, the Applicant essentially reargues his case, 
pointing to a number of favorable circumstances which Applicant believes the Judge should have found sufficient to overcome the government's security 
concerns.<A HREF="04-10340.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts that the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant 
admitted regarding his family and legal ties to Egypt, and the Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance 
decision. Directive &para; E3.1.15.  The Administrative Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate Applicant's 
past  and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met his burden of persuasion under Directive 
&para; Item E3.1.15. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all of the evidence presented.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 
4, 2001).  The fact that Applicant's explanations and his mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish error.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, 
the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  An applicant's 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying 
circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably 
applying any mitigating conditions or factors and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to 
overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines C 
and B is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
