<P>Applicant has a remaining overdue debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN> $13,000, which he is in the process of attempting to resolve. Since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> incurred this debt in 
1995 and 1996, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he</SPAN> has been and remains current on all of his other debts, and he has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has been shown.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 28</SPAN>, 2006 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>May 24, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations (RSOR), and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on </SPAN>June 16<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to the parties on June 29, 2006, and the hearing was held on July 18, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered 11 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 
A through K) and offered his own testimony. </SPAN>The record was held open until <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN> 15, 2006, to allow Department Counsel and Applicant to offer post hearing exhibits. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel 
submitted statutes from the Internal Revenue Code and excerpts from the IRS manual. This was marked as Exhibit 4. </SPAN>Applicant offered a series of letters and other  documents, which have been 
identified as Exhibit L.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on July 25, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contained four allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., 
under Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of evidence introduced during the hearing, the 
SOR was amended to add an additional allegation, 1.e. Applicant admitted this allegation as well. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 55 years old. He is married, and he has one daughter. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is employed as a Computer Technician by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the above debts, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was informed by the IRS that he owed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $56 for tax year 1997.  He paid $60, and has resolved that debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">testified</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that he timely filed a tax return for each of the years, 1992 through 1997, but these debts, 1.a. through 1.e., were assessed against him by the IRS, because he was 
not having enough withheld to pay the full amount of the tax. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of financial hardships he was only to make payments of $25 a month from June 2000 through May 2001, when he was advised by the IRS that his debts were considered uncollectible 
(Exhibit L).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has engaged the services of a tax attorney, and he is in the process of making a proposed a settlement to the IRS, where, if they accept,  he will pay </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $250 a week to resolve 
his debts, until they are no longer collectible because of the collection statute limitation date. At this time, until the IRS indicates the amount for tax years 1995 and 1996 that are no longer 
collectible,  I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> still owes the full amount of $13,023.48, as alleged under 1.d. and 1.e.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> initially became delinquent to the IRS in 1992, because as he stated, "the '90s were a little tough on me" (Tr at 27). In 1992 his wife divorced him, which resulted in him losing his home. 
In 1995, the company that he had worked for 18 years went out of business, and at the age of 45, his salary was reduced from $60,000 a year with significant benefits to $30,000 with fewer benefits.  
Six months previous to his losing his employment, he remarried, and two years later his wife  began to develop symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), which was ultimately diagnosed as full scale 
S.  His wife's income went from $30,000 annually to disability payments of $13,000 a year, and her medical bills were significant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also testified that because of his troubles from 1992 
through 1995, he was in an "an alcoholic fog", which he believes contributed to his lapse of judgement that resulted in his tax problems </SPAN>(Tr at 37, 39). In 1997 he successfully underwent a three 
month alcohol treatment program, and currently he rarely consumes alcohol.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the exception of the debt to the IRS of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $13,023.48, Applicant is current on all of his other debts. He has filed and paid his taxes on time since 1997. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> introduced two letters of recommendation from two individuals, a </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and an Educational Support Specialist, who know </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 
his professional setting. Both of them strongly recommended him for a position of trust and described him in extremely positive terms (Exhibit L). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties and overdue debts to the IRS. However, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> had a number of difficult 
problems that contributed to his financial difficulties; yet despite these difficulties, he always filed his tax returns and paid a significant amount to the IRS every year.  The evidence shows that 
Applicant has made<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a good faith effort to resolve his debt with the IRS, and at this time he owes to the IRS </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $13,000, which he should be able to resolve. All of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> other bills 
are current and he now exhibits responsible financial behavior. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN>under Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations 
and his inability to satisfy his debt to the IRS. However, I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. applies because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the behavior that resulted in Applicant's overdue debts to the IRS was 
last exhibited in 1997. MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.3.3. also applies </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">because Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> went through a number of problems including loss of employment and illness of his wife that were beyond his control. 
Finally, MC E2.A6.1.3.6. applies because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue debt to the IRS.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
