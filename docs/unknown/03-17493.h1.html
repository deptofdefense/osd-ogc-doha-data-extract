</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On June 4, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR details reasons why DOHA could not make the
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, of the Directive. DOHA
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On June 24, 2004, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations and requested waiver under Guideline J. He elected to have his case decided on
the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), and provided Applicant with a complete copy on August 10, 2005. Applicant had 30 days
from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an additional response and evidence on
August 23, 2005. This case was assigned to me on September 6, 2005.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In its brief, Department Counsel has advised that the government will not pursue the SOR allegation under Guideline J. As a result of the recent amendment to
10 U.S.C. § 986, this Disqualifying Condition will apply when an Applicant has been incarcerated for at least a year. Applicant served ten days in jail for his
third Driving While Intoxicated Offense (DWI), a felony under the applicable state law. The allegation of a security concern under Guideline J is therefore
found in favor of Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR with explanation.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of
fact.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old customer engineer for a defense contractor. Applicant has worked for this contractor or its predecessor for nine years. Applicant
completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in April 1996 and a supplemental statement in June 2003.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In November 1990, the police arrested and charged Applicant with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and criminal mischief.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The court found him guilty on
the DUI charge, sentenced him to 90 days in jail (suspended), placed him on probation for two years, fined him, and ordered him to participate in an alcohol
education program.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The court dismissed the criminal mischief charge.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In October 1995, the police arrested and charged Applicant with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), his second offense.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He plead guilty to the charge.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The
court sentenced him to thirty days in jail, allowing him to work under a work release program, fined him, assessed him court costs, and suspended his license
for one year.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In 1995, Applicant drank primarily on the weekends, usually 12 12-ounce beers.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He drank minimally during the week.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> From 1998 until July 1999, his
alcohol progressively increased.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He began drinking 6 12-ounce beers a day and significantly more on the weekends.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Although he does state why, in July
1999, Applicant stopped drinking "for the wrong reasons".<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In November 1999, he resumed drinking, increasing his daily intake of beer to 18 cans a day and
24 cans a day on the weekends.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<P>On March 18, 2000, the police arrested and charged Applicant with a third DWI offense, a felony under state law.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> On July 24, 2001, he plead guilty to the
charge.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The court sentenced him to ten years in jail (suspended), placed him on four years of probation, ordered 200 hours of community service, suspended
his license for one year, directed participation in a substance abuse program, and fined him.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant finished the community service requirements, paid his
fines, attended substance abuse counseling and completed his probationary period as required.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> He self-reported this incident to his employer.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Immediately after his third arrest and on his own initiative, Applicant sought counseling for his alcohol problem through a private alcohol counseling service
and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> He participated in counseling for six to eight months and in AA for six months.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> As a result of counseling, he
acknowledged that he is an alcoholic.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>He has abstained from alcohol use since March 17, 2000.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> He has continued to remain sober and his quality of life has
improved.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant returned to the counseling service in June 2004 for a complete evaluation of his alcohol addiction.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Based on the Addiction Severity Index and
SASSI-3 (Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory), the counseling service diagnosed him as alcohol dependent and noted that he had been in remission for
four years.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> The report noted his previous successful completion of two extensive treatment programs for alcohol dependency, which included individual and
group therapy.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> He actively participated in therapy, learning new skills, concepts and attitudes for addressing life problems.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> He accepted full responsibility for
the consequences of his alcohol use and addressed his alcohol problem.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> He demonstrated an understanding of how to identify problems which could lead to
alcohol use and the steps necessary to maintain sobriety.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> His risk for future problems resulting from drinking were deemed significantly lower.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant submitted two letters of recommendation from his supervisor, dated June 20, 2004 and August 22, 2005.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> Both letters praised his work performance
and the lifestyle changes he had made in the last five years.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> His supervisor also stated that at business functions and social events where alcohol is served, he
had observed Applicant requesting nonalcoholic beverages such as water, tea or cola to drink.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>He also submitted a letter, dated August 20, 2005, from his
current girlfriend, who stated that since September 2004, she had not known or observed him to drink alcohol on the many occasions they are together.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></P>

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case
against him.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be " in terms of the national
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="03-17493.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G. Based on all the evidence, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions E2.A7.1.2.1. (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>),
and E2.A7.1.2.5. (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>) apply in this case. In a period of ten years, the police arrested
and charged Applicant with three DUI/DWIs. During this same time period, his drinking increased from periodic weekend binges to excessive drinking on a
regular basis, causing impaired judgment, court convictions for DWI and jail time.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>I have considered all the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions and concluded that E2.A7.1.3.2. (<EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there
is no indication of a recent problem</EM>), and E2.A7.1.3.3. (<EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>) apply in this case. Applicant consumed his last
alcoholic drink more than five years ago. At that time, he recognized he  had a problem with alcohol. He immediately enrolled in a treatment and counseling
program which provided both individual and group therapy, and began attending AA meetings. He successfully completed the treatment programs, and
embraced the skills, attitudes and philosophies learned. He admitted that he is an alcoholic. He changed his attitude about alcohol, and thus, his lifestyle. He
developed a strong support group within his family and friends, and a plan to identity and manage potential problems which could lead to his resumption of
drinking. Because of theses changes, he has remained sober since March 17, 2000. His relationships with family and friends are greatly improved, and he
describes that last three years of his life as the best. His supervisor praised his work performance and supported his declaration that he no longer drinks.
Likewise, his girlfriend confirmed that when they are together, which is frequently, he does not drink. Applicant is rehabilitated and a recurrence of his conduct
is not likely. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am persuaded by the
totality of the evidence in this case, that Applicant has shown a significant change in his behavior following his active participation in alcohol counseling. He
stopped drinking. Through his active participation in the alcohol counseling program, he recognized that he had an alcohol problem, and assumed responsibility
for his conduct and alcohol use, which allowed him to create a new lifestyle away from alcohol. I conclude that Applicant has successfully mitigated and
overcome the government's case under Guideline G.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
