<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence as her elderly parents have lived in the U.S. since 1982 and have been permanent residents since 
1990.  While they have elderly relatives in Vietnam, they have no ties to the government.  She has limited or no contact with these elderly relatives and has not 
visited there since she left as a refugee in 1981.  She has no plans to return for a visit. It is improbable that foreign pressure on these relatives would create a 
situation that could influence Applicant as she persuasively attests that should any such pressure be exerted that she would report it to her security manager and 
government officials.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990 and has had a security clearance since 1997.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-27793.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to the Applicant on March 9, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.  The SOR alleges specific 
concerns over foreign influence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1. Applicant replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on March 26, 2004, where she 
denied 1.f. and admitted 1.a., 1.b, 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.g.  She requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who indicated it was ready to proceed on June 10, 2004.  On June 17, 2004, the case was assigned to me.  After a 
mutually convenient date for hearing was identified, a Notice of Hearing issued on June 22, 2004, set the matter for July12, 2004, at a location near where 
Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the Department Counsel offered  a Stipulation that the government's documents could be admitted without any 
objection from the Applicant.  Consequently, I accepted for Administrative Notice one document (AN I) (State Department Human Rights Report on Vietnam 
2000) and two exhibits (Exhibits 1-2; TR11).  The Applicant offered one exhibit (Exhibit A) which was admitted into evidence.  She testified herself.  The  
transcript (TR) was received on July 28, 2004.</P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of 
Fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a 33-year-old employee, began working for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 in October 1997.  Applicant was granted a secret 
clearance in December 1997; at that time she disclosed she had relatives in Vietnam.  In May 2002 she completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard 
Form 86) for a reinvestigation.  She went to work for Employer #2 in April 2004; she still needs a secret clearance.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 14)   (Exhibit 1; TR 14, 
17-18; 29-31)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born in Vietnam, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1990; she obtained a U.S. passport in August 1995.  She received a B.S. degree in 
electrical engineering in May 1995 at a university in State #1. Applicant married a U.S. citizen in November1998 in State 1.  Her husband works for the U.S. 
government and holds a U.S. Department of Energy "Q" clearance.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 17-18) All of her assets are in the U.S.: Applicant and her husband own 
a house in State #1 valued at $490,000 and she has a 401K.  (TR 19)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her parents are former refugees from Vietnam who left by boat when Applicant was eleven years old.  In August 1981 they were rescued and 
placed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong where they remained until 1982 when they were sponsored by a church group to come to the U.S.  They settled in State 
#1 where her father found a job as a photographer until he retired in 2000.  (Exhibit 2; TR 15, 20, 22; 27)  When Applicant completed the SF 86 forms, she 
disclosed that her parents are citizens of Vietnam, but her parents currently resides in the U.S. in State #1 and became permanent U.S. residents in 1990; they do 
not hold a passport from Vietnam.  (Exhibit 1; Answer; TR 15, 23)   Her paternal grandfather had worked for the French.  Her father had a photography 
business in Vietnam.  Neither her mother or father were affiliated in any way with the Vietnamese communist party, government, or military.   Her parents have 
not had any contact with the Vietnamese government since their arrived in the U.S. in 1982, but they have not become U.S. citizens because of the language 
barrier and because of their difficulty in learning American history.   They are still studying for the test.  They have no intent to return to Vietnam.  (Exhibit 2; 
TR 20-21; 29, 32, 36)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her parents call their relatives in Vietnam three times a year.  For six years she provided financial support of $2,000 to her parents.  She learned that they have  
used it on an intermittent basis to help relatives in Vietnam.  Her parents sent clothes or divided the money and had it delivered personally by their friends.  She 
has not provided any money for the past 18 months once she learned it was a security concern.  (Exhibit 2, page 3; TR 16-17, 21) She has no future intent to 
provide any money to anyone in Vietnam. (TR 26)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has several other relatives who are citizens of Vietnam and reside in Vietnam.  In 1982 after Applicant and her parents fled the Government of 
Vietnam took control of her uncle's family photo business and forced him to retire.  Since then the communist government has taken no action against her 
family in Vietnam.  She has no recent contact with her father's relatives in Vietnam.  She has not had any contact since 1980 with her paternal uncle in his mid-70's who is a retired photographer nor with her paternal aunts who are in their 70's who had husbands who were photographers.   She has had yearly telephone 
contact of five to ten minutes with her maternal aunt who is 70 and a housewife; her husband was a construction worker.  She has fifteen cousins but only 
knows two of them; she has not communicated with them in 23 years.  None of her relatives have worked for the Government of Vietnam.  None are members 
of the communist party in Vietnam. (Exhibit 2; TR 15-16, 23-25; 27-29)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attests she will not be pressured or influenced by any foreign power or by her foreign relatives; if there was any effort to pressure or coerce her into 
disclosing classified information she would immediately report it to her security manager or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  She has not visited 
Vietnam since she left and has no plans to return or visit. (Exhibit 2, pages 4-5)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was recommended for a security clearance by three professional colleagues.  (Exhibit A; TR 12)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A program manager who has known her since 1997 states that she is an excellent performer and very professional.  She has a sense of "love and gratitude for 
her adopted country, and recognition of what her freedoms are worth."  He stated she is an excellent security risk.   (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A staff systems engineer who is a professional colleague who has known her for seven years attests that Applicant's work conduct and professionalism have 
always been exceptional.  He has observed that she is "someone you can trust."  (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A corporate engineering manager recommended her for a security clearance.  He has known her for six years as her colleague, manager and friend.  She has 
handled her responsibilities "with high integrity and professionalism" (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.      A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had a security clearance since 1997.  She mitigated the Government's security concerns over possible foreign influence raised by Applicant's 
close ties of affection to her elderly parents who are citizens of Vietnam but who have resided n the U.S. since 1982 and over her parents relatives with whom 
she has no contact or very limited contact.  She overcame the security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that a security risk may exist when an 
individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While I have considered these concerns and the documents submitted for administrative notice, I conclude Applicant has presented evidence to meet the burden 
these circumstances present.  These security concerns are mitigated by several facts: Applicant's parents have lived in the U.S. since 1982 and have been 
permanent residents of the U.S. since 1990.  They are in the process of applying to become naturalized citizens. Applicant's only family ties to Vietnam are her 
elderly relatives with whom she has limited or no contact since 1981; she has no contact with her cousins.  She has not visited Vietnam since she left as a 
refugee in 1981.  Thus, any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or her immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, should any duress be attempted, Applicant credibly stated she would report such an attempt to her security officer or the FBI.  In addition, she has 
references from three professional colleagues and supervisors who endorse her trustworthiness for a security clearance.  Thus, I find  there is no substantial 
likelihood that she would be subject to duress merely because of these family ties as the family have no ties to the government.  It is unlikely they or she could 
be exploited by  the government in Vietnam in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to those relatives and  loyalty to the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While for six years she provided money to her parents who in turn used it to help relatives in Vietnam, she no longer provides such money to her parents and 
has not done so for eighteen months since she learned to do so could raise a security concern.  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security 
determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  After 
considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of 
undue pressure on Applicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. in 
Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
