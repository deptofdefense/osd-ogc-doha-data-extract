<P>Although Applicant promised in 2002 to resolve his debts, he only resolved some of them and developed no plan to pay or resolve the majority of the 
delinquent debts reported on his credit reports.  While he disputed or questioned several debts, he did not provide any evidence to support a contention that he

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>APPEAL AND REMAND ORDER</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>On March 3, 2006, the Director of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded the Case Record and the Appeal Board Decision of March 
3, 2006, concerning a unfavorable security clearance decision issued November 23, 2005.  The Statement of Reasons (SOR) issued to the Applicant on August 
17, 2004, alleged specific concerns over finances (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  On appeal Applicant challenged both the Guideline F and 
Guideline E issues.  The Board concluded that they could not address any of the issues raised by Applicant as on page 2 of the decision:</P> 
<P>. . .there is red ink across certain words in the Judge's findings of fact.  The red ink leads the Board to doubt whether it knows with confidence what the Judge 
found with respect to Applicant's description of his financial situation on his security clearance application. In light of the ambiguity, the Board remands the 
case for the Judge to issue a <EM>clean</EM> decision which is unambiguous in its findings. (Emphasis added)</P> 
<P>Appeal Board Decision (March 3, 2006) at 2.  The red ink that caused the ambiguity for the Board was a line deleting two words "of his": thus, the corrected 
sentence should have read ". . .he failed to disclose any [deleted words] financial delinquency issues in response to questions 38 or 39."  While he had admitted 
this allegation in his answer, he had, in fact, disclosed three delinquencies in response to Question 38, so the decision is amended to reflect that correction.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  
Applicant answered the SOR on September 22, 2004.  He admitted all the allegations under Guidelines F and E and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On April 8, 2005, Department Counsel signed a Ready to Proceed notice and on April 22, 2005, the matter was assigned to me.  A May 11, 2005, Notice of 
Hearing set the matter for May 24, 2005.  Department Counsel offered six documents that were admitted into evidence; Applicant objected to Exhibit 4 as not 
recent, but his objection was overruled as the document remained relevant as documenting his credit history.  (TR 13)  Applicant represented himself and 
testified; he offered one exhibit (Exhibit A) which was admitted into evidence without objection.  He requested additional time to submit evidence; I granted 
him two weeks until June 8, 2005, to submit any additional documents.  (TR 40-42, 53)  On June 8, 2005, Applicant  submitted additional evidence which was 
admitted into evidence as Exhibit B as on June 9, 2005, the government forwarded it and indicated no objection.  The transcript (TR) was received on June 2, 
2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant is a 45-year-old network operations manager employed by a defense contractor in State #1 from 1984 to present.  Previously, he was granted a Secret 
clearance in July 1987. (Exhibit 1; TR 22)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant studied at a community college in State #1 from 1977-79.  He also attended college in State #2 from 1979 to 1981.  He was married in 1999 and 
divorced in August 2004.   His former wife remains in the family home.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 22; 25-26)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Finances and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">When Applicant completed his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 16, 2001, he failed to disclose any financial delinquency issues in response 
to Question 39 regarding 90 day financial delinquencies, and gave an incomplete answer  in response to Question 38 concerning 180 day delinquencies as he 
disclosed his financial problems with only three creditors.  In his Answer he admitted that he intended to falsify material facts in his answers to Questions 38 
and 39 on his SF 86.  (Answer, Exhibit 1) (SOR 2.a.)   While he did not testify as to whether or not he intended to falsify, Applicant declared in his closing 
argument that he had no intent "to mislead" by his answers in the SF 86 as he answered to the best of his ability.  (TR52)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">When questioned by the Defense Security Service (DSS) about his finances in January 2002, he stated that in 1993 or 1994 he was in an accident where he was 
sued and a judgment was issued against him for $4,000 as he was uninsured.  While initially he paid $200 a monthly on a payment plan, he still owed $3,000 in 
2002.  After his father became ill in 1996 and required a great deal of care, Applicant assumed some of his father's medical bills as his other siblings were 
unable to help.  Applicant subsequently "fell behind" on his own bills.  His father died in 1999, and Applicant paid the funeral expenses.  Then in 1996 
Applicant had his own health problems which led to further financial issues.  After he married in 1999, they put all of their efforts into cleaning up his wife's 
credit so they could buy a house.  In 2002 he reported that he and his wife had net monthly income of $6,546, expenses of $2,521, and monthly debts of $3,043.  
He had a net remainder of $982 monthly with assets of $167,100 including real estate, savings, investments and cars. In January 2002, he declared he planned to 
make arrangements to resolve debts to his creditors. For example, he agreed to set up a payment plan to pay $236 per month to pay a balance of $2,482 to a 
collection agency for a bank account.  Now that they are divorced, his former wife remains in the home they purchased after focusing on her credit issues.  
(Exhibits 2, 6; TR 18-19; 23) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In October 2003 he stated he had paid two judgments in full, but he did not provide documentation. He had recent health problems, including surgery in June 
2003.  He returned to work full-time in December 2004.  Most of his medical bills were covered by his health insurance.  (Exhibit 3; TR 19; 23-24)  Recently, 
he contacted a credit counseling bureau and stated he was in the process of completing the forms they required; however, he provided no evidence he completed 
the process.  He was able to get credit to purchase two cars and has credit cards. (TR 20-22)  He purchased in 2003 a 2000 Mercury Sable for $5,500 and in 
2004 a Lincoln LS for $34,000.  (TR 31-34)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The SOR alleges delinquent debts which total approximately $18,000:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.a. to Creditor #1 for $376 was charged off as a bad debt in 1997 and has not been paid.  (Exhibits 4, 5, 6; TR 27) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.b. to Creditor #2 for $647 was charged off as a bad debt in 1997; in his DSS statement in January 2002, Applicant declared he had paid this bill which 
I accept as paid without his documentation.  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6; TR 27) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Applicant claimed no knowledge of debt 1.c. to Creditor #3 for $3,352 or Debt 1.d. for $2,564 to Creditor 3; however, the first debt was placed for collection 
in 1997 and the second debt was placed for collection in 1998.  Applicant neither disputed nor paid this debt. (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6; TR 27-28) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.e. to Creditor #4 for $722 was to a department store and was charged off as a bad debt in March 1998 and has not been paid.  (Exhibits 4, 5, 6; TR 28) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Initially in 2002, Applicant said he did not recognize debt 1.f. to Creditor #5 for $4,945 for a judgment entered in July 1998; however, later he stated it was 
satisfied  through wage garnishments in 2002 which I accept as paid without his documentation.  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6; TR 28, 30-31)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Applicant said he thought he had paid this judgment in January 2001, the debt 1.g. to Creditor #6 for $1,104 for a judgment entered against him in August 
1998 for a personal loan. However, he provided no evidence that the debt has been satisfied.  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6; TR 29) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Initially, in 2002 Applicant claimed no knowledge of debt 1.h. to Creditor #7 for $55 which was placed for collection in 2000 for a mobile phone; 
subsequently, he said he had paid this bill but had no documentation. (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6; TR 29) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.i. to Creditor #8 for $3,555.709 was an account placed for collection in 2000 and has not been satisfied.   (Exhibits 4, 5, 6; TR 29-30) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.j. to Creditor #9 for $616 was an account placed for collection. He paid $717 to this creditor in June 2005. (Exhibits 4, 5, 6; TR 30)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Debt 1.k. to Creditor #10 for $84 was placed for collection in 2004.  He paid this $84 debt in June 2005.  (Exhibits 4, 5, 6; TR 27) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">At the time of the hearing, he had not set up a payment plan with any of these creditors, nor had he sought credit counseling.  He currently makes $71,000 per 
year.  (TR 36-40) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In June 2005 he stated he would develop a plan to pay several of his creditors, but provided no information on such a plan.  He only provided proof of paying 
debts in 1.j and 1.k.  (Exhibit B) In June 2005 his monthly income was $3,772 and his monthly expenses were $2,895, including a $785 payment for his Lincoln 
and a $186 payment for his Mercury.  (Exhibit B)</SPAN></P>

meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.  "The adjudicative process is an 
examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."  An administrative 
judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person.<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "Any

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Financial Considerations<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline F as Applicant's delinquent debts falls within Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions E2.6.1.2.1 
(<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant had multiple debts which became 
delinquent and several remain unpaid.  Beginning in 1997 he began to "fall behind" on several of his accounts due to his and his father's health problems.  
However, even after his father's death in 1999, he was unable to address and resolve his debts.  Later Applicant had his own health problems, but he returned to 
work full time in December 2004.  </P> 
<P>While he claimed no knowledge of some of these debts, he has resolved only a few of the debts even though he was put on notice by his DSS interview in 2002 
that these debts raised a security concern.  He was again put on notice in 2003 when he was sent Interrogatories, but took no action to resolve his debts.  He was 
again put on notice in 2004 when he was sent the SOR, but again took no action to resolve his debts.  Even after his hearing in 2005, he resolved only two of 
the smaller debts (1.j. and 1.k.) that had continued to raise security concerns.  Thus, he has not demonstrated responsibility in addressing a majority of his debts.  
Further, he did not show he had challenged the accuracy of these credit reporting agencies on any of these questioned debts.  </P> 
<P>The Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (MC) to consider for Applicant are E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g.; loss of employment . . . </EM>)) Certainly, Applicant and his father's health problems over the past decade contributed to his 
financial stresses.  However, he made a substantial income and instead of using that income to resolve his debts or seeking financial counseling, he chose to 
purchase two automobiles.  Currently, his car payments total $971 monthly. </P> 
<P>Although Applicant has resolved some of his smaller debts (1.b., 1.f., 1.h., 1.j, and 1.k.), overall he failed to demonstrate that he falls within MC E2.A6.1.3.6 
(<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>), as half of his debts remain unresolved.  Applicant stated in 
2002 that he would identify all these creditors and resolve the matter, but failed to do so.  While he currently lives within his means, he failed to resolve over 
$11,000 in debts that linger from the 1997 to 2000 period.  While Applicant documented some health problems, he did not show how those expenses adversely 
and materially affected his ability to resolve this indebtedness.  </P> 
<P>While he questioned several debts, he did not provide any evidence to dispute any of the debts either to the creditors or at the hearing.  These debts were 
documented on several credit reports.  Under the circumstances, Applicant failed to initiate a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve this indebtedness. </P> 
<P>In addition, I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  In considering the "whole person" concept, I have taken into 
consideration that Applicant has taken some steps to resolve his indebtedness and has favorable references, but that is offset by his failure to seek counseling to 
resolve his lingering financial problems.  While Applicant has a long history with his employer, Applicant presented insufficient information to explain why he 
has taken no action over the past three years to resolve the remainder of his debts.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate security concerns over SOR 
allegations 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e.,1.g, and 1.i.  Consequently,  because of these persistent financial concerns, Applicant is not eligible for access to classified 
information.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The government established its concerns under Guideline E as Applicant's  answer to Questions 38 and 39 on the 2001 security clearance application pertaining 
to financial delinquencies was deliberately misleading.  His deliberate omissions of his many financial delinquencies raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations. . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . </EM>).  A finding of 
falsification requires evidence that the Applicant acted with an intent to mislead or deceive the government.  The record evidence as a whole must be 
considered to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning Applicant's state of mind at the time the statement was made.  Applicant 
admitted in his Answer that he falsified material fact by his omissions.  Thus,  I conclude Applicant did deliberately, with an intent to deceive, answer questions 
38 and 39 inaccurately.  </P> 
<P>While he argued in his closing that he had not meant to mislead, he also acknowledged that he knew he was in debt which he failed to disclose fully on his SF 
86.  Applicant failed to offer sufficient mitigating<A HREF="02-28915.h2.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> evidence to establish that he had no intent to mislead by these many omissions.  For example, he provided 
no evidence that he made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts at the DSS interview. In addition, I 
carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  While he has many favorable references which praise his dedication, 
loyalty, and responsibility, they did not address his reputation for honesty.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate security concerns over SOR 
allegations 2.a.. Consequently, because of these personal conduct concerns, Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
