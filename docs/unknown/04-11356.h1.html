<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2003, Applicant submitted a SF 86 in which he deliberately failed to disclose that between 1993 and 1998 he sold drugs for profit and was arrested and 
charged five times for drug-related offenses. On one of those occasions, he was convicted and placed on probation. He failed to mitigate the personal conduct 
and criminal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 16, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the 
government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his access to 
classified information.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On August 27, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer). He admitted (with explanations) the underlying facts of the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a.(1), 
1.b.(1), and 1.c; denied that he deliberately falsified his SF 86;<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and requested a hearing. He failed to answer the allegation in subparagraph 2.a, and I considered 
the allegation denied. The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2005. On November 8, 2005, I convened a hearing at which the government presented five 
exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support the SOR.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant testified and presented two exhibits that were admitted without objection and marked AE 1-2. DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on December 1, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">partial admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the 
following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 28 years old, has never been married, and is the father of two children: a fifteen -year-old boy and a four-year-old girl. Applicant graduated from 
high school in June 1997. In 1999, he began working as a voice and data cable installer. He has been working in that capacity for a defense contractor since 
November 2002, and requires a clearance to access his job sites. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since birth, Applicant lived with his maternal grandparents, who financially supported him and his mother. In 1993, his grandfather became very ill, was not 
able to work, and developed financial difficulties. Applicant began to illegally sell cocaine and crack cocaine to generate income and provide financial support 
for his grandparents and his mother, who was then receiving welfare. He was 16 years old. Applicant's grandfather died in 1995. Applicant continued to sell 
drugs until at least 1998 to support his son (born in 1994) and his mother, as well as to prevent the foreclosure of his grandfather's home mortgage. His income 
from the sale of drugs was between $200 and $500 a week. Applicant also used marijuana, at least twice, between June and December 1996. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1993 to 1998, Applicant was arrested five times for drug related offenses (possession of controlled substances (cocaine/crack cocaine) and possession 
with the intent to distribute controlled substances). On four of those occasions, the charges were dismissed. On one occasion, he was convicted and placed on 
probation for six months. He was charged with assault after a woman filed charges against him when he attempted to collect drug money from her. Applicant 
was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident with injuries and failing to have a drivers license. He had borrowed a friend's car and was involved in an 
accident. When questioned by police officers, he attempted to mislead the officers by using a friend's identity since he did not have a driver's license.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stopped selling drugs around 1998 when he realized he was setting the wrong example for his son. He claimed he has not used marijuana since 1996.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
He lives in his late grandfather's home, located in the same neighborhood where he used to sell drugs. He claims, however, he no longer associates with other 
drug users, including those who purchased their drugs from him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in which he answered "NO" to question number 24, which asked whether he had 
ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant failed to disclose that between 1993 and 1998, he had been charged 
five times for possession of cocaine-crack cocaine and/or possession of controlled substances with the intent to distribute. More importantly, he failed to 
disclose that, on one of those occasions, he was convicted of a drug related offense and placed on probation for six months. Additionally, he answered "NO" to 
question number 29, which inquired about his use of illegal drugs and drug activity (purchase, sale, and trafficking) within the last seven years.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He failed to 
disclose he had sold cocaine and crack cocaine for profit from about 1993 to at least 1998. Applicant also failed to disclose he had lied to police officers during 
a traffic stop subsequent to a traffic accident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant claimed he was confused by SF 86 question 24 and made the mistake of believing he was required to disclose only those charges or 
convictions that fell within the last seven years. He also claimed he made the mistake of believing he was required to disclose only alcohol and drug related 
convictions and failed to disclose that he was charged with such offenses. He averred he never intended to falsify his answers or to deceive the government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding question 29, Applicant claimed he did not disclose his drug use/activity because he thought his drug use and drug activity fell outside of the seven 
year period covered by the question. He explained that when he provided his two statements to the defense investigators, he was not sure of the period of time 
covered by his drug use and drug activity and  gave the investigators his best estimate. Applicant admitted he exercised poor judgment when answering SF 86 
questions 24 and 29.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant expressed remorse for dealing drugs and what he called "his childish and foolish" behavior for thinking he could support his family 
by selling drugs. He claimed he has not used marijuana since 1996, and has not purchased or sold drugs since around 1998. Applicant has dedicated his life to 
setting a good example for his children, his work, and participating in church activities. He is living with a woman who is carrying his child and they expect to 
be married in the near future. Applicant testified he has matured and knows what he did is wrong and does not intend to use or sell drugs ever again. There is no 
evidence he has been involved in any additional drug related misconduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented two reference letters from friends that characterized him as a church-going and trusted friend. They affirmed he has matured and is now a 
reliable friend and loving father.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified 
information. The administrative judge most take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of the case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber9"></A>impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive,<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against 
an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance 
governing the granting or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> for an applicant to either receive or continue 
to have access to classified information. The government has the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's 
case. Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information 
enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each 
applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly 
consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in 
favor of protecting national security.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate question - whether a person's past conduct instills 
confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government established its case under Guideline E by showing that Applicant deliberately falsified his SF 86. He was arrested and charged with possession 
and/or possession of drugs with intent to distribute at least five times. On one of those occasions, he was convicted and received six months' probation. Further, 
he sold drugs for profit from 1993 to at least 1998. Applicant chose not to disclose these facts and behavior, seemingly, because of his concern for the adverse 
impact this information would have had on his qualifications to obtain a security clearance. Applicant's explanations for his failure to disclose the information 
ring hollow in light of the totality of the facts and circumstances, including his age at the time he submitted the SF 86, his demeanor, and his prior statements.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
I find Applicant's omissions were knowing and deliberate, and omitted with the intent to mislead the government. Additionally, Applicant used an alias to 
mislead police officers after being involved in a traffic accident. Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). A history or pattern of criminal conduct is a security concern because it may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules and 
regulations and may show the applicant to be lacking in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Despite Applicant's claims to the contrary, I conclude the 
government established its case under Guideline J by showing that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant deliberately provided false answers when he submitted his SF 86 in February 
2003. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or knowingly make or

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was 26 years old at the time he submitted the SF 86. In light of his past behavior - i.e., selling drugs on the streets for a profit and his run-ins with the 
law - his falsifications cannot be attributed to youthful exuberance, foolishness, or stupidity. He deserves credit for changing his lifestyle, for his concerns 
regarding the welfare of his children, and for his desire to set a good example for them. Notwithstanding, his current behavior is not sufficient to mitigate the 
security concerns raised by his falsifications. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have considered all the Personal Conduct<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and Criminal Conduct<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Mitigating Conditions, and find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">none 
apply. In light of all the facts and circumstances, I conclude Applicant's falsifications are relatively recent and that the motive that led him to falsify the SF 86 - 
i.e., his desire to cover up his drug use and drug related behavior - remains a viable factor that could influence Applicant's future behavior. I also find 
Applicant's evidence was not sufficient to clearly establish that he has been successfully rehabilitated. As such, he is likely susceptible to influence, pressure, or 
coercion to cover up his past behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative 
guidelines. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-11356.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> of the record before me reflects a young man who is not fully attuned to what the government expects of 
persons it trusts with access to sensitive information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's 
testimony, the circumstances that caused his misconduct, the whole person concept, and the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, I find Applicant has not 
mitigated this security concerns. Guideline E and Guideline J are decided against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
