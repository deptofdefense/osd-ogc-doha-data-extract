<P>Security concerns raised by Applicant's birth in Yugoslavia 28 years ago, by his possessing a foreign passport, by his exercise of dual citizenship, and by the 
Yugoslavian citizenship of his<STRONG> </STRONG>parents and members of his extended family are mitigated by evidence Applicant used his Yugoslavian passport before

is now employed by a U.S. company. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 19, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>," dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, "<EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA   could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether he should be granted a security clearance.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 12, 2002, and stated he wanted his case decided without a hearing.  Applicant received his File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) consisting of  seven items on April 29, 2002.  He filed his response on May 20, 2002.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on 
June 4, 2002.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">AMENDMENT OF STATEMENT OF REASONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After receiving Applicant's answer to the SOR, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the date when Applicant became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen from "1988" to "1998" and by changing the residence of Applicant's parents from Yugoslavia to the United States.  Because the amendments 
Department Counsel has proposed incorporate information from Applicant's answer and bring existing allegations into conformance with the evidence, the 
motion to amend is granted.  Under the circumstances, no purpose would be served by granting either party additional time for further preparation or for other 
good cause (See Paragraph E3.1.17., DoD Directive 5220.6).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleges a security concern is raised by Applicant's dual citizenship (United States and Yugoslavia), by his holding, and 
intending to renew his Yugoslavian passport, by the Yugoslavian citizenship and residence of his parents, by his close relatives who reside in and are citizens of 
Yugoslavia or Germany, and by his failure to acknowledge that he was/is a dual citizen on the SF 86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions) he 
completed on September 23, 1999.</P> 
<P>In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted using his Yugoslavian passport before becoming a U.S. citizen (in 1999) and holding that passport until it expired 
in July 2001, and he admitted having relatives who reside in and are citizens of Germany and Yugoslavia. Applicant denied being a dual citizen; he denied his 
parents were Yugoslavian citizens who reside in Yugoslavia (they are Yugoslavian citizens but have resided in the United States since 1984), and he denied 
falsifying any information on his SF 86.</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of Applicant's admissions and denials and the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in Yugoslavia 28 years ago. In 1984, when Applicant was ten years old, his parents moved to the United States (on a G4 Visa) as a 
consequence of his father's employment.<A HREF="02-00317.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant and his parents have lived in the United States continuously since that time.  Members of Applicant's 
extended family have continued to reside in Yugoslavia and in Germany; none are identified as being employed by their respective governments. Applicant 
graduated from high school, graduated from college in 1996, and received his Master's degree in 1997--all from American educational institutions. Applicant 
began working for his current employer, a DoD contractor, in January 1997.  He applied for and was issued a Yugoslavian passport on July 30, 1997. He 
became a U.S. citizen in November 1998. He has not previously applied for a security clearance.</P> 
<P>When Applicant completed the SF 86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions) in September 1999, he certified:</P> 
<P>My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.</P> 
<P>after answering "no" to the question: "Are you now or were you a dual citizen of the U.S. and another country<A HREF="02-00317.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>?" On the same questionnaire, Applicant 
provided accurate and complete information about his birthplace, his holding a Yugoslavian passport<A HREF="02-00317.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, his parent's birthplace and their current citizenship, and 
the date of his naturalization to become a U.S. citizen.</P> 
<P>In his first signed, sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS) on April 11, 2001, Applicant disclosed:</P> 
<P>I currently have an active Yugoslavian and US passports. I keep the Yugoslavian passport for when I  to travel to Yugoslavia to visit my family. Using a 
Yugoslavian passport simplifies the travel arrangements - i.e. no visa requirements. I plan to renew by passport when it expires to use for this purpose again. 
Since I was born in Yugoslavia, the country will consider me as a citizen for life.  I use my US passport for all other travels.</P> 
<P>When he was questioned by DSS a second time (Item #5) about his citizenship status and his answer to question 3 (above), Applicant explained:</P> 
<P>On the initial Security Clearance Form, I have answered "NO" when asked if I have dual citizenship. At that time, I considered myself a US citizen only.  Only 
after several conversations with my parents I was made aware that since I was born in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia technically considers me a citizen for life. Even 
though I have obtained a US citizenship, Yugoslavia will still consider me a Yugoslavian citizen.</P> 
<P>Later in answering the specific allegations on the SOR, Applicant denied dual citizenship and  explained:</P> 
<P>I am not sure about what the international law states regarding dual citizenship. However, I have been living in the U.S. since August 1984. Foremost, I 
consider myself a citizen of the U.S. only, and I have no intention of living anywhere else but in the U.S.</P> 
<P>He also denied using his Yugoslavian passport after he became a U.S. citizen:</P> 
<P>The last time I used my Yugoslavian passport was between 08/14 - 98/23, 1997 to travel on vacation to St. Christopher and Nevis. Since I was not a U.S. 
Citizen at that time, I had no choice but to use my Yugoslavian passport. I became a U.S. citizen on November 24, 1998 and I have <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> used my Yugoslavian 
passport since the above mentioned trip to St. Christopher and Nevis. I have received my U.S. passport on 07/20.1999 (Passport ID: ----------) For all my travels 
since the naturalization date, I used my U.S. passport only........</P> 
<P>My Yugoslavian passport expired 07/30/2001. I <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">no</SPAN> longer plan to renew my Yugoslavian passport. I plan to use my U.S. passport solely from now on for all 
travels.</P> 
<P>Applicant provided yet more explanatory information in his May 20, 2002 response to the FORM.  To corroborate his assertion--in answer to the SOR--that 
he had not used his Yugoslavian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, he provided a copy of his expired Yugoslavian passport, showing no travel since the 
August 1997 trip noted above. His parents are now permanent residents of the U.S. and are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship in May 2003.  The status of his 
father's employer has changed; it is now a U.S. corporation.  Applicant also stated that before completing his answer to question 3 (Item #4), he discussed the 
matter with his employer's security officer after providing him with all of the information about his background. Applicant purchased his own home in April 
2001; and stated he planned to live in the U.S. "for the rest of my life."</P> 
<P>No evidence has been provided on the quality of Applicant's duty performance.</P>

<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case by 
case basis with an eye toward making decisions with reasonable consistency which are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making these 
overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze these overall common sense determinations, Administrative 
Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, 
but also in the context of factors set forth in Section E2.2. of the Directive.  In that vein, the Government not only has the burden of proving any controverted 
fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P> 
<P>The following Adjudicative guidelines apply to this case:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FOREIGN INFLUENCE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN>(Guideline B)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>The Concern: </STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection of obligation, is a citizen of or resident or present, in 
a foreign country.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate a security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FOREIGN PREFERENCE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN>(Guideline C)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>The Concern:</STRONG> When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></P> 
<P>E2.A3.1.2.1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</P>

<P>E2.A3.1.3.4. Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN>(Guideline E)</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>The Concern: </STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.3.1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government has established its case, the burden 
of persuasion shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualifying conduct and 
demonstrates it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P> 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  When the facts 
proven by the Government raise doubt about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate 
he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly 
consistent standard indicates security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." As this Administrative Judge understands the 
Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an Applicant.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Having considered the record evidence in accordance with appropriate legal precepts and factors, this Administrative Judge concludes the Government has 
established its case with regard to Guidelines C and E.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as whole, including each of the factors 
enumerated in Section 6.3, as well as those referred to in Section E2.2. dealing with adjudicative process, both in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant's dual citizenship, his use of a Yugoslavian passport, and his stated intention--in an April 2001 signed, sworn statement--to renew his Yugoslavian 
passport raise a security concern under Guideline C. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
<P>A careful review of Applicant's actions which have been cited as indicating a possible foreign preference and his subsequent statements explaining those 
actions, suggest there is less significance to these actions than is alleged in the SOR.  He acted out of necessity when he used his Yugoslavian passport for 
foreign travel in 1997. At the time of this travel, he did not have a U.S. passport as he was not yet a U.S. citizen. If he wanted to travel outside the United States, 
he had to travel on a passport issued by his native country. Under the circumstances, his use of his Yugoslavian passport was a necessity, not an indication of 
preference for that country. When he stated his intention to renew his Yugoslavian passport, he obviously did not realize the implications of carrying a foreign 
passport; he did not realize applying for and carrying a foreign passport was an affirmation of his Yugoslavian citizenship. It is quite apparent from his 
statement (Item #4) that he looked upon his Yugoslavian passport as little more than a piece of paper that facilitated travel to the country of his birth; since he 
had been born in Yugoslavia and was eligible to receive and carry a passport from that country, he intended to exercise that privilege. As soon as Applicant 
learned carrying a foreign passport and exercising dual citizenship impacted his security clearance suitability and possibly his employment, he was not 
interested in renewing his Yugoslavian passport. He did not express any interest in renewing his passport for sentimental reasons, or because Yugoslavia is the 
country of his birth and the country of his parent's citizenship.</P> 
<P>While Applicant has not specifically renounced his Yugoslavian citizenship, the intention to do so is implicit in his statements that he intends to live in the U.S. 
for the rest of his life. He has lived in the United States for 18 years; he has received all of his professional education and most of his primary education in this 
country. He has acquired a profession in the United States and is employed in that profession. He has purchased real estate. That he stands to inherit a small 
piece of real estate (from his parents) in Yugoslavia does not establish a preference.  The value of this property is much less than the value of the property he 
owns in the United States. It cannot go unsaid the country of Applicant's birth, the country that was once Yugoslavia, has been torn apart by ethic wars for 
much of the past ten years. Under these circumstances, it is understandable why Applicant does not harbor any deep seated attachment to the country of his 
birth. Guideline C is concluded for Applicant.</P> 
<P>The Yugoslavian citizenship of Applicant's parents and the foreign citizenship of members of his extended family raise a security concern under Guideline B. A 
security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence or obligation are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.</P> 
<P>The security concern raised by the Yugoslavian citizenship of Applicant's parents is mitigated by their current, permanent resident status (in the U.S.), and by 
their residing in the United States continuously for 18 years. Moreover, the employer for whom Applicant's father has worked since arriving in the United 
States is now a U.S. company. It is unlikely either of his parents would be subject to duress because of their foreign citizenship. Although members of 
Applicant's extended family continue to reside in Yugoslavia and Germany, Applicant has minimal contact with them and none of these individuals are 
identified as being employed by their respective governments, or as being in a position where they are likely to experience duress. Guideline B is concluded for 
Applicant.</P> 
<P>The Government has not established its case with respect to Guideline E. While Applicant  answered "no" to the SF 86 question that asked if he had been, or 
was currently a dual citizen of the U.S. and another country, when the correct answer to that question, was clearly "yes", the evidence does not establish his 
"no" answer was made with the intention of deliberately falsifying material information. Applicant answered truthfully all other questions on the SF 86 
designed to elicit information about his citizenship and background. In answer to other questions on the same form, Applicant disclosed he had been born in 
Yugoslavia and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 1998, that he had a current, valid Yugoslavian passport, that his parents had been born in 
Yugoslavia and remained citizens of that country. By admitting he had an active Yugoslavian passport in response to question 15, Applicant was informing the 
Government of his dual citizenship, thus negating any possible misleading effect of his "no" answer to question 3.</P>
