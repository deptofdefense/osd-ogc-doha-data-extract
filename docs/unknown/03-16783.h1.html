<P>After four alcohol-related driving offenses over a ten-year period and a 1999 diagnosis of alcohol dependence, Applicant continues to drink alcohol. He did not

<P>On November 23, 2004, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption  and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 17, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR responses, Applicant denied 
the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.g. and 1.k  under Guideline G.  He denied all the allegations under Guideline E, SOR subparagraphs 2.a and 2. b. 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 29, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on January 3, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 25, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 57-year-old artillery tester for a defense contractor.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has worked for his present employer since 2002.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He seeks a security clearance.  He is 
married and has two grown children.  From 1965 to 1971, he served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps.  He is a Vietnam veteran.  He is 
described by his supervisors and co-workers as conscientious, dedicated, reliable, and a hard worker.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  While working for his current employer, he has received 
several letters of appreciation<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and was nominated for an award in July 2005.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant started consuming alcohol in 1965 after he joined the military.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He served in the military from 1965 to 1971.  He drank approximately one pitcher of 
beer twice a month.  From 1971 to 1992, his alcohol use increased to six beers two to three times per week.  From 1992 to 2000, he drank alcohol on a daily 
basis.  He drank an average of four to five beers per day.  On occasion he would drink up to ten beers a day.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 6, 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated and Refusing a Chemical Test.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He was given probation before 
judgment for one year.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 19, 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He was found guilty and placed on one year supervised probation, 
60 hours of community service and fined $200.00.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He was also referred by the court to alcohol counseling.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994, Applicant attended court-ordered outpatient alcohol counseling.  The treatment consisted of classes about alcohol abuse and driving after drinking.  
Applicant attended Alcoholic's Anonymous meetings four times a week for a year.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He knew he had a problem with alcohol but did not consider himself to be 
an alcoholic.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He stopped drinking alcohol during the six-month program but starting drinking again after the six-month program ended.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 6, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  The charge was dismissed after the witnesses did not show up 
for court.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 2, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated and Failure to Drive Right of Center.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  He was found guilty and 
placed on 18 months supervised probation, fined $400.00 and court costs.  A February 10, 1999, arrest for DUI was alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g.  At the 
hearing, Applicant testified that he was never arrested in February 1999.  He indicated the only time he was arrested for DUI in 1999 was on October 2, 1999.  
There being no evidence (such as arrest records) to the contrary, I find for Applicant with respect to SOR subparagraph 1.g.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 11, 1999, Applicant voluntarily checked himself in to inpatient alcohol treatment at a Veteran's Administration (VA) hospital.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  He received a 
diagnosis of alcohol dependence from his treating psychiatrists.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> His admission notes indicate that his level of alcohol use prior to admission was a half pint of 
vodka everyday and about six to eight beers per day during the week and double that amount on the weekends.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> On October 28, 1996, he was discharged from 
inpatient treatment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   From November 1999 to July 2002, he attended outpatient treatment.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  He also attended AA meetings for approximately six months to a year.  He considered 
himself to be an alcoholic at the time he attended this treatment.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  For approximately one year, he stopped drinking alcohol.  He started drinking alcohol again 
in late spring/early summer 2000.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  From August 2000 to April 2003, he would drink beer only on the weekends when he was socializing with friends.  He 
estimates this occurs two or three times per month and he drinks four to five beers per occasion.  Since August 2000, he has been intoxicated twice, drinking 12 
beers each time.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 4, 2003, Applicant was sent home from work because he smelled of alcohol and his supervisors thought he was incapable of performing his job in a 
safe and efficient manner.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He  received a verbal warning that should a similar incident occur in the future more severe disciplinary action will be taken.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  He 
was advised of the employee assistance program but declined use of their services.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service on April 25, 2003, Applicant denied drinking 12 to 18 beers and a half pint of vodka on a 
daily basis.  He claimed he had not used vodka for over 30 years.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  At the hearing, he admitted to minimizing the amount of alcohol he used in his signed, 
sworn, statement, because he was ashamed and was afraid his drinking history could prevent him from getting a security clearance.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At present, Applicant considers himself to be a recovering alcoholic.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  His current level of alcohol use is two beers a day during the week and an average of 
four cans of beer on the weekends.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  The last time he drank to intoxication was in December 2005.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> He testified that he does not drink as much as he used to 
since he is aware of the work-related consequences and has gotten more involved in hobbies.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed a security clearance application on February 1, 2002.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  In response to question 24 related to his alcohol arrests/convictions, he listed a 
September 1996 arrest for Driving Under the Influence.  He did not list his March 1990 and March 1992 DUI arrests.  Although he did not list his 1999 DUI 
arrest in response to question 24, he did list it in response to question 26.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  He first denied deliberately omitting his 1990 and 1992 DUI arrests.  He claimed he 
had trouble remembering all of his arrests.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not list all four DUI arrests because he was afraid he would not get a 
clearance and he was ashamed of himself.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his April 6, 2003, signed, sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service, Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested in March 1992.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  
Applicant claims that this omission was an oversight on his part.  He also had the dates confused and initially thought the arrest occurred in 1997 rather than 
1992.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline G, pertaining to alcohol consumption, with its respective DC and MC, applies in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a 
fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in 
the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; 
(3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> The decision to 
deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-16783.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption:  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines G, Alcohol Consumption and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence establishes potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1: (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, 
fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>) applies because Applicant has had four DUI arrests from 1990 to 1999.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC DC E2.A7.1.2.2: (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty  in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job</EM>) 
applies with respect to the April 2003 incident where Applicant was sent home from work when his supervisor concluded he was either too intoxicated or 
impaired to be able to perform his job safely. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC DC E2.A7.1.2.3:  (<EM>Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence</EM>) applies.  Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a credentialed medical professional during his inpatient alcohol treatment at the VA 
hospital.  There are several entries in his treatment records where it is clear that he was examined by staff psychiatrists as well as the alcohol counselors. I find 
there is sufficient evidence to conclude the staff psychiatrists made the diagnosis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5:  (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>) applies.  Applicant's consumption of alcohol since 1990 
resulted in four DUI arrests  and one incident where he showed up for work in an impaired condition.  His habitual consumption of alcohol has resulted in at 
least five occasions where he showed impaired judgment.  On four occasions he drove while intoxicated and on one occasion he showed up for his work in an 
impaired condition and was sent home.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC DC E2.A7.1.2.6:  (<EM>Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an 
alcohol rehabilitation program) </EM>applies.  Applicant attended alcohol treatment in 1999 he received a diagnosis of alcohol dependence by the staff psychiatrist.  
He remained sober for about six to eight months but resumed drinking alcohol in Spring/Summer 2000.  He initially indicated he drank only on the weekends 
two to three times a month when he socialized with friends.  At the hearing, he indicated that he drinks alcohol on a daily basis, two to three beers during the 
work week and double that on the weekends.  He occasionally drinks to intoxication.  Since resuming drinking alcohol in 2000, his frequency of alcohol use has 
increased from twice a month to daily use.  This remains a concern as well as the fact that Applicant has minimized his alcohol use in the past. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find none of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant's case.  Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.1: (<EM>The alcohol-related 
incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>) does not apply.  He has over a ten-year history of alcohol-related arrests.  He appears to attempt to reduce the level of his 
alcohol use after each incident but slowly increases the level of his alcohol use over time.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2: (<EM>The problem occurred a number of years and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>) does not apply.  Applicant's most recent 
alcohol-related incident occurred in 2003 when he showed up for work in an impaired condition.  It may have occurred a number of years ago but one should 
also consider Applicant's reaction to this incident overall.  This incident occurred after the Applicant had underwent treatment and was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent.  It occurred after he submitted his application for a security clearance.  He should have been aware with four DUIs that his alcohol use would come 
under scrutiny in his background investigation.  He was informed of the opportunity to use the services of the Employee Assistance Program.  He declined 
assistance.  At hearing, Applicant stated he considers himself a recovering alcoholic.  Yet, he still drinks on daily basis and on occasion drinks to the point of 
intoxication.  Applicant has not met his burden to apply this mitigating condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3: (<EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>) does not apply since Applicant drinks alcohol on a daily basis.  Cutting down 
alcohol consumption is not indicative of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.  He no longer attends AA meetings or similar support groups.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, AC MC E2.A7.1.3.4: (<EM>Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from 
alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is 
a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>) does not apply.  Although Applicant successfully completed alcohol treatment, his current alcohol 
use negates any attempt at applying this mitigating condition since he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given his past history of alcohol abuse, I cannot conclude Appellant's claims that he has reduced the amount he drinks sufficient enough to mitigate the security 
concern.  Although Applicant appears to be highly thought of by his co-workers, a concern remains because he still drinks alcohol on a daily basis despite his 
past problems with alcohol.  His minimization of the extent of his alcohol use in the past only heightens the security concern.  Accordingly, Guideline G is 
concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a prima facie case with respect to the allegation in SOR subparagraph 2.a but did not establish a prima facie case with respect to 
SOR subparagraph 2.b.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegation in SOR subparagraph 2.b states Applicant deliberately provided false information to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service when he 
provided an April 16, 2003, signed, sworn statement indicating three of his four DUI arrests but deliberately failed to list the DUI arrest alleged in SOR 
subparagraph 1.d.  Applicant maintains that he has difficulty recalling all of his DUI arrests and he essentially overlooked this arrest.  I find his explanation 
credible.  The record evidence shows that Applicant was confused over the actual dates of other DUI arrests he listed as well.  For instance, he initially thought 
his October 1999 arrest occurred in March 1999.  In addition, he provided another signed, sworn statement on April 25, 2003, explaining the omitted DUI 
arrest.  I find the government did not establish a prima facie case with respect to SOR subparagraph 2.b.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges Applicant deliberately omitted alcohol-related arrests on his security clearance application.  Applicant admitted that he 
deliberately did not list his 1990 and 1992 arrests for DUI on his security clearance application because he was ashamed and he was concerned he would not get 
a security clearance.  I find he deliberately falsified his security clearance application by failing to list the arrests listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d.  The 
allegation indicated Applicant failed to list the arrests listed in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d and 1.h.  At the hearing, it was discovered that SOR subparagraphs 
1.b and 1.c are the same incident.  Applicant listed the arrest alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.h in response to another question on the security clearance 
application.  I conclude Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application by omitting the arrests alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 1.2.2: (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal 
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) </EM>applies.  Applicant deliberately did not list his two earlier 
DUI arrests which are alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d on his security clearance application, partly out of shame and partly out concern that he would 
not get a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find none of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply to Applicant's case.  Applicants are required to be truthful with the Government at all times.  A 
lack of candor raises questions as to whether the person is trustworthy enough to protect classified information.  Deliberate falsification can be mitigated if as 
alleged under PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3: (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts).  </EM>In this 
case,  Applicant has failed to meet his burden that he made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsification.  It appears the Defense Security Service 
Special Agent confronted him with the facts about his other alcohol arrests during his interviews.  Accordingly Guideline E, is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
