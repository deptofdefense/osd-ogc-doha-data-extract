<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 12, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant him access to classified information.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On October 1, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer).  He admitted &para;&para; 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., in part, and 1.h., and denied &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 
1.c., and 1.e. allegations, and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 17, 2005, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was mailed to Applicant on November 23, 2005.  He acknowledged receipt of the FORM on 
December 7, 2005, and on January 14, 2006, submitted additional information for consideration to information contained in the FORM within the 30-day period provided to him.  On February 17, 2006, 
the case was assigned to me.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations </SPAN>are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old married man. Applicant was born in Kazakhstan and his wife was born in Russia.  They were married in Moscow, Russia, in February 1975.  They have two Russian born 
daughters, ages 29 (older daughter) and 21 (younger daughter).  Applicant, his wife, and two daughters apparently immigrated to the U.S. around 1991.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant was granted a visa to enter the U.S. 
as a person of extraordinary ability.  Upon Applicant's arrival in the U.S., he was employed in the academic community for several years, and then shifted to the private sector in the mid-1990s.  Since 
January 2003, Applicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, as a senior software engineer.  He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant holds a Ph.D. in physics and mathematics.  When he left Russia, he was a department head at a prestigious institute in Russia doing work related to computer simulation of physical processes 
in the Earth's atmosphere, such as whistler waves propagation in the atmosphere.  He worked at that institute from approximately 1978 to 1995.  He has published approximately 30 papers in 
international scientific journals.  Applicant described his working conditions in that institute as "quite liberal," and added there was no requirement to be a member of the Communist Party, and that he 
was not a member of the Communist Party.  He attributes his time at the institute as providing him with the opportunity "to develop [his] knowledge and become a valuable scientist."  </P> 
 
<P>In September 2002, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen and received his U.S. passport in May 2003.  In August 2004, his wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen, in May 2005, his older 
daughter became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and in November 2004, his younger daughter became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  </P> 
 
<P>When the SOR was issued, Applicant's older daughter was attending a university in Russia studying for her Ph.D. in medical sciences.  In the process of earning her Ph.D. in Russia, she was required to 
spend time in Russia, and traveled back and forth to the U.S.  In November 2005, Applicant's older daughter was awarded her Ph.D., and in December 2005, she returned to the U.S.  Applicant 
indicated his daughter pursued her Ph.D. in Russia "because it is not very expensive compared to the United States and her mother who was a nurse had a good relationship with the school."  The 
FORM did not offer any cost comparisons for Applicant's daughter to attend a U.S. state school versus the cost of sending her to Russia to pursue her Ph.D.  Applicant's two daughter's reside with him 
and his wife in the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's only immediate resident citizen family member in Russia is a 43-year-old married sister.  Initially, Applicant indicated his sister was employed as a "wholesale manager in commerce."  He 
later added that his sister works as a "low level clerk in a small commerce company" and further added that the Russian government does not have a legitimate way of influencing such small companies 
in today's political climate.  Applicant's brother-in-law has "stable and reasonably paid work in small commerce."  Applicant's sister and brother-in-law have one daughter, who is attending a university 
in Russia.  The FORM provides no information regarding the nature, quality, frequency, and method of Applicant's contact, if any, with his sister.</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleged Applicant owned land in Russia, given to him by the Russian government, and also that he was a former part owner of some apartments in Russia that he had sold to his wife and 
daughter.  Applicant initially indicated a Russian village mayor had given him land for "small money."  In October 2005,  he sold the Russian land along with the existing building to his older daughter 
for approximately $2,000.00.  In December 2003, Applicant transferred the interest he held in his Russian apartment to his wife.  The Russian apartment was owned by Applicant, his wife, and his 
mother-in-law.  He explained the reason he sold the real property to his daughter was to alleviate security concerns over his owning land in Russia, and by selling the land to his daughter, he was able to 
circumvent the cost and length of time associated with trying to sell the land to a Russian buyer while living in the U.S.  </P> 
 
<P>Concerning the apartment, he explained Russian law precludes him from selling his partial interest to anyone other than those who are partial owners.  Applicant assets that the value of the land and 
apartment owned by his wife and daughter in Russia is approximately $60,000.00 in contrast to his U.S. holdings, which consist of $600,000.00 in equity  in his U.S. house and $200,000.00 in cash 
reserves.</P> 
 
<P>Since Applicant moved to the U.S., he has returned to Russia at least three times.  In July 1998, he returned to help his older daughter set up her residence.  In July/August 2000, he returned to resolve 
issues concerning the property he owned.  In July 2003, he returned to make arrangements to sell/transfer his land and apartment in Russia.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant stated he has never been involved with any individual, group, organization, and/or affiliation that advocates the unlawful overthrow of the U.S. government.  He asserts he and his family are 
completely loyal to the U.S. and supportive of the general policy goals of the U.S.  He has no business contacts with anyone in any foreign country, nor does he have any contact with anyone connected 
with a foreign country.  He added there is nothing in his background or his family's background that would make him or his family vulnerable to duress.  He has not been contacted by  or received any 
requests or threats from anyone with a foreign country, and if he did, he would immediately report such contact to proper authority.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted a work performance evaluation covering the period of January 2003 to December 2003, with an summary assessment reflecting "outstanding" performance.</P> 
 
<P>Russia has emerged as the largest successor state following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Although tremendous changes have taken place within Russia since the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, Russia has many attributes of an authoritarian government.  The government submitted extensive materials regarding Russia, which I considered, and are included in the FORM (Items 6 through 
11). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take into account 
both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. The guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured 
against them as they represent policy guidance governing the granting or denial of access to classified information. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The 
presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">is the 
applicable relevant adjudicative guideline.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The 
government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> a prima facie case that it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. 
Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure 
each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> security concern exists when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of 
other countries are also relevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, common sense suggests </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that the stronger the ties of affection or 
obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In every security clearance case an applicant's ties or connections to any foreign country require careful examination.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Notwithstanding, the mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign 
country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The language of the foreign influence guideline does not require a conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exists based solely on an applicant's 
family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable 
security concern or risk.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government established a prima facie case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">has ties of affection or obligation with his sister and her family, who are resident citizens of Russia.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  
Unfortunately, there is nothing in the record that discusses the nature and quality of that relationship.  The bond between most siblings is sufficient enough to warrant concern.  To add further confusion, 
Applicant initially described his sister as a "wholesale manager in commerce, and later described her as a "low level clerk in a small commerce company."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government further established the presence of foreign influence as a result of Applicant's real estate holdings in Russia.  When the SOR was issued, Applicant owned real property in Russia, and 
also owned an interest in an apartment in Russia.  He submitted evidence that he sold his interest in his real property to his older daughter in October 2005, and transferred the interest in his apartment to 
his wife in December 2003.  He retained interest in these properties from the time he arrived in the U.S. until owning them became a security issue.  Transferring them to an immediate family member, 
i.e. oldest daughter and wife, both of whom live in his home, on the heels of the security clearance process, is hardly viewed as divestiture of his Russian real estate holdings and eliminating the 
potential for coercion.  His past employment and significant connection with a prestigious Russian institute and his travels to Russia raise further concerns that have not been adequately addressed.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is noted that Applicant's wife, and two daughters have become U.S. citizens since the SOR was issued.  Additionally, Applicant's older daughter has completed her Ph.D. in Russia, has returned to the 
U.S., and resides with Applicant.  Accordingly, the concerns alleged in &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.c. are considered mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The ultimate burden to prove security clearance eligibility rests with the Applicant.  An administrative judge cannot speculate on matters of this nature.  Absent proof to the contrary, the fact that 
Applicant has close ties of affection to persons who are either citizens or residents of Russia is sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure by a foreign country.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  Applicant's recent ownership of Russian property interests that are now retained by his wife and oldest daughter, both living in his household, create the 
potential for coercion.  Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: <EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">and DC 6: <EM>Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government;</EM> apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In deciding whether Applicant's family members are in a position to be exploited, I considered Russia's form of government.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Although Russia has made great strides since the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union in 1991, Russia is country ruled by an authoritarian government.  The U.S. and Russia seem to have a friendly, cooperative relationship as demonstrated by their diplomatic status, the 
foreign assistance provided to Russia, and their mutual interests in combating terrorism.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As such, the security concerns raised by Russia are less than those raised by a country hostile to the U.S. 
Nevertheless, the concerns still exist, because even friendly countries have interests that are contrary to the national interest of the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It was the Applicant's responsibility to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the foreign influence concerns raised by his family ties. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The existing minimal record leaves much to be desired in the form 
of evidence as to whether any of Applicant's Russian family members are agents of a foreign power<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> or employed by or connected to a foreign government or in positions where they are likely to be 
exploited by a foreign power. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The lack of information concerning Applicant's relatives, and his failure to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">demonstrate that his family members are not in a position to be exploited, by either coercive or 
non-coercive means, by a foreign government in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to those relatives and loyalty to the U.S., precludes a finding that any of the Guideline B mitigating 
conditions apply.<A HREF="05-04337.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  The same holds true for his recent Russian real estate holdings, employment with a Russian institute, and visits to Russia.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. Considering all relevant and material 
facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's statement, his family ties to foreign nationals, the whole person concept, and the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, I find 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P>
