<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 30, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 25, 2002. The case was assigned to the undersigned on January 23, 2003. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on February 4, 2003, and the hearing was held on February 26, 2003. The transcript was received on March 12, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 34 years of age. She is employed as a systems administrator by a defense contractor.</P> 
 
<P>In October 1991, applicant was charged with three felony offenses: (1) Conspiracy to Commit a Crime, (2) Embezzlement of Public Money,  and (3) Aid By 
isrepresentation - Over $400.00. In August 1992, she was convicted of Aid By Misrepresentation  - Over $400.00, and a second charge relating to her willful 
use of a false statement to obtain and retain aid for children in the amount of $6,491.00. She was sentenced to one day in jail, fined $200.00, ordered to serve 25 
days of community service, ordered to pay $6,491.00 in restitution (at the rate of $75.00 per month commencing in September 1992)<A HREF="02-22685.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>, and placed on probation 
for three years. At the sentencing hearing the Court reduced applicant's criminal offenses to misdemeanors.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed, sworn statement that she gave to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in May 2002 (Exhibit 3), applicant described her 
involvement in the criminal conduct as follows:</P> 
 
<P>I was working with (coworker and friend hereinafter identified as X) who had previously worked at the Department of Social Services (DSS). X still had friends 
that worked there. I was 18 years old at the time and X was 34 years old. X and I became friends and would hang out after work. After we had known each other 
for several months, she told me about problems she was having with her oldest daughter who was stealing money from her and writing checks on her checking 
account. X said that she needed to close her bank account because of that. X asked me if I had a bank account and told me she had to cash some checks that 
were from the DSS for child support. The checks would vary in amounts from $700.00 to $1500.00. Since we were friends, I deposited the checks in my 
checking accounts because I could not just cash the checks because I did not have enough in the account. I would then withdraw money from the ATM 
machine, $300.00 at a time to give X her money. Basically, X was using my bank account as her own. This went on for probably eight or nine months until I 
finally questioned her about it. X told me that these checks were from the DSS based on monies received for child support and that is why the amounts varied. I 
just felt that something was not right and told her I could not let her use my bank account any more. X and I worked at the same location (name deleted) when I 
first met her and within a few months of me cashing the checks for her, X went back to work for the DSS. An investigator for the District Attorney (county 
deleted) contacted me and told me that X and several other of her coworkers from DSS, their family and friends were involved in this Welfare Fraud. Because 
they had pulled the checks that she had given me to cash and saw my name, signature and bank account number, I was then implicated as being involved. I told 
the investigator that I did not know anything about welfare fraud and explained to them that X had asked me to cash the checks because of problems she was 
having with her daughter.</P> 
 
<P>I received a notice to appear in court, I was never arrested and transported to jail. I was assigned a public defender and worked with him for awhile and could 
never prove that I did not keep the money because everything I gave X was in cash. The 1<SUP>st</SUP> two charges were dropped and because I could not prove my story, I 
was convicted of the Welfare charge, which was a misdemeanor.<STRONG> </STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">I did not know what X was doing, she never confided in me that she was stealing from the 
DSS </SPAN>(emphasis added). I never kept any of the money for myself. It was all her money. I deposited the checks that X had asked me to cash and withdrew the 
money from an ATM machine and gave her cash. The amount of $6,491.00 reflects that amount of checks that went through my bank account. This is the 
money that (state agency) is asking me to pay in restitution.</P> 
 
<P>When I look back on it now, I was so naive and so trusting. It was not my intention to defraud or steal any money. As a single parent, I was working and going 
to school and was setting goals for daughter and myself. I would never think of doing anything illegal or anything like this. I have not been involved in anything 
like this since.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's account of her involvement in the fraud, particularly her denial that she knowingly participated in it, differs sharply from how <EM>her</EM> <EM>attorney</EM> 
described it in papers he filed with the court seeking leniency (Exhibit 5). In pertinent part, he described applicant's participation as follows:</P> 
 
<P>(Applicant) was involved in cashing 2 groups of checks for the defendant, X, in 1987 and again in 1989.</P> 
 
<P>X had been  friendly and supportive to (applicant), who was an unmarried mother who had just turned 19 and was supporting herself and her infant daughter. X 
was also her supervisor, a woman almost twice her age (34 years old) and she displayed concern for (applicant) the way (applicant's) own mother never did. X 
had been (applicant's) supervisor for some time when in 1987 she first approached (applicant) to assist her because of "problems with her checking account" 
due to her daughter forging her checks.</P> 
 
<P>X had 3 teenage daughters who (applicant) knew were often the source of behavior problems. X told her that her oldest daughter had stolen some of her checks 
and cashed them by forging X's signature. X said she had to close out her checking account and needed a way to cash checks, so she asked (applicant) to let her 
put checks through X's checking account until X could straighten out her old checking account and arrange to open a new, more secure checking account. X 
believed her and had no reason to believe X had lied to her. All the checks X deposited through (applicant) in 1987 were only made payable to X.</P> 
 
<P>After some time, (applicant) saw that most of the checks were . . . welfare checks and the amounts of the checks, even though they were payable to X, seemed 
too large. Although she was not familiar with the welfare . . . payment system, she eventually gathered the courage to ask X why there were so many checks and 
why they were so large.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> X eventually admitted she was involved in cashing welfare checks to which she was not entitled. This was the first time (applicant) 
knew that anything illegal was involved in X's cashing of these checks</SPAN> (emphasis added), and asked X to "please stop" cashing any other checks through her 
checking account.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>X again approached (applicant) in 1989 and asked if she could help her cash some checks again. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">This time (applicant) was aware that what X asked was wrong 
</SPAN>(emphasis added) and at first said she would like to but should not help her do anything like that again. However, X begged and pleaded with her, saying that 
she was in desperate financial straights and reminding (applicant) of everything X had done to help (applicant) as her supervisor. X also said that she only 
needed (applicant's) help for 2 months<STRONG>. </STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">(Applicant) finally agreed to help her for only 2 months</SPAN> (emphasis added).  Later she learned that the checks to be 
cashed would be coming in her own name. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">She nonetheless helped X, but when the checks continued to come after 2 months, she told X she just could not help 
her anymore because it was wrong</SPAN> (emphasis added). (Applicant) made sure the checks were simply cashed and the money turned over to X; she kept none of 
the money from the 1989 series of checks.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing applicant offered yet a third explanation, to wit: when she found out from X that what X was doing was illegal, she stopped helping her (TR at 
34). Applicant could not explain why her attorney would prepare a document containing such a different version of events (TR at 49-50; 55-56).</P> 
 
<P>In 1994, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and (2) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol with a .08% Blood 
Alcohol Level. She pleaded guilty to Count 2. She was fined $1,500.00.</P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges that applicant intentionally falsified material facts (1) in response to Question 21 on a Security Clearance Application (SCA) that she 
executed in March 2002<A HREF="02-22685.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and (2) in a signed, sworn statement that she gave to the Defense Security Service in May 2002.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to the SCA, Question 21 asked if applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? Applicant responded "no."  Her "no" 
response was false because, as noted above, she had been charged with one or more felonies in connection with the welfare fraud incident. Applicant denies that 
she intentionally provided the incorrect answer. She testified, in essence, that she knew she was convicted of a misdemeanor, but never knew that the original 
charges filed against her were felonies. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that applicant did not intentionally provide the false response to this 
question.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to her signed, sworn statement, it is clear that applicant intentionally provided false, material information when she stated, in essence, that she did 
not know she was engaging in illegal activity when she assisted X with the check cashing. Exhibit 5, prepared by her attorney with information undoubtedly 
received from her,<A HREF="02-22685.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and filed with the court, clearly establishes this fact.</P> 
 
<P>Two of applicant's coworkers and her husband appeared at the hearing and testified on her behalf. All three witnesses believe that applicant is a reliable person. 
A Performance Appraisal (Exhibit I) establishes that her work performance is "outstanding."</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The evidence establishes that in the late 1980s, applicant helped a friend commit welfare fraud. Although she continues to deny that she knew the friend was 
engaging in illegal activity at the time she was helping her, the facts speak otherwise. It is simply inconceivable that applicant's attorney would have dreamed 
up the detailed version of events he presented to the court on her behalf. This version of events, which clearly acknowledges applicant's knowing participation 
in the illegality, had to come from applicant. Applicant's involvement in this illegal activity reflects adversely on her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, 
and strongly suggests that she cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>It has been more than ten years since applicant engaged in the illegal activity. During that time, applicant has led a very productive life, as evidenced by, among 
other things, her receipt of a Bachelors degree after attending night school for six years while working full time and raising a daughter as a single mother. These 
facts, as well as the strong character references she has offered into evidence, are <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">positive factors. Had applicant been truthful about her involvement in the 
illegal activity (1) when speaking with the DSS agent in May 2002, (2) in her signed, sworn statement dated May 2002, and (3) while testifying at the hearing, 
these facts would have gone a long way toward mitigating her criminal conduct.<A HREF="02-22685.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> However, applicant was not truthful in her dealings with the DSS agent and 
while she was testifying, and in assessing applicant's current security-worthiness, this dishonest and criminal conduct<A HREF="02-22685.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> cannot be ignored. Considering the 
evidence as a whole, particularly applicant's continuing statements that she did not know X was engaging in illegal activity when she was cashing checks for 
her,  it is not now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
