<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had nine delinquent debts listed on her Statement of Reasons (SOR) for 2006. Her SOR debts initially became delinquent because of her unemployment. </SPAN>Under the "whole person" concept, 
financial considerations are mitigated.  Her false answer on one question on her 2002 and 2004 Questionnaires for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) concerning an arrest and conviction was  because

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On March 11, 2002, and December 22, 2004, Applicant submitted Questionnaires for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 85P).<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN>On June 23, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her,<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges 
trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), J (Criminal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her access to sensitive information, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a such access should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer, dated August 9, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> On December 7, 2006, an Administrative Judge held a brief 
hearing, and approved a delay requested by Applicant's Counsel (Ex. 9).  On December 18, 2006, the case was transferred to me. On January 30, 2007, her hearing was held. I granted Applicant's 
request for delay to submit documentary evidence (R. 17, 84-86). DOHA received the hearing record (R.) on February 7, 2007. I received additional documentary evidence from Applicant on March 
2, 2007, which I admitted into evidence as Exhibit A.    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guidelines E, J and F, Applicant admitted the facts in the following SOR paragraphs: 1.a(1) (she was arrested and charged with a criminal offense that she did not 
disclose on her SF 85P); 1.c(1) to 1.c(9) (she had nine delinquent debts listed in a 2002 credit report); 1.d(1) to 1.d(14) (she had fourteen delinquent debts listed in a 2005 credit report); and 3.a to 3.i 
(she had nine delinquent debts listed in a 2006 credit report).  She denied the other SOR allegations without elaboration. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 39 years old (R. 35).<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She is a high school graduate, and received a diploma in electronic engineering from a technical school in 1988 (R. 35).  She is a single mother with three children 
(R. 22-23). She has no prior military service. She has been employed by government contractors for 15 years and on her current contract since March 2002 (R. 22). Her current employment involves 
engineering for computer systems and information technology. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges that Applicant was required to disclose the debts listed above for SOR &para;&para; 1.c(1) to 1.c(9) on her 2002 SF 85P.  She was required to disclose the debts listed above for SOR &para;&para; 1.d(1) 
to 1.d(14) on her 2004 SF 85P.  The debts listed above for SOR &para; 3.a to 3.i were delinquent at the time of her 2006 credit report.  The majority of the debts listed in the above table resulted from 
medical care her children received, which debts were then sold to various collection agencies.<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was unemployed from November 1999 to March 2000, and again from March 2001 until January 2002. She worked as a bartender from January 2002 until starting her current employment 
on March 11, 2002 (Ex. 1 at 3). Her finances were in turmoil because of the unemployment and underemployment (R. 49-50).  She was "ditching creditors all that time" (R. 59).  She was sending 
other creditors $10 or $20 (R. 61). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the judgment in SOR &para; 3.a, Applicant bought a vacuum cleaner for $1,700 in 1998.  She had difficulty making payments because of unemployment.  She attempted to return the vacuum cleaner 
and to settle the debt. She sent a creditor $400, but after she paid she realized she had no proof of her payment (R. 72). Ultimately, she did not pay because she was unsure about where or who to 
send the money (R. 72).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant paid the debt in SOR &para; 1.c(2) for $1,075 ( R. 77), and subsequent credit reports did not list this debt.  In 2005, she indicated her payments on her student loans were deferred (Ex. 4 at 3). 
At the time of her hearing, her student loan and credit cards were paid off (R. 26, 68, 77, 80).  She believed the only bill that was unpaid were some medical bills (totaling approximately $2,000) (R. 
27, 66).  Her only loan is her car loan (R. 68). Her financial situation is much better now (R. 49).  She was not paying the medical bills in SOR &para;&para; 3.e and 3.f (together totaling about $400) because 
the debt was being transferred between collectors and she wanted to avoid double payments (R. 62, 79). She also recognized she was behind on her utilities (SOR &para; 3.b of $207, and SOR &para; 3.d of 
$710) (R. 79).  The SOR debts in &para;&para; 3.b and 3.d are evidently duplications of the same debt. She disputed the television cable bill in SOR &para; 3.h ($ 658) because it related to equipment that they failed 
to pick up (R. 26, 77).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's take home pay after deductions is $3,680 per month (R. 64).  Her rent was about $1,000 per month and is now decreased to $725 per month (R. 64). Her monthly bills are approximately:  
electricity ($600), telephone ($120 to $300), water ($75), television ($120), medical ($100), car payment ($620), car insurance ($230), gasoline ($400), groceries ($800), and clothing ($400) (R. 64-67).  She explained that her monthly bills varied considerably from month-to-month, and no average was available. <EM>Id</EM>. She has about $2,000 in her savings account (R. 69). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing, Applicant indicated she did not receive any formal financial counseling (R. 68). After her hearing, she provided a certificate explaining she received financial counseling on "February 
27, 2006" (Ex. A).  I find the actual date of financial counseling was February 27, 2007.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was not prepared to thoroughly address her financial issues at her hearing (R. 79-82).  She conceded the financial facts as stated in the SOR were correct (R. 82). She agreed for every debt, 
to provide the current status, including when the creditor was contacted and if payments or a payment plan have been made (R. 81-82). Applicant's counsel agreed that a delay until March 1, 2007, 
would allow sufficient time to provide additional matters concerning payment of debts, and more precise information about her income and debts (R. 84-86, 99, 101-102).  After the hearing was over, 
Applicant provided a list of debts she had paid or settled, including several that were not listed on the SOR, a certificate establishing financial counseling, and a character reference (Ex. A). She was 
reluctant to make any payments on her delinquent debts now because she may lose her job because of the trustworthiness determination (R. 62).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A character reference who has known Applicant for ten years said she shows a high degree of integrity and responsibility.<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She puts the needs and welfare of her children first.  She shows diligence 
and dedication in her support for the Department of Defense. She has good judgment, maturity, and demonstrates a logical approach problem solutions. She is an outstanding asset to her company 
and the Department of Defense.   </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a allege Applicant failed to disclose accurate information to Question 16 (of her March 11, 2002 and December 22, 2004 SF 85Ps), which asks, "<STRONG>YOUR POLICE RECORD</STRONG> 
In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.)"<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant answered, "Yes," and disclosed that she

convictions on her SF 85Ps. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 19, 2000, Applicant went to her boyfriend's residence to collect her property because their relationship had ended due to his infidelity.<A HREF="06-12108.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> Her boyfriend assaulted and threatened her. She 
struck him on the head with a gun case in self-defense. He called the police. She told the police what happened when they arrived at his residence (R. 35-36). Because she showed no signs of injury, 
and he had a scratch on his head, she was arrested and spent the next two days in jail (R. 36-37). Six months later she pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct (R. 39), and she paid a $600 fine. She 
received a deferred adjudication, and thought her record was going to be expunged (R. 30, 41).  She could not find the attorney who handled her assault case (R. 32), but he had told<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> her that the 
assault would be expunged and would not affect her security clearance (R. 42). She put the assault incident behind her, and did not think about it at the time when she filled out her SF 85P (R. 43). 
The only incident that came to mind when she signed the SF 85Ps was her DUI (R. 52).  She checked with the clerk's office and there was no record of her disorderly conduct conviction (R. 48).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.c, 1.d, and 2.a allege Applicant failed to disclose accurate information to Question 20 (of her March 11, 2002 and December 22, 2004 SF 85Ps), which asks, "<STRONG>YOUR FINANCIAL 
RECORD </STRONG>- <STRONG>180-Day Delinquencies </STRONG> Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.)"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
Applicant answered, "No."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing Applicant said in 2002 after she learned that she would be receiving employment with the government contractor, she contacted her creditors and set up payment arrangements (R. 55, 
57-58). She believed she started contacting her creditors in January 2002 (R. 57). She did not believe she was delinquent because she was working with her creditors to resolve her debts (R. 56, 58).  
Her statement about contacting her creditors to make payment arrangements is not corroborated by any documentation.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A one-page statement received from Applicant after her hearing (Ex. A), indicates the first five items listed in the table on page 3, <EM>infra</EM>, were "settled," but there is no evidence about when they were 
settled. I specifically find that the nine debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.c(1) to 1c(9) were not settled and the settlement amounts paid <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">prior to signing her SF 85P</SPAN> on March 11, 2002.  Many of the same delinquent 
debts were reflected on her March 20, 2002, and March 3, 2005, credit bureau reports. Moreover, she admitted in her response to the SOR that the SOR and the two credit bureau reports accurately 
reflected her debts.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The last sentence of her post-hearing submission provides, "Items C7-9 and D4-13 (Statement of Reasons.) working with Consumer credit counseling services to consolidate accounts to bring 
current." (Ex. A). I specifically find that the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.d(4) to 1.d(13) were delinquent prior to her signing her SF 85P on December 22, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the record evidence, I find that she was sincere and truthful about her intent, and her answer on Question 16 of her SF 85Ps.  Her failure to disclose her 2000 arrest for assault 
and conviction of disorderly conduct was an honest mistake, rather than a deliberate lie. However, her answer on Question 20 of her SF 85Ps was deliberately false. She knew she had multiple debts 
delinquent over 180 days, including a judgment, and she failed to disclose those debts. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines &para; 2. An administrative judge's over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guidelines &para; 2(c).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Guidelines &para; 2(a): "(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that "[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security." Guidelines &para; 2(b); Regulation &para; C2.1.2.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions 
that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P>
