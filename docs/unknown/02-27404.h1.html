<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>		The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR), dated October 27, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to
an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,
or denied. The SOR was based on foreign influence (guideline B) concerns because of the foreign
residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated December 2, 2003, to the allegations set forth in
the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 2, 2004, the
case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated February 18,
2004, a hearing was held on March 19, 2004. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits
1- 4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-F) and
offered her own testimony and that of one other witness. The transcript (TR) was received on April
6, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative
Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a., through
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1.d., and 1.e.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Those admissions

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is 41 years old. She is employed as a Senior Infrastructure Specialist by a United
States defense contractor that wants her to have a security clearance. She received two Masters
degrees, in Computer Science and Engineering, the latter in 1990 in a United States university.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant was born in PRC. She came to the United States in 1986. She became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

and a boy, three. Both children were born in the United States and are United States citizens.</SPAN></P>

intends to apply for citizenship when she is eligible. Applicant's father came to the United States in
2003, and he also intends to apply for citizenship when he is eligible (Tr at 40).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's niece came to the United States in 1999 to pursue an education and a career. 
Applicant  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">adopted her niece, who is now 22 years of age,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> to help her remain in this country (Tr at
45, 46).  She is now married, and her husband, a native born United States citizen, testified that his
wife plans to remain in the United States and  to apply for citizenship when she is eligible (Tr at 22-27).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has three sisters and two brothers, who are citizens of and reside in PRC.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> She
speaks to her siblings approximately one time a year. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of these family members, or their spouses

served in the PRC military (Tr at 40-43). </SPAN></P>

1993 and 2002. Before her trip in 2002, she consulted with the security manager of her company to
confirm that such a trip was not unauthorized. She debriefed with the manager upon her return to this
country. This trip was made primarily to help prepare her father for his move to the United States,
and also to show her children the advantages that they had by living in the United States rather than
PRC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Response to SOR)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> doses not anticipate receiving any inheritance or other financial interest from PRC.

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">
considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the overall common sense
determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or
mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">
Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be
measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of
seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation
or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following guideline and
concern most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,
or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could
result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an
individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the
likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As
noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,
if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has five
siblings,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> who are citizens of and reside in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> PRC. The PRC citizenship and residency of Applicant's
family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified
information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.
The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present
evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens of and reside in
PRC comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, immediate family members, or 
persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or
resident in, a foreign country.  The fact that the foreign country in question is PRC, a country under
Communist rule,  is also a concern; but that fact is not automatically controlling. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The primary factors I have considered include: the lack of government involvement of
Applicant's family members and her limited and infrequent contact with them, the fact that her
parents and her adopted daughter now live in the United States and plan to remain here,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> her very
powerful devotion her two children, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's history since coming to the United States,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and her
strong feelings concerning this country</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of
the evidence,  I have determined that her family in PRC do not constitute an unacceptable security
risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, a determination that the immediate family
member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)
involved and the United States, applies.  MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">also applies because Applicant's contacts
with her siblings in PRC are casual and infrequent.	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">		 </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">        	After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating
evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event
pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, she would resist it, and
would  report the incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
