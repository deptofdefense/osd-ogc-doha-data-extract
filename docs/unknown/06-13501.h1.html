<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligation preceding the submission of her Questionnaire For Public Trust Positions submitted in August 
2004.  As of the date she answered her Statement of Reasons in January 2007, she had nine delinquent debts exceeding $37,000.00, raising financial 
considerations concerns.  She offered no evidence mitigating this concern.  Eligibility for assignment to public trust position is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On August 15, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR informed Applicant that based, on information available to the Government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for a public trust 
position.<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 6, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  She requested her case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing.  On December 21, 2006, Department Counsel submitted the government's case through a file of relevant material (FORM),<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> a copy of 
which was provided to the Applicant.  Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  
Applicant submitted an additional document, dated January 23, 2007, without objection from Department Counsel.  The case was assigned to me on February 
1, 2007.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i.  These admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  Applicant denied the allegations in 
subparagraphs 1.b., 1.e., and 1.h.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old customer service representative for a Department of Defense contractor and has been employed by that contractor since October 
1998.  The FORM does not reflect whether she has ever married.  However, Applicant does mention in her January 23, 2007 Response to the FORM that she 
is a "single mom" raising "two kids" and is "expecting" her third child.  She attended a technical school from June 1996 to August 1998, and was awarded a 
certificate.<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In August 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire For Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) in August 2004.  The ensuing investigation revealed Applicant had 
nine bad debts or collection accounts exceeding $37,000.00, reflected in SOR &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.i.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to being a single mother raising two children.  She is also expecting her third child.  She informed the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) investigators<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> that she "will try her best to pay off some of my debt,"<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> stating "I live from paycheck to paycheck."<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The debt alleged has been ongoing.  As of the date the SOR was issued in August 2006, Applicant owed approximately $37,000.00 to nine different creditors.  
Applicant was placed on notice of the government's financial concerns during the two interviews by OPM Investigators in June and July 2005.  Applicant's 
December 2006 credit report indicates her delinquent debts exceed $39,500.00.<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Although she denies three of the debts alleged, i.e. &para;&para; 1.b., 1.e., and 1.h., she 
offers no explanation for her denial.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no evidence in the file to suggest Applicant has paid any of the debts alleged, or that she made any effort to settle or otherwise resolve her debts.  The 
monthly budget she submitted in July 2005, indicates she has a net remainder of $45.54.  None of the line items on her budget apply to any of the debts 
alleged.<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant stated she believes "it is unconstitutional and unfair in a way for a person who has been under contract within a company such as myself for several 
years to be demoted or terminated for security clearance or (sic) purposes if I never committed crime before . . . ."  She further states she is a "good U.S. 
citizen" and has to think "about the welfare of my children and I would never use other identities to get what I want."  She concludes, "I would love for you to 
make the determination for me to keep my job so I can grow more years within the company."<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive 
&para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 
at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.<A HREF="06-13501.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Similarly, an individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in his obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one 
aspect of life can often indicate how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations that preceded the submission of her SF 85P in August 2004.  In June and July 2005, she was 
confronted by government investigators regarding her indebtedness, and was made aware of the government's concerns.  Her June 2005 Personal Financial 
Statement suggests she does not have the ability to repay her nine outstanding debts in excess of $37,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial problems are recent and ongoing.  Applicant's unwillingness or inability to honor her financial obligations is evidenced by the delinquent 
debts she has been carrying for years, and her failure to show meaningful efforts to repay creditors or otherwise resolve her financial situation.  Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts, </EM>apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After reviewing the evidence, I am unable to find any applicable mitigating conditions.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's response is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly 
with her financial obligations.  Applicant presented no evidence of paid debts, settlements, negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial 
assistance/counseling, or that she has otherwise made meaningful efforts to resolve her financial situation.  Applicant's financial history and lack of favorable 
evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of financial responsibility. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered Applicant's case in light of the whole person concept.  Based on the limited evidence available, it appears Applicant is financially overextended.  It 
is unlikely she will be able to overcome her financial difficulties based on her personal situation.  I considered the fact she is a single mother with two children 
living from paycheck to paycheck, and expecting her third child.  I specifically considered that she is a good citizen, that she "loves" her job, and desires to 
remain employed.  Applicant has not mitigated this security concern.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant
