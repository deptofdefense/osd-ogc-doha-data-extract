<P>	On October 4, 1996 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral
to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or
revoked.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR on October 16, 1996 and elected to have his case decided
on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished copies of the File of Relevant Materials
(FORM) on November 19, 1996 and is credited with receiving them on November 25, 1996.  He
provided no written response within the time (30 days) provided by the Directive.  The case was
assigned to another Administrative Judge on April 22, 1997 and reassigned to this Administrative
Judge on April 23, 1997.  </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Upon discovery of a missing page three in the SOR and Applicant's apparent non-receipt of
the same page, the case file was returned on June 18, 1997 to Department Counsel for suggested
resubmission of the complete SOR to Applicant for response.  A new SOR was mailed to Applicant
with the missing page included.  And on August 18, 1997, a notarized supplementary answer
(bearing an August 6, 1997 execution date) was received by DOHA and resubmitted to this
Administrative Judge (on August 19, 1997) for disposition. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF FACTS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant is 34 years of age and has been employed by his current defense contractor
(Company A) since May 1994.  He seeks a security clearance at the level of secret.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P>

<P>	Applicant is alleged to have (1) used marijuana, with varying frequency, at times daily, from
approximately 1981 to at least June 1996, (2) purchased marijuana, with varying frequency, from
approximately 1981 to at least June 1996, (3) cultivated marijuana sometime between approximately
1978 and 1980, (4) used crack cocaine, on approximately 2 to 4 occasions, from approximately April
1992 and April 1994, (5) used amphetamines, dextroamphetamine, and/or methamphetamine
(crank), on approximately 5 occasions, from approximately 1983 to 1984, and on approximately 5
occasions from approximately October 1995 to at least February 1996, (6) used marijuana and crack
cocaine after being issued a security clearance on May 7, 1990 and (7) used marijuana,
amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and/or methamphetamine (crank) after being issued a security
clearance on May 3, 1994.</P>

<P>	Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his National Agency Questionnaire
("NAQ") executed on October 9, 1993 by omitting his prior cultivation of marijuana between 1978
and 1980, his use and purchase of marijuana between 1981 and at least October 1993, his use of
crack cocaine on two to three occasions between April 1992 and October 1993, and his use of
amphetamines, dextroamphetamines, and/or methamphetamines (crank) on five occasions between
1983 and 1984 and (b) falsified his signed, sworn statement given to DIS on March 27, 1996 by
omitting his (i) use of crack cocaine, amphetamines, dextroamphetamines, and/or methamphetamines
(crank), and (ii) his use and purchases of marijuana.</P>

<P>	And Applicant is alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct by dint of his arrest on October
3, 1995 in State A for aggravated battery/domestic violence (a felony), his later plea of guilty to
simple assault, his ensuing sentence to serve 16 days in jail, and his award of probation for 12
months, conditioned on his attending anger control, receiving an alcohol evaluation, his performance
of 50 hours of community service, and his payment of costs in the amount of $100.00.</P>

<P>	For his response to the SOR, Applicant admits most of the allegations, denying his ever
cultivating marijuana, and adding several explanations: His use of marijuana for recreational
purposes only (never to the point of addiction), his discontinuance of daily marijuana use since 1987,
his assurances that he will never use crack cocaine again, and his lack of realization at the time of
the impact or severity of his omissions.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Applicant's pleading admissions are incorporated herein by reference as relevant and material
findings of fact.  Additional findings follow.<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Applicant's first introduction to marijuana came in about 1978, when at the age of 15 he tried
to grow a single marijuana plant.  The plant had grown to be about a foot in height when his
girlfriend's mother found it and flushed it down the toilet.  Applicant made no further attempts to
cultivate marijuana.</P>

<P>	Applicant first used marijuana in 1981 at the age of 18.  Starting slowly, he increased his rate
of use to daily use, a frequency he maintained between 1983 and 1984.  Moving to State A in 1985,
he reduced his marijuana use to twice weekly and generally maintained this frequency of use until
he commenced work with his current employer in April 1987.  With the learning demands placed
on him to master complex electrical systems for use in his work, he found it necessary to further
limit his use of marijuana to around two to three times a month.  Applicant continued his smoking
of marijuana at the rate of twice to thrice monthly at least until June 1996.  Use of the substance
made him feel relaxed and lazy.  To meet his personal needs, he purchased marijuana during the
covered period of his use, with his purchases ranging from zero to $30.00 per purchase.</P>

<P>	Besides marijuana, Applicant used other illegal substances.  He tried amphetamines,
dextroamphetamines, and/or methamphetamine (crank) on approximately five occasions between
1983 and 1984 while living in State B.  After a considerable hiatus away from these drugs, he
resumed his use of the same in 1995 after moving to State A (using it on approximately 5 occasions). 
He also tried crack cocaine on two to four occasions between April 1992 and April 1994.  While this
drug gave him a quick rush, he soon found that he didn't like it and ceased using it altogether.</P>

<P>	Applicant's use and purchase of these illegal substances persisted even after he was given
his security clearance (<EM>i.e., </EM>on May 7, 1990 and again on May 3, 1994).</P>

<P>	When asked to complete his NAQ on October 9, 1993, Applicant responded in the negative
to questions 20.a and 20.b, which inquired about his past use and purchases, respectively, of illegal
substances.  Applicant attributes his lying to his fear of jeopardizing his chances for holding a 
security clearance and his belief that his omissions were not that serious (<EM>see</EM> FORM, item 6).  He
was afforded an additional opportunity to respond to questions about his prior substance abuse in
a scheduled interview of March 26, 1996, but declined again to acknowledge any of the details of
his prior use of illegal substances.  He could offer no explanation as to how anyone could claim he
used illegal substances, insisting that such allegations, if made, were totally untrue.  Inferences
warrant that Applicant's omissions were made knowingly and wilfully.</P>

<P>	Not until confronted by DIS Agent B with his prior omissions about his involvement with
illegal drugs in a second DIS interview (<EM>i.e., </EM>on July 10, 1996) did Applicant come forward with the
full history of his prior use and purchase of illegal substances.  Applicant's admissions were made
free of any threats or promises from the interviewing DIS agent.</P>

<P>	Applicant's aggravated battery/domestic violence arrest of October 3, 1995 was preceded by
his grabbing his wife by the arms and pushing her to the floor following a heated argument.  Getting
on top of her, he pounded his fist in a threatening gesture and struck her in the mouth with the back
of his hand.  The blow itself packed enough force to loosen one of his wife's teeth and necessitated
dental repairs.   Despite Applicant's apologies, his wife filed a complaint with State A's local police,
who in turn charged Applicant with aggravated battery/domestic violence (a felony).  Following his
accepted guilty plea for simple assault on or about November 14, 1995, Applicant was sentenced to
serve 16 days in jail and awarded 12 months of unsupervised probation, conditioned on his (a)
attending anger control counseling sessions, (b) receiving an alcohol evaluation, (c) performing 50
hours of community service, and (d) paying costs in the approximate amount of $100.00.  Available
documentation is sufficient to credit Applicant with the payment of court costs, but not the remaining
probation conditions.  Applicant provides no probative written assurances of when he expects to
complete the remaining conditions of his probation, and none can be inferred from the evidence of
record.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Adjudication Guidelines of the Directive (Change 3) lists "binding" policy
considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process of most all DOHA cases. The
term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the
"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying
Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not
a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  It does not require the Judge to assess
these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant adjudication guidelines,
judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation
set forth in F.3 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, as well as the Directive's preamble to Change 3,
which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</P>

</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an
Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do
so is <U>clearly</U> <U>consistent</U> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative
Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate
determination of an applicant's suitability for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw
only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Put
another way, the Judge cannot draw inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controversial fact[s]
alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus
to the applicant's inability to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of
nexus, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant
has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or
controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or
her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the
Government's case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSION</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P>	Applicant's involvement with illegal substances is both varied and prolonged.  He brings
with him a 15-year history of marijuana involvement that includes an established regular rate of use
between 1983 and at least June 1996 (at rates of use ranging between daily and twice weekly).  His
marijuana activity encompassed purchases as well to support his personal needs over the entire
spectrum of his involvement with the substance.  Only his brief experiment in cultivating a
marijuana plant as a young teenager is sufficiently dated and isolated to be of no current security
significance.</P>

<P>	Raised security concerns extend also to Applicant's use of other illegal substances: Crack
cocaine (on two to four occasions between April 1992 and at least April 1994) and amphetamine,
dextroamphetamine, and/or methamphetamine (crank) on five occasions during the period of 1983
and 1984 and on some five additional occasions during an 8-month stretch between October 1995
and at least February 1996.  Considered alone, his use of these drugs might be considered either
experimental or occasional, but when appraised in connection with his contemporaneous use of
marijuana, they become a part of a much more concentrated pattern of ongoing substance abuse. 
From a clearance standpoint, Applicant's use of these drugs should be cumulated along with his
active use of marijuana during this same time period and considered regular on an overall basis. 
That Applicant continued to use these illegal substances after obtaining both his initial clearance (in
ay 1990) and his updated clearance (in May 1994) only heightens the security concerns raised by
his involvement with illegal substances.</P>

<P>	On the strength of this record, several of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative
Guidelines are applicable: DC 1 (any drug use), DC 2 (illegal drug possession) and DC 3 (failure to
complete a drug treatment program).  Government carries it initial burden in its establishing the
security significance of Applicant's involvement with the subject illegal substances.</P>

<P>	With acknowledged substance abuse still so recent (<EM>i.e., </EM>June 1996) and no available
documentation of any sustained discontinuance of illegal drugs, Applicant's mitigation showing is
considerably weakened.  He can realistically take advantage of none of the available mitigation
conditions in either the Adjudicative Guidelines or the more general F.3 considerations.  Risks
persist that he might once again succumb to temptations to return to drug abuse in the foreseeable
future, enough at this time to prevent his carrying his evidentiary burden.  Sub-paragraphs 1.a and
1.b and 1.d through 1.g are concluded unfavorably to Applicant.  By contrast, sub-paragraph 1.c
(cultivation of marijuana), which is too aged and isolated to have any current security significance,
is resolved favorably to Applicant.</P>

<P>	Just as significant are the security concerns raised by Applicant's repeated failures to provide
full and accurate details about his substance abuse history when afforded opportunities to do so in
his NAQ and ensuing DIS interview.  So much trust is imposed on those cleared to see classified
information that accommodations for breaches are necessarily calibrated very narrowly.  <EM>See Snepp
v. United States, </EM>444 U.S. 506, 511n.6 (1980).  Applicant's earlier denials of any prior involvement
with illegal substances were followed by repeated denials of involvement in a follow-up March 1996
DIS interview.  Not until confronted by Agent B did Applicant choose to disclose the extent of his
drug activities.   His omissions are material and are covered by a host of Adjudicative Guidelines
(for falsification): DC 2 (falsification of a security form), DC 3 (providing false information to an
investigator) and DC 5( pattern dishonesty).  None of his omissions were corrected under
circumstances consistent with recognized prompt, good faith disclosure guidelines.  <EM>See </EM>DISCR Case
No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995).  Applicant's repeated omissions afford no room for extenuation or
mitigation credit and preclude his taking advantage of either MC 3 (prompt, good faith disclosure)
of the Adjudicative Guidelines (for falsification) or any of the broader tenets of F.3 of the Directive
and the Change 3 amendments.</P>

<P>	Conclusions warrant that under the circumstances presented by the record, Applicant's 
lapses in his responses to inquiries about his prior use and possession of illegal substances
(marijuana included) do not comport with the high standards of trust imposed on persons granted
security clearances.  Applicant fails to carry his proof burden, and sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b are
concluded unfavorably to him.</P>

<P>	Both Applicant's assault conviction and ensuing omissions reflect pattern criminal conduct
that are not probatively extenuated or mitigated by either the passage of time or his furnished
explanations.  While his assault conviction would appear to be of a misdemeanor nature only, his
NAQ and later DIS omissions constitute felonious conduct under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001, which are
more difficult to extenuate or mitigate.  That he was never charged or convicted for falsification does
not absolve him of imputed criminal conduct for purposes of assessing his clearance suitability.  <EM>See
</EM>DOHA Case No. 94-0215 (April 13, 1995).  In Applicant's case, his covered criminal actions are
too recent and recurring to be extenuated or mitigated by either his furnished explanations or the
passage of time.  Sub-paragraphs 3.a and 3.b are concluded against him as well.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in F.3 of the Directive and the Directive's Guidelines enumerated in the preamble
of the Change 3 Amendments to 5220.6 to the raised security concerns.</P>
