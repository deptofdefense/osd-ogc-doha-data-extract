<P>Despite efforts to lessen his control of a company he founded in the U.S., Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised regarding his ownership of Indian 
entities and involvement in other industry related activities in his country of origin. Applicant also has family living in India and owns rental real estate. 
Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 19, 2004, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> 
</SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated September 30, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on February 10, 2005, and a Notice of Hearing was issued April 1, 2005, for a hearing on May 17, 2005. The Government introduced five 
exhibits at the hearing and requested that administrative notice be taken of three documents. The Applicant introduced 15 exhibits. All were accepted into 
evidence. The Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. The transcript was received on June 9, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations and offered explanatory comments for each. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After 
a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 62-year-old who came to the U.S. in 1964 from India to study. He has an MBA and a Master's degree in physics. He became a citizen in 1982. 
He has been a successful businessman working in software engineering having founded his own company now employing 36 persons. He served as President, 
Chief Executive Officer while holding a majority share of the corporate stock. He has been recognized for his business acumen and contributions to the city 
where the company is located. The company does commercial as well as government work for several federal agencies.</P> 
<P>He founded another company in India that works as a subsidiary of the U.S. company on commercial work largely for Indian subsidiaries of U.S. companies. It 
is a member company of Software Technology Parks of India, an autonomous non-profit society under the Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology of the Government of India, that promotes and facilitates software exports from India. He also founded an institute in India that honors a pioneer 
software engineer and provides training and consulting to the Indian software industry. Applicant's U.S. company owns nearly all of the stock of the institute. 
Neither of his Indian organizations is profitable. Applicant also founded a consortium of 240 programmers involved in software development of which his 
Indian subsidiary is a member.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's parents-in-law and brother and sister-in-law are all citizens of and live in India. He is the sole owner of rental property in India valued at 
$100,000.00 and the owner with other </P> 
<P>family members of five acres of agricultural property. He has a bank account in India and traveled there 3l times between 1996 and 2003. Three Indian citizens 
work as managers for his U.S. company. </P> 
<P>When the issue in this case arose Applicant divested himself of ownership of a majority interest in his U.S. company and installed a U.S. citizen employee as 
president who was a witness for him in the hearing. By board resolution he has no access to classified work of the company. Applicant's son was given shares 
of stock by Applicant and he is now the largest shareholder in the company with 32%. The son is a Ph.D candidate at a major U.S. university and is not 
involved in the business or in the subject matter of Applicant's business, software engineering. Applicant has taken a lesser role in the U.S. company as a result 
of this case and serves as director of global development. Also, he has resigned as a director of, and reduced his activities in, the Indian subsidiary and the other 
Indian organizations in which he has founded and been active.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are 
not citizens of the United States</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information." 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1. Having  immediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a disqualifying security concern. 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable Guidelines cited in the SOR concerning Outside Activities-Guideline L provides as disqualifying conditions (DC) involvement in certain types 
of outside employment or activities if they pose a conflict with an individual's security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. (E2.Al21.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include any service, whether 
compensated, volunteer, or employment with a foreign country;<STRONG> </STRONG>any foreign national; a representative of any foreign interest; (E2.A12.1.2.1, 2, and 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC) include: <STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>1 Evaluation of the outside employment or activity indicates that it does not pose a conflict with an individual's security responsibilities; (E2.A12.1.3.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>2 The individual terminates the employment or discontinues the activity upon being notified that it is in conflict with his or her security responsibilities. 
(E2.A12.1.3.2.)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable guideline concerning foreign influence (Guideline B) provides as a disqualifying condition (DC) that a security risk may exist when an 
individual's family and foreign associates to whom he has close ties of affection or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. 
(E2.A2.1.1.) Such facts could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Possible mitigating conditions (MC) that might 
be applicable are a determination that the family members and associates in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S. (E2.A2.1.3.1.), or that foreign financial 
interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities. (E2.A2.1.3.5.)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's business continues to operate with new management and a lesser role for him. However, it is not at all clear that with a security clearance 
Applicant's role as leader of the company would not resume notwithstanding changes in titles. His son is the current owner of the controlling shares of stock 
once owned by Applicant who gave him the shares. The current president is beholden to Applicant for the position he now holds. Applicant is impressive as an 
entrepreneur and aggressive businessman. He has done very well with the company and has established links with his country of origin through a variety of 
enterprises. The fact that the Indian companies are not now making a profit does not mitigate the concerns that these are foreign based entities and pose a 
continuing problem in view of the type of work performed by the parent U.S. company. The changes in ownership and management to insulate him from the 
classified work of the company may be successful but to grant him a clearance based on these actions would be to ignore the reality of the history of the 
company, his strong leadership, and the fact that the controlling shares are held in the family by someone who has no professional interest in the company or 
ability to provide direction to it. No mitigating conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's family members who remain in India present a continuing problem under Guideline B as does ownership in rental property of significant value. No 
mitigating conditions are applicable as to the family members. The agricultural property is of little concern in view of the multiple family owners and the 
minimal value of Applicant's interest. So too is the mere existence of a bank account and the fact that his U.S. company has three Indian nationals on the 
payroll since there was no evidence of how this account was used and what these individuals do for the company.  Mitigating conditions are applicable to those 
allegations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P>
