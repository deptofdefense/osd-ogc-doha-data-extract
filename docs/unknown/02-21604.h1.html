<P>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He has taken virtually no action to contact  the creditors and pay off his debts. Based on his tenuous 
financial situation and his  history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his finances. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant 
knew or should have known that the financial information that he provided to the Government on a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was materially 
incorrect and incomplete.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On October 9, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>November 24, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on 
a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 2, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on February 13, 2004, and the hearing was held on March 15, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 5), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered  no 
documentary exhibits, but offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on March 30, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains seven allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., under Guideline F, and two allegation, 2.a. and 2.b., under</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E</SPAN>. 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all of the SOR factual allegations, except 1.b. and 1.c. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as a finding of fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48 year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN> He is separated from his wife, and they have a nine year 
old son. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> is a high school graduate.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> lists six debts that Applicant owed as of May 9, 2003, 1.a. through 1.f under Adjudicative Guideline F.  Based on his response to the SOR, the total 
amount owed by Applicant was approximately $5,600. These debts were all long overdue, most for several years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts will be discussed in the order that 
they were listed in the SOR:   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. This credit card debt to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $2,153. Applicant testified that he has made no payment on this debt, and he 
currently owes the full amount stated </SPAN>(TR at 17, 18).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. This debt to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $80. Applicant testified that this debt, for a delinquent parking ticket, has been resolved. He paid this debt in 
approximately 1998 to remove any restrictions from his motor vehicle (TR at 18, 19). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. This debt to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $23. Applicant testified that this debt, also for a delinquent parking ticket, has been resolved. He paid this debt in 
approximately 1998 to remove any restrictions from his motor vehicle (TR at 18, 19). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. This credit card debt to Creditor 3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $2,570. Applicant testified that he has made no payment on this debt, and he 
currently owes the full amount stated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 19).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. This debt to Creditor 4</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for cable television services is listed in the SOR in the amount of $80. Applicant testified that he has made no payment on this debt, 
and he currently owes the full amount stated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 19-21).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. This debt to Creditor 5, a department store, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $810. Applicant testified that he has made no payment on this debt, and he currently owes 
the full amount stated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 21).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. The SOR alleges that, based on a Personal Financial Statement, completed by Applicant on April 8, 2002, he would have no disposable income to resolve 
his debts. Applicant testified that based on a more current Personal Financial Statement, prepared on May 16, 2003, he now has $360 a month remaining to pay 
off his debts (TR at 31-34, Exhibit 4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consulted a credit counseling service after beginning the security clearance process, but he never availed himself of their services. In a sworn 
statement made by Applicant to the Defense Security Service (DSS) on April 8, 2002, he stated that since he is now employed, he planned to contact the 
creditors to attempt to arrange a payment plan (Exhibit 2). However, at the hearing, Applicant testified that, even though he has been aware of the 
Government's interest in resolving his debts, and despite his statement to the DSS, he did not want to start paying off these debts until he knew for certain that 
he could retain this current job. Therefore, as of the date of the hearing, he had taken no steps to resolve any of these debts (TR at 28, 29) .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a signed, sworn <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> on August 28, 2001.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Question #38 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been over 
180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> answered, "Yes" to this question and listed only one debt, which is the debt included on the SOR as 1.a. 
(Exhibit 1). Clearly, at the time he completed the SCA, </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was or had been delinquent on all the other debts listed on the SOR, and he should have 
included all of these debts .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #39 asks,  "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> answered, "Yes" to this question and again listed only the one debt, 
</SPAN>which he had included in his response to question #38 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 1)</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time he completed the SCA, </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was still delinquent on the debts listed as 1.d, 
1.e, and 1.f.,on the SOR, and he should have included all of these debts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's explanation for his responses was that he did not recall, or was not sure, what debts he actually owed<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He testified, "The other creditors, I hadn't 
heard from them for a while. I assumed they probably got repaid from the bank I guessed. Whatever." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 25). </SPAN><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines and concerns most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of 
this case: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines F and E:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. The evidence shows that Applicant has 
had some funds available to pay off his debts, yet he has taken virtually no action to contact  the creditors and pay off these debts. Based on his tenuous 
financial situation and his  history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his finances.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>I, therefore,  
resolve Guideline F against Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN>under Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history 
of not meeting financial obligations and his unwillingness to satisfy his debts. I find that none of the Mitigating Conditions (MC)  apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided inaccurate information to the Government in response to two questions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#38 and 
#39,</SPAN> on the SCA that he executed in August 2001.  I conclude that when Applicant answered the SCA, he knew or should have known that he had several long 
overdue debts, and he should have furnished this information to the Government. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN>applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because the information </SPAN>that Applicant provided to 
the Government, in his SCA, was known or should have been known by him to be <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an omission of relevant and material </SPAN>facts.  No Mitigating Conditions (MC) 
apply.</P>
