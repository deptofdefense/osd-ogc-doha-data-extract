<P>Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey-Anderson issued a decision, dated September 25,1998, in which she concluded it is
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant
appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 29, 1998 to Applicant.  The
SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations) and Criterion E (Personal Conduct).</P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he stated "I wish to have a decision without a hearing."  A File of
Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared, and Applicant was provided with a copy of the FORM.  Applicant did not
submit a response to the FORM.  The case was then assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination.  The Judge
subsequently issued a written decision in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P>On September 25, 1998, the Administrative Judge's decision was mailed to Applicant through his employer's address. 
The decision was returned, undelivered.</P>

<P>On November 16, 1998, the Board received a letter from Applicant seeking to appeal the Administrative Judge's adverse
decision.  The presence of the returned decision in the case file corroborated Applicant's assertion that he had not received
the Judge's decision.  Accordingly, the Chairman accepted Applicant's late notice of appeal, and sent him a copy of the
Judge's decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="98-0291.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a history of financial irresponsibility that began about seven years
earlier and continued up to June 1998.  The Judge found that Applicant had recently satisfied various small debts, but that
he still had not satisfied two civil judgments (totaling approximately $36,000) entered against him in June 1994 and
August 1994 for violating the terms of a constructive trust.  The Judge noted the seriousness of Applicant's misconduct in
violating the terms of the constructive trust, which deprived his two minor nephews of life insurance proceeds intended
for their benefit.  The Judge found Applicant had failed to present evidence of rehabilitation and concluded he had failed
to overcome the security implications of his proven misconduct.</P>

<P>Applicant makes the following arguments on appeal: (a) the Administrative Judge erred by  finding that he did not make
payments toward two outstanding civil judgments (totaling more than $35,000) entered against him in June 1994 and
August 1994; and (b) Applicant "feel[s] badly" about his "big mistake" and plans to pay "what [he] can pay to fulfill the
judgement, and give back to the children what is due to them."  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue
of whether the Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Considering the record as a whole, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for finding Applicant had failed to make
payments to satisfy the civil judgments entered against him.  There is no record evidence that Applicant made any
payments toward satisfying the civil judgments against him.  (Applicant's assertions to the contrary on appeal are not
record evidence.)  In January 1998, Applicant told a government investigator that he still owed  approximately $36,000 on
the civil judgments (FORM, Gov. Ex. 7).  Furthermore, as late as June 1998, Applicant admitted the judgments were still
outstanding and he was trying to contact a lawyer to set up a monthly payment plan (FORM, Gov. Ex. 3).  A promise to
make payments in the future is not evidence that would justify a finding by the Judge that Applicant has made payments
toward satisfying the civil judgments against him.</P>

<P>The record evidence supports the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's financial misconduct and the civil
judgments against him arising out of that misconduct.  Given the evidence of Applicant's financial misconduct, Applicant
had the burden of presenting evidence "to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven
by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge had a rational basis for
concluding Applicant failed to meet that burden.</P>

<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to
classified information.  Applicant's financial misconduct provided a rational basis for the Administrative Judge's negative
conclusions about Applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness and her overall adverse security clearance
decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative
Judge's September 25, 1998 decision.</P>
