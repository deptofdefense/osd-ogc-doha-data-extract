<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 21 February 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-31606.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-31606.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its 
decision-Applicant failed to meet the foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B) personnel security guidelines of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 18 March 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 9 June 
2003.  On 24 July 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 1 August 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father was born in Turkey.  Ex. 1 at 6.  He came to the U.S. around 1960 to attend college.  After graduating and obtaining an advanced degree, he 
stayed in the U.S. where he worked as an engineer.  Ex. 2 at 1.  Applicant's father married a U.S. citizen and Applicant was born in the U.S. in 1974.  Ex. 1 at 
1, 6; Ex. 2 at 1; Tr. 23.  In 1980, Applicant's family moved to Turkey for two years while his father taught at a university there.  The entire family returned to 
the U.S. in 1982 and his father continued teaching.  Ex. 2 at 2.</P> 
 
<P>Around 1985, the marriage fell apart and Applicant's parents eventually divorced.  Applicant's mother married a native-born U.S. citizen.  Applicant's father 
married a Turkish citizen residing in the U.S.  Applicant's father became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1987; his stepmother became a U.S. citizen in 1997.  Ex. 
2 at 2; Ex. 1 at 6.  Applicant's father, step-mother, siblings, and step-siblings hold dual citizenship in the U.S. and Turkey.  Ex. 1 at 6-7.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant resides in the U.S. with the mother of his son.  The son was born in the U.S. in 2001.  Applicant claims the child is a dual citizen of the U.S. and 
Turkey.  Ex. 2 at 4; Ex. 1 at 7.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has one grandparent and two step-grandparents, two aunts, and one uncle who are citizens and residents of Turkey.  Another aunt and uncle are 
Turkish citizens who currently reside in Germany.  Tr. 20.  Applicant talks to his step-mother's parents via telephone once every two months.  He talks to his 
father's mother once every month and his aunts and uncles less frequently.  Ex. 2 at 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents obtained a Turkish passport for him when he was a child, and Applicant caused it to be renewed in 1998.  Applicant traveled to Turkey 
several times with his family while he was a child on his Turkish passport.  On those occasions, his father would handle the passports.  Tr. 32; Ex. 2 at 4.  
Applicant did not travel on his Turkish passport after 1994.  In August 2002, Applicant took his fianc&eacute;e and son to Turkey to meet his relatives there, he used 
his U.S. passport.  Tr. 33; Ex. 2 at 4.  On 24 July 2003, prior to the start of the hearing, Applicant mailed his Turkish passport to the Turkish Consulate.  Tr. 30.</P> 
 
<P>As a male Turkish citizen, Applicant is obligated to serve 18 months of military service.  In 1994, Applicant's father and cousin went to Turkish government 
officials in Turkey, on Applicant's behalf and with his knowledge, requesting Applicant be granted an extension of the service requirements.  Applicant was 
granted an extension until he is 39 years old.  Because Applicant resides in a NATO member country, he may fulfill his military obligation to Turkey by serving 
in a U.S. military reserve unit.  Ex. 2 at 4.  Applicant originally intended to fulfill his Turkish military obligation by so serving in a U.S. reserve unit.  <EM>Id</EM>.  
However, he now intends to pay the $10,000 fine instead.  Tr. 19.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant "would be willing to comply with an obligation to serve or to bear arms on behalf of Turkey depending on the cause."  Ex. 2 at 4.  "If [Applicant] 
believe[s] a cause is worth fighting for, [he] is willing to bear arms on behalf of that country, no matter which country it is."  Tr. 18-19.  He is "willing to bear 
arms for a cause which I believe in, no matter what the country."  Tr. 19.  He would not bear arms for Turkey against the U.S.  Tr. 37.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has no financial interests in Turkey and has not received any tangible benefits from the Turkish government, other than the passport he used.  He has 
never voted in any foreign election  Tr. 17, 27; Ex. 2 at 5.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has expressed his reluctance to renounce his Turkish citizenship.  "I am not willing to renounce my Turkish citizenship as a condition of access to 
classified information."  Ex. 2 at 4.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Turkey (&para;1.a.), possessed a Turkish passport (&para; 1.b.), was willing to bear arms on behalf 
of Turkey (&para; 1.c.), intended to serve his Turkish military obligation by serving in a reserve unit of the U.S. military (&para; 1.d.), and contacted Turkish government 
authorities in Turkey regarding his passport and compulsory, military service extension (&para; 1.e.).  An applicant who acts in such a way as to indicate a preference 
for a foreign country over the U.S. may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interest of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence, and Applicant's admissions, that Applicant exercised dual citizenship (DC 1), possessed and used a 
foreign passport (DC 2), and expressed a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country (DC 3) and to fulfill, in some way his Turkish military service 
obligation.  Applicant contends that his dual citizenship is based solely on his father's citizenship (MC 1) and suggests his ties to Turkey are part of his cultural 
heritage (Ex. 2 at 4). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Without a doubt, the source of Applicant's Turkish citizenship is his father's Turkish citizenship.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an 
adverse security clearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454, 2000 DOHA LEXIS 221 at **14-15 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  It is the exercise of that 
citizenship that is the disqualifying condition.  DC 1.  Applicant was not just a dual citizen.  He exercised his Turkish citizenship by possessing his Turkish 
passport without the sanction of the U.S. Government.<A HREF="02-31606.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Although he turned his passport into the Turkish Consulate, he did so reluctantly, only on the date of 
the hearing and under threat of disqualification.  <EM>See</EM> Memo. from Arthur L. Money, Asst. Secretary of Defense, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication 
Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline </EM>(Aug. 16, 2000).  The so-called "Money Memo" requires that any 
security clearance be denied or revoked "unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency 
of the United States Government."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's bonds to Turkey are, in some measure, a reflection of his respect for his Turkish heritage.  Evidence of a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">foreign preference must go "beyond mere 
sentiment, respect for his [foreign] heritage, or symbolism."  ISCR Case No. 99-0454, 2000 DOHA LEXIS 221 at *16 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  And in this 
case, Applicant's affinity for Turkey is more than just respect and interest in the country from which his forbears emigrated.  Instead, it represents such a close 
tie that Applicant is willing to serve in the Turkish armed forces or pay a $10,000 fine to the Turkish Government to avoid such service.  Although the means 
by which Applicant now claims he intends to fulfill his Turkish military commitment have changed (paying the $10,000 fine rather than performing substitute 
service in a U.S. military reserve unit), his underlying intention to do so has not.  Therefore, Under the circumstances, the finding is against Applicant on &para; 1 
and all its subparagraphs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father, stepmother, sibling, step-siblings, and son are dual citizens of Turkey and the U.S. and reside in the U.S. (&para; 2.a.), 
three grandparents, three aunts, and an uncle are citizens and residents of Turkey (&para; 2.b.), and he traveled to Turkey in 1994 and 2002, and prior to 1994, every 
two years (&para; 2.c.).  A security risk may exist when members of an applicant's immediate family, and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence, and Applicant's admissions, that members of his immediate family who reside in the U.S. are dual U.S.-Turkish citizens.  DC 1.  The Government also established that members of Applicant's extended family are Turkish citizens living abroad.  DC 1.  Applicant 
asserts these relatives are not agents of a foreign power (MC 1) and his contacts with them are casual and infrequent (MC 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's relationship with his immediate family members and foreign relatives cannot be divorced from his foreign preference for Turkey over the U.S.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-12452 at 4 (Jan. 27, 2003) (holding, under the whole person concept, it would be arbitrary and capricious for an administrative judge to 
consider conduct in isolation from other conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's relatives are important to him.  The evidence established that Applicant's father and step-mother 
are still very much involved in Turkey.  They return to Turkey for two months every summer.  Ex. 2 at 5.  Applicant talks to his grandparents frequently on the 
telephone and visited these relatives in Turkey to show them his young son.  Under all the circumstances of this case, it is clear that Applicant does have close 
ties of affection and obligation to his grandparents.  DC 1.  While there is no evidence that these relatives are agents of a foreign power, Applicant failed to 
demonstrate that his relatives are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power or that his contacts with them are casual and infrequent under the 
circumstances of this case.  Finding is against Applicant on &para;&para; 2.a. - 2.c.</SPAN></P>
