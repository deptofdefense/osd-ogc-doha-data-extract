<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's credit report includes eleven accounts, totaling approximately $13,000.00, that have been delinquent for as long as nine years. He attributes most of 
the accounts to his mother having incurred debt using his name. Applicant has done absolutely nothing to resolve the situation, and instead exhibits complete 
financial irresponsibility. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by the financial considerations present in this case. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline F, financial considerations, based upon eleven delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $13,000.00. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on September 8, 2003. He admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR, and 
requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on December 23, 2003. A notice of hearing was issued January 28, 2004, scheduling the hearing for February 23, 2004.  The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted 
into the record without an objection. Applicant testified at the hearing but did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript March 17, 
2004.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 28-years-old, married, and the father of a three-year-old child. He has been employed by a defense contractor, first as a janitor and now as a mail 
specialist, since August 2000. Applicant and his wife's combined incomes total approximately $25,000.00 per year. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant graduated from high school in May 1994, and attended a junior college until May 1996. He worked as a bookkeeper for his father's logging business 
from June 1994 until April 1998, as a press oiler for a box company from April 1998 until May 1998, and was unemployed from May 1998 until July 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's credit reports list eleven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $13,000.00. Two of the accounts are repossessions, one is a television cable 
bill, and the balance appear to be credit card debt that has either been submitted for collection or charged off as bad debt. The majority of the accounts have 
been delinquent since between 1995 and 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant acknowledges he is responsible for one automobile repossession account, charged off as a bad debt in the amount of $3,559.00 in July 1995. He has 
made no effort to resolve this account. He claims the remaining delinquent accounts were incurred by his mother using his name to obtain credit without his 
permission. Applicant included a notarized note from his mother with his response to financial interrogatories in which she accepted responsibility for incurring 
the debts. However, whether or not the debts are actually his responsibility, Applicant has been aware these debts were listed as his liabilities since 1999 and 
has done nothing to deal with them.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a statement to a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on June 6, 2002 in which he indicated both he and his mother 
lacked the financial ability to pay off the debts. He expressed an intention to file bankruptcy within a couple of months. He responded to financial 
interrogatories on May 7, 2003, and stated he would probably file bankruptcy sometime in the future. He testified at the hearing that it was his intention to file 
bankruptcy when he got everything together.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access 
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="02-22892.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's  has substantial delinquent debt, vis-a-vis his income, that remains outstanding.  While he attributes most of the debt to his mother, he has not taken 
any steps to resolve the delinquent accounts, including the nine-year-old automobile repossession deficiency he admits belongs to him. Based on all the 
evidence presented in this case, I find Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been aware of the delinquent accounts for at least the past five years, and has been aware they were of concern in granting him a security 
clearance since at least the time of the DSS interview in June 2002. He has repeatedly acknowledged he lacks the resources to satisfy the accounts and claimed 
he would file for bankruptcy protection. To date he has done nothing. I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none apply.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 
6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant is unable to mitigate this security concern.  He has failed to 
overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
