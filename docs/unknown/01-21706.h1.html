<P>Applicant's<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> multiple minor traffic offenses, alcohol-related arrests, and other miscellaneous misconduct casts serious doubt on his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Although he stopped drinking 15 months ago, record evidence is insufficient to conclude that he will not return to alcohol abuse. Clearance 
denied.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>3 October 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On </SPAN>30 
October 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to two different Administrative Judges, but the case was  
reassigned to me </SPAN>on 9 January 2003 because of case load considerations, and received by me the same day. On 16 January 2003, I issued a Notice of Hearing 
(NOH) for a hearing on 3 February 2003.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the government presented fourteen exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented five exhibits--also admitted 
without objection--and his testimony. DOHA received the transcript on 13 February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR except subparagraphs 1. s. and 2.a.<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>; accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of 
fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he has held since approximately 1993.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of minor traffic offenses interspersed with three alcohol-related arrests and an auto theft charge between March 1987 and October 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between March 1987 and October 1999, Applicant was stopped, cited, charged, and/or arrested on 16 occasions, resulting in 32 separate charges.<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> With the 
exception of DUI arrests in November 1998, December 1996, October 1990, and the auto theft charge in March 1987, the traffic stops all represent variations 
on a theme: Applicant is stopped for a comparatively minor traffic offense (running a light or stop sign; illegal turn; speeding). Once stopped, he is found to 
have no valid driver's license (valid license not in possession; suspended or revoked because of failure to pay required liability insurance; suspended or revoked 
due to DUI conviction), and/or no valid safety inspection, and/or no proof of liability insurance (valid insurance not in possession; expired), and/or not wearing 
seatbelts. He is then typically fined, and occasionally confined to jail for a few days; the license, insurance, and inspection citations are usually dismissed once 
Applicant produces his valid license, renews his insurance, and get his car inspected. Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment in these paper offenses (Tr. 
39). Since getting his driver's license, he has lived in states that require you to drive with your license in your possession, have valid liability insurance on your 
car, and obtain periodic safety inspections (Tr. 56-62).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1987, Applicant was arrested for auto theft when he used "self help" to repossess an automobile stolen from him about a year earlier.<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> However, 
although Applicant had apparently not reported the car stolen, no formal charges were brought against him. In October 1990, Applicant was arrested for DUI 
after being stopped for doing 68 mph in a 35 mph zone. Although he failed a field sobriety test, and provided two breath samples that tested over the state-limit 
.01% B.A.C., Applicant was acquitted of DUI in jury trial. However, he was convicted of speeding.<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> In December 1996, Applicant was again arrested for DUI, 
but refused to take the required breath test. He was given deferred judgment, one-year supervised probation, and ordered to complete an alcohol safety course, 
which he did. In November 1998, he had his third DUI. He pleaded nolo contendere and was given 30-days, suspended, fined $200.00, and ordered to attend 
outpatient alcohol awareness courses. Again he complied with the sentence requirements (G.E. 3; A.E. C).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Throughout his earlier background investigations, Applicant has minimized his alcohol abuse issues.<A HREF="01-21706.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He continued that trend in his latest investigation (G.E. 
2) when he stated that he thought he had an alcohol problem, but nevertheless continued to drink. During his 1994 background investigation, he minimized the 
seriousness of his minor traffic offenses when he falsely claimed to have not been given any jail time as a result of theses citations (G.E. 6). He later 
acknowledged that this was a lie (G.E. 7). However, his clearance was continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant produced documents demonstrating his satisfactory work record (A.E. A, D) and financial responsibility (A.E. B). However, he also 
produced a current police record A.E. E) that corroborated most of the government's allegations of minor traffic offenses as well as documenting that he had 
another minor traffic citation (with no valid state inspection) in late January 2001. He testified that he had decided to stop drinking on his 40<SUP>th</SUP> birthday in 
November 2001 because of the adverse effects it had in his life. However, he was not involved in any support groups, and acknowledged that he had stopped 
drinking in the past only to return to it later on (Tr. 48). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.1. Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (GUIDELINE G)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1. The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of  questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and 
increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information die to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents 
related to alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3.2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3.3. Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to 
Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant's pattern of minor traffic offenses, alcohol-related arrests, and other miscellaneous 
misconduct casts serious doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Although he has previously been granted a clearance despite this misconduct, 
the misconduct has continued since 1987. In this regard, his 1994 falsification has security significance not so much as a falsification, but as part of the larger 
pattern of poor judgment. The three alcohol-related arrests are the most serious of the misconduct, and only confirm my doubts about Applicant's fitness for 
access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline G, and the alcohol abuse is not mitigated. The record reflects that Applicant has three alcohol-related 
arrests within a ten-year period 1990-1999, and continued to drink well into 2001 notwithstanding his recognition that it was causing him problems. Deciding to 
stop drinking on his 40<SUP>th</SUP> birthday (15 months ago) is a positive sign, but one that does not completely mitigate the concern because Applicant demonstrates little 
true insight into his problem and does not appear to have any support system in place to ensure that he does not return to drinking or engage in alcohol-related 
misconduct. Insufficient time has passed to ensure that Applicant will not resume drinking. Thus, I am unable to conclude that Applicant is unlikely to return to 
drinking. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline G against  Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996, and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Although Applicant asserted--and the record evidence confirms--that the arrests listed at 1.d. and f. (1998) and 1.k. and l. (1996) are duplicate entries. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>In addition, he was orally reprimanded by his employer for a security violation in approximately 1988. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Although Applicant asserted that the car had been stolen from him about six months before his "self-help" repossession and had reported it stolen to the 
police at the time of the original theft, the police report (G.E. 14) reflects that Applicant did not report the car stolen, and the complainant in the 1987 arrest had 
purchased it for value (from the putative thief) over a year before March 1987. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Notwithstanding the jury finding on Applicant's criminal responsibility, I conclude that this arrest constitutes an alcohol-related arrest within meaning of the 
Directive. Applicant's claimed level of alcohol consumption (3-4 beers) is inconsistent with the record alcohol content and failed sobriety tests.
