<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant falsified a questionnaire by not admitting that he had plead "no contest" to Assault in 2000 in connection with a child custody dispute.  He 
mitigated the security significance of the Assault itself, but not the intentional falsification.  Adverse inference is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 13, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on September 8, 2003, 
and a Notice of Hearing was issued on the same date.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on September 25, 2003, at which the Government presented seven  documentary exhibits, and called one witness.  Testimony was taken 
from the Applicant, who called one additional witness and also submitted 20 exhibits.  The transcript was received on October 6, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 51, divorced and has a Master's degree in Management Information Systems.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an 
Avionics/Electrical Engineer, and he seeks to retain a Secret-level DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense 
sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits 
and the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early 2000, the Applicant's wife left him and took their three children.  The Applicant could not find his wife, who had left the children with her mother.  On 
ay 3, 2000, based on the advice of his counsel, the Applicant decided to take back custody of his children from his mother-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During a previously arranged visit with his children at a park, the Applicant asked them if they would like to go home.  The children agreed.  The mother-in-law 
found out about his plan and objected strenuously.  The Applicant began carrying his three year old son to his car.  While he was walking, the 77 year old 
mother-in-law followed behind, holding his shirt, yelling and attempting to strike the Applicant.  During this walk, the mother-in-law fell down and severely 
hurt herself.  That is not in dispute.  What is in dispute is how she fell.  She states that the Applicant pushed her down, the Applicant vehemently disagrees and 
says that she fell attempting to strike him. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The police were called after the Applicant left the area and a police report was prepared.  Based on that report, and the statements of the mother-in-law and her 
children, the Applicant was charged by the county district attorney with Elder Abuse, Battery and Child Endangerment.  As part of the criminal case, the 
Applicant was booked and fingerprinted by the local police department.  (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 12, 2000, the Applicant, pursuant to a plea agreement, plead no contest to a charge of Assault.  He received a fine and one year's court probation.  
The other three charges were dismissed.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5; Applicant Exhibits A through L, Transcript at 47-52.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the same time as the criminal case was proceeding, the mother-in-law had filed a civil action to obtain a Domestic Violence Prevention Order against the 
Applicant.  (Applicant's Exhibit N.)  A hearing on this petition was held on September 1, 2000, during which the Applicant testified.  (Applicant's Exhibit M.)  
On September 12, 2000, a stipulation was agreed to in this case whereby both parties agreed to avoid the other whenever possible.  (Applicant's Exhibit Q.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the above two actions, in 2001 the mother-in-law also filed a civil suit against the Applicant.  That suit asked for money damages against the 
Applicant.  This suit was dismissed in April 2002.  (Applicant's Exhibit T.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 5, 2001, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he answered "No," to the following question:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the last 7 years, have your been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?  (Leave out traffic fines 
of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been 
"sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act 
for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  (Government Exhibit 1, question 26.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This statement was a false answer to a material question pertaining to the Applicant's criminal record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was subsequently interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in October 2001.  In that first interview the Applicant 
informed the Special Agent that he was being sued by his mother-in-law in a civil suit.  This referred to the suit filed in 2001.  The Applicant did not tell the 
Special Agent about the criminal case or the suit for the issuance of a restraining order.  The Special Agent subsequently found out about those two cases 
through her investigation.  (Transcript at 27-29.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was subsequently re-interviewed on January 7, 2002.  A sworn statement was taken in which the Applicant stated:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When I was previously interviewed by DSS on 12 Oct 01 and 17 Oct 01, I disclosed the information regarding this [May 3, 2000] incident but was not 
completely forthcoming in explaining the results of said incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.      .      . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I did not list these charges or discuss them in previous interviews because I didn't think that when I plea bargained to a lesser charge of "no contest" that I was 
plea bargaining to a criminal offense.  I have never been in a court room prior to this, have never been in any trouble with the law, and I am very naive to the 
whole process.  When I previously discussed this incident and said I never heard from the police again, that was true.  I was not arrested, but I was notified by 
mail that charges were being filed against me.  I realize now that I should have listed this incident and should have disclosed that I was charged and plea 
bargained to an assault charge.  I discussed the incident openly at my prior interviews and know that records would be checked and did not intentionally attempt 
to conceal this information.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 1-2, Transcript at 39-40.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Applicant testified that he answered "No" because he did not know that he was being charged with a crime, that he didn't feel he needed to 
report the charges because they were not true, that he did not realize that he had to admit his "no contest" plea, that he did not know his plea to Assault was a 
plea to a criminal offense, and that he did not think his criminal record was "significant."  (Transcript at 44, 53, 60 and 74.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted several character reference letters from current and former co-workers.  (Applicant's Exhibit R.)  They describe the Applicant as a 
man of high moral character, one who is honest, trustworthy and exhibits integrity.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Exhibit S consists of a number of work-related certificates.  They show that the Applicant is respected at his job, including being named Employee 
of the Year in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors and other acquaintances;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in criminal conduct or acts of falsification that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has a single serious criminal conviction on his 
record (Guideline J); and that he intentionally made false material statements to DoD (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  The Applicant's plea of "no contest" to Assault in 2000 was connected to the emotional turmoil surrounding his 
deteriorating marriage.  Based on the record, it is clear that this was an aberrational event that occurred three years before the record closed.  There has been no 
repeat of this conduct.  The Applicant has mitigated this allegation and Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  I have examined the Applicant's explanations 
for his falsification on the questionnaire and find all of them wanting.  The Applicant is an intelligent man, with a Master's degree.  He retained counsel to 
represent him in a criminal case.  It is simply not credible that he could believe he did not have to admit this criminal record on his questionnaire.  His list of 
explanations and excuses, in my opinion, show him to be a man who read the question in the narrowest fashion to allow him to answer "no."  The question was 
relevant, material and asked in a way that was understandable to any reasonable person.  The Applicant, for whatever reason, attempted to deceive the 
Government about his record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's credibility on this point is affected by several factors.  The Applicant's answer to question 40 on the questionnaire was also false, in that he did 
not admit that he had a civil action filed against him.  In addition, he mislead the DoD investigator by not fully disclosing information about his criminal case 
and the civil suit that he knew, or should have known, was relevant.  Finally, his hearing testimony was contradictory and confusing.  It is the Applicant's 
burden to show that he was truthful and/or that he has mitigated any falsification.  He has failed to do so.  Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  
As set forth above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
