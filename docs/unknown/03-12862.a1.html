  A decision by a Hearing Office Administrative Judge is not legally binding precedent that other Hearing Office Judges must follow.  The application of the Adjudicative Guidelines requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  The Judge's failure to make findings of fact  pertinent to the Guideline F issues of the case was error, but that error was harmless because the Judge's decision is sustainable on other grounds.  The Judge's  finding of falsification is sustainable.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Alan V. Edmunds, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 22, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated December 7, 2004.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's history of financial difficulties was not 
extenuated or mitigated, and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate.  
For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's history of financial difficulties was not extenuated or mitigated</SPAN>.<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant contends the 
Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by his substantial indebtedness were mitigated by application of Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In support of that contention Applicant argues that: (1) he had either paid off, was making payments on, or 
had contacted creditors to make settlement arrangements with respect to, many of the debts, (2) subsequent to the hearing, but before the closing of the record in 
the case, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and (3) his financial situation was adversely impacted by his divorce and his child's medical condition.  Applicant 
also cites to several decisions by DOHA Administrative Judges in which security clearances were granted to applicants with financial histories similar to 
Applicant's.  Applicant's claims have mixed merit.</P> 
<P>The decision in another DOHA case cited by Applicant on appeal does not demonstrate error by the Administrative Judge in this case.  A decision by a Hearing 
Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge's colleagues in other cases.  The cited cases are not legally binding precedent on the Board in this or 
any other appeal.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-22606 (June 30, 2003) at pp. 3-5 (discussing in detail the precedential value of decisions by Hearing Office Judges).</P> 
<P>The application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition by an Administrative Judge requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as 
a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) at p. 7.  Accordingly, even if Applicant's financial difficulties arose from circumstances 
beyond his control, the Judge reasonably could consider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner more recently when dealing with those financial 
difficulties. </P> 
<P>In this case, the Judge found and the record supports Applicant had a pattern of procrastination and half measures with regard to dealing with many years of 
significant debts, including debts for unpaid taxes and student loans.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, he still had significant delinquent debts 
and had only recently filed for bankruptcy.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant's financial problems were ongoing and 
that Applicant's recent efforts to rectify his financial situation were not a substitute for a consistent record of timely remedial action.  Therefore, the Judge was 
not required as a matter of law to conclude Applicant's efforts to address his financial difficulties warranted application of Financial Considerations Mitigating 
Conditions 6.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge did not make any findings with respect to Applicant's divorce, the medical condition of Applicant's child, or the relation of either of 
those circumstances to Applicant's financial situation.<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In his conclusion, the Judge confused Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions 2<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and 3, stating: 
"No Mitigating Conditions (MC) have been established . . . it is not an isolated incident (MC 3); . . ."<A HREF="03-12862.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Given the facial significance of Applicant's divorce and 
his child's medical condition to his case in mitigation, the Judge erred in not making pertinent findings of fact and conclusions as required by the Directive.  <EM>See</EM> 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25.  However, because the Judge's ultimate adverse decision is sustainable on other grounds (Guideline 
E), remand to the Judge has no significant chance of changing the outcome of the case, and is therefore inappropriate.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-17276 (March 15, 
2005) at p.4.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that he 
did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by failing to disclose his Federal Income Tax liens.  Rather, he contends the omission of the 
information in question was the result of an oversight.  Applicant's argument does not persuade us that the Judge erred. </P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant's explanation for why he failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not 
bound--as a matter of law--to accept or reject Applicant's explanation.  Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant's explanation in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge had a sufficient basis to find that Applicant's omissions were deliberate and intentional.  
Accordingly, the Judge's finding of falsification is sustainable.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.</P>
