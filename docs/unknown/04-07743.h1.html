</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 8, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  By letter signed on April 1, 2005, Applicant admitted to the 
allegations listed under Guideline F, to two of the four allegations noted under Guideline E, and admitted in part, denied in part, the remaining two allegations 
set forth under Guideline E of the SOR.  He requested a determination without hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on March 8, 2005, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to Applicant.

signed for a copy of the FORM on June 27, 2005, and was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation, he chose to neither submit additional materials or argument, nor address the Motion to Amend.  I was assigned this case on August 24, 2005.  In the 
absence of any objection, I grant the Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted to all of the allegations in the SOR except for two sub-allegations, which he admits in part, denies in part.<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old employee who has worked as a supply technician for a government contractor since January 27, 2003.  His life experience includes 
20 years in the active military and a brief period of college-level instruction.  Applicant has been married for 19 years.  He has both a stepchild and a child, aged 
21 and 17, respectively. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant fell behind on his bills at a time during which he had several deployments to the Middle East, his wife assumed part-time employment,<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and he and 
his wife had just had a new born child.<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  No more is known of the origin of these obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, the debts that arose, remain, and are now at issue are:<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.a </STRONG>- A state tax lien for $358;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.b</STRONG> - A federal tax lien for $613;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.c</STRONG> - A debt owed (Bank A) that was put into collections in the amount of $109;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.d</STRONG> - A debt owed (Bank B) that was charged off in the amount of $3,189;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.e </STRONG>- A debt owed (Bank C) that was charged off in the amount of $481; and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.f </STRONG>- A debt owed (Bank D) that was charged off in the amount of $1,613.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to Personal Conduct, Applicant:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2.a</STRONG> - Falsified material facts on his SF 86 form by failing to disclose that tax liens had been placed against his property in the 7 years prior to his security 
clearance application;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2.b </STRONG>- Falsified material facts on his SF 86 form by failing to disclose that he had been 180 days delinquent on a debt or debts in the 7 years prior to his security 
clearance application, including those debts noted above as 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f, as well as -</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. a debt to a private label, military charge card (Bank E), and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ii. a debt to (Bank F);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2.c</STRONG> -Falsified material facts on his SF 86 form by failing to disclose that he was then 90 days delinquent on a debt or debts, including those debts cited above as 
1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f, as well as -   i. a debt to a private label, military charge card (Bank E), </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ii. a debt to (Bank F), and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">iii. A debt to (Bank G); and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2.d</STRONG> - Failed to disclose the negative financial information referenced above in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c, as referenced on his SF 86 as subparagraphs 2.a 
through 2.c, because he was afraid the negative information would adversely affect his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the obligation to Bank E, for a military charge card, stating that he had paid off this obligation in full with the proceeds from his 2002 tax 
refund, plus a small additional amount paid for by a money order dated October 3, 2002.  He does not, however, proffer any documentary evidence 
substantiating this claim in any way.  In contrast, Applicant admits to the remaining bank debts and the two liens.  Although in the past he has noted plans to 
make contact with his creditors, Applicant has provided no documentation or recent argument that might tend to indicate such contact or initiative ever 
transpired.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to the allegations concerning falsifications, Applicant admits the allegations.  Indeed, regarding the issue as to why he failed to disclose the 
negative financial information, he initially cites to his then-lack of access to his financial records when he made his security clearance application, then clearly 
enunciates his personal fear "that by reporting the financial information on the form that it would adversely affect (his security) clearance."<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it should be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN>. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG><EM>The Concern</EM>:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specific conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this 
adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits to both the two liens and to all but one of 
the debts (Bank E)<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> at issue.  Consequentially, I find that both Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>history of not 
meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 ([<EM>i</EM>]<EM>nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Government has met its burden with regard to Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant admits that because he feared the truth might 
negatively influence his security clearance, he deliberately gave untrue answers on his security clearance application which concealed material facts concerning 
his true financial situation.  Therefore, I find that Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to show that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.  Specifically, the burden shifts to the Applicant to move forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation, or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  As such, it is his ultimate burden to present sufficient evidence 
to mitigate the security concerns that the disqualifying conditions raise.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, however, Applicant has introduced nothing except the bald, unsubstantiated assertion that one of his debts, a military private-label credit card (Bank E), 
has been satisfied; he admits to the rest of the allegations contained within the SOR without comment.  As such, he has made no attempt and offered no 
evidence to mitigate any of the security concerns raised.  Given such a scant record upon which to examine, I am unable to find that any of the mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) or Guideline E (Personal Conduct) apply.<A HREF="04-07743.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered both the facts before me and the Applicant under the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature family man with two decades of military 
service to his country.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because he has failed in his burden to mitigate the security concerns that his finances and personal conduct raise, however, I find for the 
Government with regard to paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f, and paragraph 2, subparagraphs 2.a through 2.d, of the SOR.</SPAN></P>
