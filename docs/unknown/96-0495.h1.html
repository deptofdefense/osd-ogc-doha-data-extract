<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></P>

<P>On July 10, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed her
Answer to the SOR on September 4, 1996.</P>

<P>The case was received by the undersigned on December 2, 1996. A notice of hearing was issued on December 4, 1996, and the case was heard on December 12,
1996.  The Government  and Applicant submitted documentary evidence.<A HREF="96-0495.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript was received on December 23,
1996.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>

<P>The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony (Tr.). The SOR alleges financial
considerations (Criterion F). Applicant admitted all the factual allegations but disputed the amount of the debt in subparagraph 1c. She also answered she is a
loyal citizen, voter and juror. The loss of her job will cause her to return to unemployment.</P>

<P>Applicant is 44 years old and employed as a --------- by a defense contractor. She seeks a secret level clearance. </P>

<P>Applicant owes approximately $4,400 to an automobile manufacturer credit company. The account was charged off in December 1989. She voluntarily returned
the vehicle in 1988 when the manufacturer changed the terms of the lease.<A HREF="96-0495.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Applicant believes the second debt is for a phone bill she generated after she moved
in May 1991. (Tr. 29). Subparagraph 1c is for the second car that belonged to her present husband.<A HREF="96-0495.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> Applicant owes the debts identified in 1e, 1f and 1g and
was paying the finance company (subparagraphs 1c and 1f became one company) approximately $30 a week from January 1994 (when she returned to the local
area) to April or May 1994 when her continued unemployment required her to stop. (Tr. 31-33). Applicant's income is not sufficient to meet her debts. (GE #2).</P>

<P>In explanation of her financial problems, Applicant indicated her present husband was going through a long period of unemployment and she has been the sole
means of support for the family. (GE #2; Tr. 26). Her debts have resulted from inadequate earnings to extend to all creditors, and she has to pick the most
important debts to pay.<A HREF="96-0495.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>Applicant blamed the entire financial dilemma on moving to another state in May 1991 to take on a job, which would also have allowed her husband to be
closer to ------------------ opportunities. (Tr. 19).<A HREF="96-0495.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> Before the move, she had no problem keeping current on her bills. (Tr. 30). She did not discover until she
arrived at the new job (in the other state) the prospective employer had just laid off 90 employees and was not going to put her on the payroll. Seven months
passed before she could find a job which paid about half of what she had been making as ----------------- prior to her move in May 1991. (Tr. 20-22; Exhibit A).
She surmised she was laid off from the job she finally found in the other state because she was going to file a sexual harassment lawsuit. </P>

<P>Applicant contacted the creditor in subparagraph 1d by letter and by phone and said she would pay when she could. (Tr. 21). </P>

<P>Applicant has constantly thought about filing bankruptcy but has not had the money to pay for the filing requirements. (Tr. 43). In addition, she heard
bankruptcy can cause problems. (Tr. 50).  She never thought about consulting financial counselors or a consumer counseling service. (Tr. 44). Applicant has
constantly talked to her present husband about their financial difficulty and they both have tried unsuccessfully to get different positions to earn more money.
(Tr. 49-50). </P>

<P><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors
must be considered in every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U> <U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case
nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition,
the Judge, as the trier of fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><STRONG>Financial Problems (Criterion F)</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>1. a history of not meeting financial obligations.</P>

<P>3. inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>None.</P>

<P><STRONG>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</STRONG></P>

<P>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of
Enclosure 2 of the Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P>

<P>As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available
information, both favorable and unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of a security clearance under this
Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the
future. The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge
cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion F (financial problems) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability
and trustworthiness. While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard
classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past
adverse conduct is unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Applicant's history of financial problems began in December 1989 when the automobile credit company charged off the deficiency balance of $4,400 due on her
car. Other than expressing her discontent over the terms of the modified lease in 1988, Applicant has offered no evidence demonstrating any efforts to resolve
the debt.</P>

<P>Applicant's other six debts are related to her job move in May 1991. However, just because she did not get the job she moved for, and had to take a job paying
less than half of the job left, she has offered no evidence of resolving any one of the other debts. For example, she testified she paid the finance company
(subparagraphs 1c and 1f) $30 a week from approximately January 1994 to April 1994. However, she presented no evidence in support of her claim. In addition,
she testified she wrote letters and called the creditor identified in subparagraph 1d. Yet, she has offered no evidence to support her assertions. </P>

<P>Although there is no evidence of the generation of any additional debts after November 1993, the existing debts are not small nor were they created over a short
period of time. At the present time, she owes approximately $21,000 and has taken no documented steps to address the debts since she moved in May 1991.</P>

<P>Mitigating factor #3 (financial problems) applies when the evidence reveals the debts were caused by conditions beyond the debtor's control. The fact the job
offer was withdrawn just prior to Applicant's arrival in May 1991 was truly unfortunate and clearly exacerbated Applicant's financial problems. The passage of
seven months before she could find another job which paid only half the salary of her ---------------- job, coupled with the major mechanical difficulties of the
second car, definitely compounded Applicant's financial woes. In addition, it is reasonable to infer the seasonal employment of Applicant's husband has
frustrated Applicant's efforts over the years to improve her financial condition. However, Applicant has taken no steps or even formulated a plan to handle the
debts. Without any documentation indicating or even suggesting efforts to repay or otherwise resolve her debts through counseling assistance or bankruptcy, the
chances are Applicant's present financial problems will persist in the future. </P>

<P><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Formal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Factual support for the foregoing findings are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS above.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></U></P>

for Applicant.</P>
