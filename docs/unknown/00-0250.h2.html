<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 28, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 11, 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 6, 2000.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or 
information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on October 
23, 2000, and submitted a response on November 20, 2000.  This response was inadvertently filed in the case's "Correspondence 
File" and not in the case "Pleadings and Exhibits File."  As a result, I did not notice Applicant's response in making my Decision  
The case was initially received by me for resolution on November 27, 2000, and a Decision was issued on December 8, 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appealed my original Decision on the basis that I did not consider her response.  The Appeal Board has remanded that 
Decisions "with instructions to issue a new decision . . . after the Judge considers the case file (including Applicant's response to 
the FORM) that was complied before the Judge was assigned the case."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's response to which Department Counsel has no objection consists of a three page cover letter by the Applicant 
addressing the allegations of the SOR; a one page document addressing allegation 1.l. of the SOR; a one page document 
addressing allegation 1.v. of the SOR; a one page document addressing allegation 1.h. of the SOR; a two page document 
addressing allegation 1.s. of the SOR; another one page document addressing allegation 1.v. of the SOR; a one page document 
addressing allegation 1.w. of the SOR; a one page document addressing allegation 1.x. of the SOR; and  a one page document 
addressing allegation 1.x. of the SOR.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's financial difficulties, personal conduct 
and related criminal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material, and the Applicant's 
response.  The Applicant is 40 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor as a software engineer.  Her employer seeks a 
security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~aa.  The Applicant, by her own admission, was indebted to 26 separate creditors in the amount of more than $14,000.00 in 
past due indebtedness (Government Exhibits (GXs) 8 and 9, and Applicant's response (Response)).  Most recently, however, after 
the issuance of the SOR in June of 2000, the Applicant in July and August has either paid off or made arrangements to pay off 
nearly all of this past due indebtedness (GXs 3 and 4, and Response).  There is still little explanation, other than a reference to a 
number of failed marriages, as to how she incurred her past due indebtedness; but she avers that, due to a tax refund and her 
income increasing by $20,000.00 a year, she can now address it (GX 3 at page 2, <EM>see also</EM> Response at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 3.a.  In answering question 38 on her February 1999 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP) (GX 5 at page 
11), the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to disclose any of her past due indebtedness, except for her student loan of 
$472.00, listed in subparagraph 1.t. of the SOR.  This lack of candor is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b.  The Applicant was arrested in August of 1996, and subsequently charged with larceny (GX 6 and GX 8 at page 1).  The 
charge was later dismissed, as it appears it was based on a false accusation (<EM>id</EM>).  Accordingly, this subparagraph is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's response adds little in the way of mitigation, other than demonstrating that she is now addressing her past due 
indebtedness.  In fact, all of the documents appended to her three page response cover letter address debts that I had previously 
given the Applicant credit for either paying or as being paid in full.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a 
security concern, which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should 
be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of 
the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each 
security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the 
realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . 
. . or similar form . . . ;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive,"[e]ach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, 
including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the 
evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in 
nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and 
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a 
rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard 
classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which 
demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or an unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations; and Criminal Conduct also creates doubt about her judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.  
Furthermore, an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and 
regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in her private affairs, there 
then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's past due indebtedness, which was well in excess of $14,000.00.  By July of 1999, despite having 
a positive cash flow of nearly $300.00 each month (GX 8 at page 4), it was not until a year later that she finally began to address 
this past due indebtedness.  She began to pay these past due debts only after being prompted by the issuance of the SOR in June of 
2000.  This lack of responsible action is clearly of present security significance, and outweighs the fact that she has paid the 
majority of the debts.  Thus Guideline F is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was less than candid with the Government as to her financial difficulties on her February 1999 QNSP.  This wilful 
falsification is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  She would have the Government believe that her past due indebtedness was 
only $472.00, when in fact it was well in excess of $14,000.00.  She avers she "had forgotten" all of this past due indebtedness. 
(Response at page 2).  This is not believable.  Both Guidelines E and J are therefore found against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her Personal Conduct, Financial 
Difficulties, and Criminal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E, F and J, and of 
Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E, F and J.</SPAN></P>
