<P>Applicant was not candid in completing his security clearance application and failed to include criminal charges and to list his first marriage and information about his first wife.  In communications 
with employers, he misrepresented his higher education record.  He was admonished by an employer for sending an unsolicited and sexually suggestive communication to another employee, and he 
denied this conduct in interviews with authorized investigators.  His conduct as a consultant for a defense contractor violated his employer's service agreement with the defense contractor.  
Applicant's conduct raised security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the Directive.  He provided no credible explanations for his falsifications, omissions, and failure to comply with 
his employers' rules and regulations.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On February 17, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and 
Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  
Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge and filed an answer to the SOR on April 6, 2006.  On July 12, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  I convened a hearing on November 
15, 2006 to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Because the hearing could not be completed on November 15, it 
was continued.  The hearing was resumed and completed on November 17, 2006.  The Government called no witnesses, introduced 23 exhibits, and offered two documents containing facts for 
administrative notice.  The Government's exhibits were identified as Ex. 1 through 23.  The documents containing facts offered by the Government for administrative notice were designated Ex. I and 
Ex II.  Applicant  testified on his own behalf and called one additional witness.  Applicant introduced 24 exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A, B, and F through BB, and he introduced three 
documents, identified as Ex. C, D, and E, containing facts for administrative notice.  The Government's exhibits and Applicant's exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection.  The 
Government's documents containing facts for administrative notice and Applicant's documents containing facts for administrative notice were admitted without objection.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 5, 2006, DOHA received the transcript for the November 15, 2006 hearing (Tr. I).  On December 8, 2006, DOHA received the transcript of the November 17, 2007 proceeding (Tr. 
II).  By letter dated January 29, 2007, Applicant advised that the mailing address specified for him on the transcripts was not correct and he supplied a correct address. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains twelve allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the Directive.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation at &para; 1.a., that in 
ay 1984 he was charged with and found guilty of attempted larceny, a misdemeanor, and the allegation at &para; 1.h., that, in November 2000, as an employee of a government contractor, he delivered 
an anonymous, unsolicited, and sexually suggestive letter to a co-worker's mailbox.  He denied the remaining ten allegations in the SOR and noted mitigating circumstances.  Applicant's admissions 
are included herein as findings of  fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42 years old.  Since 2002, he has been employed as a senior subcontract manager by a defense contractor.  Prior to taking his current position, Applicant was employed for approximately 
18 years in procurement, subcontract management, inventory control, and shipping and receiving.  He has worked as a direct employee and as a consultant. (Ex. 1, 2, 3, 5.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's Academic Record</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After graduating from high school, Applicant enrolled in a community college.  He signed up to take four courses in the winter of 1985, but he withdrew and did not complete the courses.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
Applicant renewed his academic studies at the community college in the Spring of 1992.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1998, Applicant submitted a resume to an employer in a format that falsely stated he had been awarded an associate degree in business management in December 1993 from the 
community college and was "currently pursuing studies in Business Administration" at a State university.  Under the education section of his resume, Applicant identified his high school and listed the 
month and date of his graduation.  He then listed the name of the community college, "December 1993," and "Associates Degree in Business Management."  (Ex. 5 at 2.)  Applicant's academic 
record from the community college shows that as of December 1998 he had earned 22 credit hours toward his associate's degree.  His academic record from the community college further shows he 
earned three academic credits in the Spring of 1994 and did not earn any additional academic credits until the Spring of 1999.  (Ex. F.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2000, Applicant sent a resume and a cover letter to a prospective employer.  In his cover letter Applicant stated: "I continue to pursue a Bachelors Degree in Individualized Studies with an 
emphasis on Contracting at [State University] in which I currently maintain a near 4.0 GPA."  (Ex. 6.)  Applicant's academic record from the community college, where he was pursuing his 
associate's degree in April 2000, does not show he had taken or was taking any courses specifically identified as contracting courses.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2002, the community college awarded him a degree of Associate of Applied Science, Magna Cum Laude, with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.54.   He had earned a total 
of 72 credit hours.  (Ex. F at 6-10; Ex. 17.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's goal was to be admitted to a program at a state university that would enable him to design academic studies for himself that complemented his professional experience.  He learned he 
could transfer his community college credits to a program at the State university which provided opportunities for individualized study.  In the Spring of 2003, Applicant was admitted to a bachelor 
of individualized study (BIS) program at a four-year State university.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In order to be admitted to the BIS program at the university, an applicant had to show successful completion of at least 30 
semester hours of college credit and a 2.0 cumulative GPA.  By August 2005, Applicant had earned 21 hours of credit toward his bachelor's degree in individualized studies at the State University 
and had a  GPA of 3.29.  (Ex. 17.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement to a DSS special agent on October 5, 2005, Applicant stated: "The only place I have achieved a 4.0 grade point average was when I attended a [university satellite 
campus] . . . program that I completed in 2002.  I did claim a "near" 4.0 average while attending [State university] in a letter to my former employer."  (Ex. 18 at 1.)  At his hearing, Applicant 
continued to argue that he did not misrepresent his academic record.  (Ex. H; Ex. I ; Tr. I at 77-82.)  I did not find him credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's Arrests and Criminal Charges</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1984, when he was 19 years old, Applicant and a companion were arrested and charged with attempted larceny.  The charge was reduced to trespassing.  On the advice of counsel, Applicant pled 
guilty and paid a fine of approximately $100.  Applicant has not communicated with the companion  in over 20 years. (Answer to SOR at 1; Ex. 12; Tr. I at 73-74; Tr. II at 33.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1989, when he was about 24 years old, Applicant and his girlfriend (later his wife) stole a television set he estimated to cost about $250 from the department store where the girlfriend worked.  
They were arrested and charged with larceny.  Applicant pled guilty to attempted petty larceny.  He was fined and sentenced to 30 days work release.  At the time of his arrest, Applicant learned his 
girlfriend had been fired from a previous job for stealing from her employer.  (Answer to SOR at 1; Ex. 19 at 1; Tr. I at 74-77; Tr. II at 33-36.)  In his answer to SOR allegation 1.b., Applicant denied 
he voluntarily and knowingly stole the television set.  He has been divorced from his wife since 1998 and no longer has contact with her. The two events occurred 22 and 17 years ago.  (Answer to 
SOR at 1.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's Marriages</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1991, Applicant married the girlfriend with whom he had stolen the television set.  It was his first marriage.  Applicant's grandmother, who suffered from dementia, lived with the 
couple from approximately 1994 to 1996, and Applicant was responsible for managing the grandmother's financial affairs.  Applicant believed his wife was abusing his grandmother.  (Ex. K; Tr. I at 
95-98.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant's wife filed for divorce and alleged physical abuse.  (Ex.4 at 8-9.)  In a signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in October 2005, 
Applicant stated: 'I have never hit, kicked, or hit [his first wife] with any type of object.  However, around the very first part of the time we lived together, we had a fight.  She threw a magazine at 
me, and I threw it back.  This is the only such incident I have had with any female."  (Ex. 18 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Later, in two signed, sworn statements to DSS special agents, Applicant admitted he and his wife had physical altercations during the marriage on three occasions and that he "hit her four or five 
times with my closed fist in the stomach and back" in about 1996.  The couple separated in 1996 and was divorced in 1998.  (Ex. 19; Ex. 20; Tr. I at 95-99.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married for a second time in 1999.  He remains married to his second wife, who appeared as a witness at his hearing.  (Ex. 1; Tr. II, 16-31.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's Work for Defense Contractors</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From approximately November 1998 to May 2000, Applicant was employed by a company that supplied consultants to a defense contractor . His work as a consultant was at will, and in April 2000, 
Applicant was circulating his resume and looking for a permanent job.  Toward the end of April, he decided to terminate his employment as a consultant to the defense contractor.  He worked 
onday and Tuesday of the week of April 24 to 29.<STRONG> </STRONG> He did not work April 26, 27, 28, or 29.  (Tr. II at 39-40; Ex. 7.).)  On Sunday, April 30, he went to his office at the defense contractor and 
downloaded and printed personal records and information belonging to the defense contractor.  From the defense contractor's fax machine, he faxed his weekly time report to the consulting firm 
which employed him and paid his salary.  The weekly time report, which he signed, showed he worked eight hours on each of the six days from April 24 to April 29.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant cleaned out his desk 
and left the offices of the defense contractor.  In a signed sworn statement dated November 30, 2005, Applicant claimed he did not intentionally submit a false time report.  He also said he did not 
work any hours for his employer between April 24 and April 29.  (Ex. 19 at 2.)  In testimony, he claimed he worked two days, April 24 and 25.  (Tr. I, 106-108.)  I did not find him credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On Monday, May 1, 2000, Applicant called the procurement manager at the defense contractor and told him he had accepted a permanent position at another company and would no longer be 
working for him.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The procurement manager advised Applicant to call the consulting company that employed him and  inform that company he was quitting.  He also advised Applicant to return  his 
badge, desk keys, and any confidential or proprietary data in his possession to the defense contractor.  (Tr. II at 14-15; Ex. 8.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By letter dated May 4, 2000, the contracts administrator at the defense contractor informed Applicant's consultancy employer that the defense contractor's records showed Applicant had printed 90 
documents on Sunday morning, and that 52 of those documents could not be found and were presumed to be in Applicant's possession.  The defense contractor claimed that many of those 
documents were corporate documents and were considered to be confidential.  The defense contractor said it considered Applicant's actions to be serious and had reason to believe Applicant had 
gone to work for a competitor.  It requested that the consultancy return Applicant's admissions badge, his desk keys, other contracting documents in Applicant's possession, all documents printed by 
Applicant, and all copies he made of the printed documents.  (Ex. 8.)  In a follow-up letter to the president of the consulting firm, dated May 11, 2000, the contracts administrator for the defense 
contractor referred to the responsibility of the consulting firm to ensure that all individuals it hired and sent to the defense contractor complied with the confidential information provisions of the 
service agreement between the defense contractor and the consultancy employer.  The contracts administrator concluded that Applicant's conduct in using the defense contractor's information system 
networks to print personal documents and company documents for other than company business purposes on Sunday, April 30 violated the service agreement. He again requested that Applicant 
return all documents he printed on the defense contractor's information systems networks and, in addition, that Applicant execute and provide to the defense contractor a signed affidavit "which 
states that [Applicant] did not take any other [company] documentation and he does not have any [company] documentation is his possession and/or he has not transferred from his possession any 
[company] documentation obtained during his assignment on the [consulting] contract at [company]."  (Ex. 9 at 1-2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 24, 2000, Applicant executed and signed the following affidavit:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I, [Applicant], have returned all documents that were mistakenly taken with my personal belongings from [defense contractor company's] facilities.  I no longer have any [company] documentation in 
my possession and I have not, at any time, transferred from my possession any [company] documentation obtained during my assignment at [company.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Ex. 10 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the signed, sworn statement he gave to a DSS special agent on November 30, 2005, Applicant stated that a year later, in about April 2001, when moving from one residence to another, he found a 
purchasing manual belonging to the defense contractor in his home. He said he reviewed the manual and concluded it did not contain confidential or proprietary information.  At the time of his 
interview with the DSS agent, Applicant  had the manual in his possession. He said he would give it to the DSS agent.  (Ex. 19 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement dated December 1, 2005, Applicant admitted he had failed to give the purchasing manual to the DSS special agent, as he had indicated on November 30, 2005, he would 
do.  He said he could not find it and thought his wife had mailed it back to the defense contractor at the beginning of November 2005.  He said he last saw the manual in his home at the beginning of  
November 2005.  He said he had not opened the manual or reviewed it.  Applicant also admitted he possessed "about 20 pages" of material on cost accounting standards belonging to the defense 
contractor.  (Ex. 20 at 1.)  He mailed 27 pages of the defense contractor's cost accounting standards documents to a DSS agent in December 2005. (Ex. 21.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed sworn statement to a DSS agent on October 4, 2005, Applicant claimed he left his consultancy position at the defense contractor on Sunday, April 30, 2000, because he had "received an 
employment offer that required me to start immediately." (Ex. 18 at 1.)  In a signed, sworn statement to a DSS special agent, dated November 30, 2005, Applicant acknowledged his supervisor at the 
consulting company was upset he had left the defense contractor without giving notice.  He said he reported to work at his new employer on May 1, 2000, the day after printing the documents on the 
defense contractor's information system network  At his hearing, Applicant testified he did not have a new job to report to when he tendered his resignation on May 1, 2000, and he had not reported 
to a new position on that day.  Instead, he had traveled across the country to join his wife for a vacation.  The SF-86 he executed and signed February 18, 2004, indicated Applicant did not work for 
another employer until June 1, 2000.  (Ex. 19; Tr. II, 56-58; Ex. 3.)</SPAN>  Applicant consistently made false and misleading statements.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's next job with a defense contractor commenced in June 2000 and ended in August 2002 (Employer X).  (Ex. 3.)  Applicant stated there was a culture of harassment in Employer X's 
workplace.  Applicant concluded one co-worker, a female, was responsible for harassing other employees.  In November 2000, he wrote an anonymous unsolicited and sexually suggestive letter to 
the co-worker and put it in her office mailbox.  The letter invited a response from the woman and instructed her to put her response in an envelope, mark it with a red check mark, and leave it in her 
mailbox.  The woman sought the advice of her facility security officer (FSO), who advised her to comply with the instructions in the letter.  The employee did so.  The FSO then set up a surveillance 
camera very early in the morning in front of the employee's mailbox.  The surveillance camera recorded Applicant coming to the employee's mailbox and picking up the marked letter.  The FSO 
reported the incident to the company's management.  A senior management official met with Applicant, told him he knew Applicant had been the perpetrator of the note, and told him not to do it 
again.  (Ex. B at 4-5; Tr. I, 115-118; Tr. II, 50-52.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent on July 16, 2003 and shown a copy of the sexually suggestive note left in the mailbox of his female coworker in November 2000.  He initially 
denied any involvement in the passing of this or other notes to the co-worker, although he later recalled being questioned by a company manager regarding the matter.  He said he did not volunteer 
this information in his initial interview when a DSS agent asked him if he had ever been called before a supervisor or manager regarding unprofessional conduct because he misunderstood what was 
being asked.  In a signed, sworn statement to a DSS special agent on July 16, 2003, Applicant denied any involvement in the incident and stated he was willing to undergo a polygraph exam regarding 
the matter.  (Ex. B, 13-14; Ex. 16 at 1-2.)  I find Applicant intentionally misled and lied to investigators.</P> 
 
<P>On November 30, 2005, in an interview with a DSS special agent, Applicant admitted writing and sending the anonymous sexually suggestive letter to his coworker in November 2000.  He 
characterized the conduct as a prank.  ( Ex. 19 at 3.)  </P> 
 
<P>By letter dated July 7, 2002, Applicant resigned from his position with Employer X.  He complained his immediate manager had intentionally subjected him to emotional distress and that higher 
management had condoned the immediate manager's harassing conduct.  (Ex. 14 at 1.)</P>

<P>The instructions for completing the SF-86 form include the following advisory:</P> 
 
<P>3. All questions on this form must be answered.  If no response is necessary or applicable, indicate this on the form (for example, enter "None" or "N/A").  If you find that you cannot report an exact 
date, approximate or estimate the date to the best of your ability and indicate this by marking "APPROX" or "EST."  (Government Document for Administrative Notice I at 1.)</P> 
 
<P>Item 13 on the instructions directs an applicant to "mark one box to show your current marital status and provide information about your spouse(s) in items a. and/or b."  Item 13(a) requires an 
applicant to list specific information about a current spouse.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Item 13 (b) requires an applicant to provide the full names of all former spouses, including their birth dates, places of birth, countries of 
citizenship, dates of marriage, and places where married.  Additionally, an applicant is required to report whether the marriage ended by death or divorce and the date that occurred.  An applicant is 
also required to list the jurisdiction where the record of divorce is maintained and to provide the address and telephone number of the former spouse.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> (Government Document for Administrative 
Notice at 5.)  </P> 
 
<P>Item 23 (a) on the instructions for completing a SF-86 asks an applicant to respond either "yes" or "no" to this question: "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?"  
(Government Document for Administrative Notice I at 7.)<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>While he was employed by Employer X, Applicant completed a security clearance application and signed it electronically on August 31, 2001.  In response to the question requiring him to identify  
spouses and former spouses, Applicant listed and provided information about his current spouse.  He failed to list his former spouse and supply requested information about her.  In response to the 
question asking him if he had ever been charged or convicted of a felony, Applicant answered "no."  (Ex. 1.)  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant resigned his position with Employer X in July 2002, claiming he had been treated unfairly and harassed.  He took a job with another defense contractor and completed another SF-86 on 
July 16, 2003.  In response to the question requiring him to identify and provide information on spouses or former spouses, he again listed and provided information only about his current spouse.  In 
response to the question asking him if he had ever been charged or convicted of a felony, Applicant again answered "no."  (Ex. 2.)</P> 
 
<P>On the SF-86 he completed on July 16, 2003, Applicant provided information that had not appeared on his August 2001 SF-86 because it had not occurred until July 2002.  In response to Question 
20, which asks if an individual has ever been fired from a job, quit a job after being told he would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, left a job by mutual 
agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or left a job for another reason under unfavorable circumstances, Applicant answered "yes"and stated he had left a job for other 
reasons under unfavorable circumstances. Under the "remarks" portion of his response, he stated: "I was being harassed/bullied by a manager at [Employer X].  I filed several complaints, I was not 
satisfied with how [Employer X] responded to the situation, the harassment continued and I decided to separate from the company."  (Ex. 2.)</P> 
 
<P>The following certification appears at the end of the SF-86 form:</P> 
 
<P>My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful 
false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of  title 18, United States Code.)</P> 
 
<P>On February 18, 2004, Applicant signed and certified the SF-86 he executed on July 16, 2003.  (Ex. 3.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant claimed his failure to list his first wife on his SF-86 was an oversight.  He testified he filled out only one SF-86 and signed it electronically in August 2001. He said his current employer 
forwarded his SF-86 to the government without providing him with an opportunity to review his answers.  The facility security officer at his present employer provided a letter on Applicant's behalf 
that stated, in pertinent part: "The security form that this facility processed on [Applicant's] behalf was a SF-86 from his previous employer."  Applicant also testified that his failure to list his first 
wife on his SF-86 was brought to his attention in a security interview on July 16, 2003.  (Tr. II, 52-53; Ex. A.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant testified he did not list his felony charge in 1989 because he thought he had been charged with shoplifting, which was a misdemeanor.  He said he only recently learned the crime was  
considered a larceny because the value of the television he stole was estimated to be $250, and the State where the crime was committed defines larceny as a theft of an item with a value of $200 or 
more.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Applicant also testified he pled guilty to a lesser offense and then attempted to retract his plea.  He said the prosecutor in the case advised him that if he retracted his plea to the lesser 
offense, the State would then try him on the felony count, which carried a sentence of one year in jail.  (Tr. I, 74-76.)</P>

The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,

necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA's allegations in the SOR raised security concerns under Guideline E about Applicant's truthfulness, judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Guideline E 
conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not 
properly safeguard classified information. <EM> See</EM> Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions (DC) apply to the conduct alleged in the SOR. Applicant's coworkers, business associates, and employers supplied reliable unfavorable information 
about his personal conduct, which was alleged in &para;&para; 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1. h., thus raising  security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.1.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The allegations in &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d. that Applicant

deliberately falsified material facts on security clearance applications he executed on August 31, 2001, July 16, 2003, and February 18, 2004 by failing to list his former wife, to whom he was married 
for seven years, and by answering "no" to Question 21 and subsequently failing to list a felony charge in 1989 also raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  The allegations in &para;&para; 1.i.(1) and 
1.i.(2) that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in an interview with a DSS special agent and in a signed sworn statement made to the DSS agent raise security concerns under DC 
E2.A5.1.2.3.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations in &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.h., 1.j., and 1.k. raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.4.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> because Applicant's conduct and his deliberate omissions and  alsifications regarding that conduct  
increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. The allegations at &para;&para; 1.f. and 1.g. that Applicant violated a service agreement between his consulting company employer and a defense 
contractor also raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The allegations at &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.b. raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.6.<A HREF="03-19701.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are seven Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might be applicable to disqualifying conditions raised under Guideline E.  First, a Guideline E security concern that arises from reliable unfavorable 
information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, or other acquaintances might be mitigated if the information they provide was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a 
determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. MC E2.A5.1.3.1.  Second, a falsification on a SF-86 or in an interview with an authorized investigator, or on a sworn statement signed in the 
presence of an authorized investigator might be mitigated if it was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided the correct information voluntarily.  MC 
E2.A5.1.3.2.  Third, a falsification might be mitigated if the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  MC E2.A5.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Fourth, an omission of material facts might be mitigated if the omission was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously 
omitted information was promptly and fully provided. MC E2.A5.1.3.4.  Fifth, a falsification or omission might be mitigated if the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  MC E2.A5.1.3.5.  Sixth, a refusal to cooperate with an investigation might be mitigated if the refusal was based on advice from legal 
counsel or other officials that the individual was not required to comply with security processing requirements and, upon being made aware of the requirement, the individual  fully and truthfully 
provided the requested information. MC E2.A5.1.3.6.  Finally, an individual can mitigate certain personal conduct if he or she provides evidence that association with persons involved in criminal 
activities has ceased.  MC E2.A5.1.3.7. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to the allegation at &para; 1.a. of the SOR, Applicant admitted he and an companion were arrested in 1984 and charged with petty larceny.  In his answer to the SOR, he denied he had 
voluntarily and knowingly stolen a television set with his girlfriend in 1989, as alleged at SOR 1.b., and he denied he had subsequently been charged with larceny.  Applicant's conduct and his denial 
of the larceny charge raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.4., E2.A5.1.2.5., and E2.A5.1.2.6.  Applicant's past conduct and his denial of responsibility for the conduct could increase his 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  The conduct reveals a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation, and it demonstrates association with persons involved in criminal activity.  Applicant 
presented no credible evidence to rebut the Government's allegations of criminal charges.  While Applicant is no longer associated with the persons with whom he carried out criminal activity, he 
failed to show he had taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  Accordingly, while MC  E2.A5.1.3.7. applies to the allegations at &para;&para; 
1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR, MC E2.A5.1.3.5. does not. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two of Applicant's former employers provided business records that had been prepared by Applicant.  In those documents, Applicant misrepresented his educational background on two separate 
occasions, once on a resume and once in an letter to a employer who later hired him.  Applicant's academic record for the year 2000 shows he was not enrolled at the State university, did not have a 
cumulative 4.0 GPA, and had not and was not taking specialized courses in contracting.  Applicant provided no credible evidence to rebut the Government's allegations that he deliberately 
misrepresented his academic background.  The information provided by the former employers was substantiated and pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I find he 
deliberately falsified his academic record.  Thus, MC E2.A5.1.3.1. is inapplicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The conduct alleged at &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d. also raises security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  To bolster his employment qualifications, Applicant falsified his academic record and educational 
background in documents offered to employers.  His falsifications were not isolated incidents, and he continued at his hearing to deny them.  He did not make prompt good-faith efforts to correct the 
falsifications, and he did not provide correct information voluntarily.  Accordingly, MC E2.A5.1.3.2. and E2.A5.1.3.3. are inapplicable.  No other Guideline E mitigating conditions apply to the 
disqualifying conduct alleged at &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is substantive evidence that Applicant submitted a fraudulent time card when he resigned from his position as a consultant in April 2000 (SOR &para; 1.e.); violated a service agreement between his 
employer and a defense contractor when, prior to tendering his resignation, he went to the defense contractor's offices after normal working hours and printed out documents belonging to the 
contractor and took them home for personal use and retention (SOR &para; 1.f.); executed a false affidavit on May 24, 2000, asserting he had returned all documents in his possession belonging to the 
defense contractor when in fact he retained certain documents until they were surrendered by him to DSS investigators in December 2005 (SOR &para; 1.g.); and, in November 2000, delivered an 
anonymous, unsolicited, and sexually suggestive letter to a co-worker's mailbox (SOR &para; 1.h.).  There is reliable, unfavorable information that raised security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.1. 
Applicant presented no credible information to rebut the Government's allegations. The information submitted by Applicant's former employers was substantiated and pertinent to a determination of 
his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  Accordingly, MC E2.A5.1.3.1. is inapplicable.  No other Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The conduct alleged at &para;&para; 1.f. and 1.g. also raises security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5., for it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  The conduct alleged at &para; 1.h. raises an additional 
security concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.4. because it suggests behavior that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Applicant presented  no credible evidence to 
rebut or mitigate these security concerns. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 16, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the DSS.  During that interview, Applicant deliberately falsified material facts, when, after being shown the anonymous, unsolicited, 
and sexually suggestive letter, he denied any knowledge or involvement in the matter. (SOR &para; 1.i(1)).  During that interview, Applicant executed and signed a sworn statement denying any 
involvement in the writing or delivery of the sexually suggestive letter to his co-worker.  (&para; 1.i.(2)).  Applicant knew his oral and written statements regarding the matter were false.  During an 
interview with a special agent of the DSS on November 30, 2005, he admitted writing the letter and delivering it to his co-worker.  Applicant also admitted writing the letter and delivering it to his 
co-worker in his answer to the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct raises security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.3., for he deliberately provided false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in 
connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  DC E2.A5.1.2.5. also applies because Applicant's conduct revealed a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  Neither MC 
E2.A5.1.3.2, MC E2.A5.1.3.3., or E2.A5.1.3.5. applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 31, 2001, Applicant executed a SF-86 and signed it electronically.  On July 16, 2003, he revised the SF-86 he had completed in 2001 and added an explanation of the conditions that led 
him to quit a previous job in July 2002.  On February 18, 2004, he signed the SF-86 he had revised on July 16, 2003.  The instructions for completing a SF-86 make clear an applicant must answer all 
questions and supply all information requested.  On each of the three iterations of his SF-86, he failed to list his first marriage and to supply pertinent information about his first wife. (SOR &para;1.j.)  
Applicant's failure to list his first marriage and to identify his first wife on his SF-86 was a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts and raises security concerns 
under DC E2.A5.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed his failure to list his first marriage and to identify his first spouse was an oversight.  From the record, it is fair to assume he had three opportunities to review the SF-86 and comply 
with instructions.  The record also recites that Applicant and his first wife were partners in crime and had violent physical altercations during their seven-year marriage.  It was not a relationship that 
one would easily forget.  I conclude that Applicant's testimony  that he forgot to report his first marriage and identify his first spouse was not credible.  I also conclude that his omission was 
deliberate.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's falsification was not an isolated incident and it was recent.  He did not provide the correct information voluntarily, and he did not make prompt good-faith efforts to correct the 
falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Accordingly, neither MC E2.A5.1.3.2. nor E2.A5.1.3.3. applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the SF-86s he executed on August 31, 2001, July 16, 2003, and February 18, 2004, Applicant was required to report all charged felony offenses.  Applicant answered "no" to Question 21 on all 
three versions of his SF-86, even though he had been charged with a felony in his State of residence for stealing a television set valued at over $200 in 1989.  (SOR &para; 1.k.).  Applicant's failure to list 
his felony charge in response to Question 21 on the SF-86 was a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts and raises security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed he did not know he had been charged with a felony when he was arrested for stealing the television set.  He stated he had pled guilty to a lesser offense and then attempted to 
withdraw his plea.  He also testified the prosecutor stated that if he withdrew his plea of guilty to the lesser offense, he would be charged and tried for the felony originally charged.  Applicant's denial 
that he was charged with a felony lacks credibility.  I conclude he deliberately falsified his answer to Question 21 on his SF-86.  No Guideline E mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.2 of the Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance case not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful weighing 
of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct (E2.2.1.1); the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation (E2.2.1.2); the frequency and recency of the conduct (E2.2.1.3); the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct (E2.2.1.4.); the voluntariness of participation (E2.2.1.5.); the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (E2.2.1.6); the motivation for the conduct 
(E2.2.1.7); the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.2.1.8.); and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence (E2.2.1.9)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42 years old.  He is a mature man and has had the benefit of higher education.  The record reflects he has a clear knowledge of the English language and knew what he was certifying with 
his signature on the SF-86s he executed and on the statements he signed and certified in the presence of authorized investigators.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant prepared a resume and a letter seeking employment that misrepresented his educational  background.  In the workplace, he filed a time card that falsely claimed payment for time he did not 
work, and he violated his employer's service agreement with a defense contractor by downloading and copying the defense contractor's documents and taking them to his home for his own use after 
he resigned from the defense contractor's employment.  He executed an affidavit stating he had returned all of the defense contractor's documents, but he retained some of the defense contractor's 
documents for several years.  He sent an unsolicited sexually suggestive note to a co-worker, then denied he sent it, and finally admitted his action.  Applicant's personal conduct in the workplace 
involved questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.   His testimony about his conduct was misleading and deceptive and lacked 
credibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed and considered all of the evidence, and I have assessed Applicant's credibility and demeanor.  After weighing the applicable Guideline E disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and 
after considering all relevant factors in the whole person analysis, I conclude all SOR Guideline E allegations against Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past 
transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  
Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude 
Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of 
Defense Directive, 5220.6, as amended. </SPAN></P>
