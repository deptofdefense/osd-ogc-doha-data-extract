<P>Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross issued a decision, dated October 27, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 2, 1998 to Applicant.  The
SOR was based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement).  A hearing was held on August 13, 1998.  The Administrative Judge
subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is now before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse
decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's factual findings about his history of drug abuse.  However,
Applicant argues: (a) he has never mishandled classified information since he began working for his employer, a defense
contractor, in 1979; (b) his work has always been of the highest quality, and his skills and abilities are an asset to his
employer; and (c) he is currently in counseling, he has remained drug-free, and he will never return to drug abuse.  The
Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.</P>

<P>Attached to Applicant's appeal brief is a document that is not part of the record evidence.  That document constitutes new
evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 29.  In addition, that
document pertains to a matter that occurred after the hearing.  The Board reviews a Judge's decision based on the record
evidence before the Judge, and it will not find the Judge erred based on consideration of matters or events that occur after
the close of the record.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0769 (July 9, 1998) at p. 3 ("A Judge cannot fairly be found to have
erred for not considering events that might occur after the close of the record evidence.").</P>

<P>The absence of any security violation by Applicant does not render the Administrative Judge's adverse decision arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to
properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke that person's access to classified information. 
<EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Security clearance decisions
are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's
past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Direct or objective
evidence of nexus is not required before the government can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>Gayer v.
Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  All that is necessary is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate
that an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high
degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3.  A history of drug abuse raises questions about an applicant's suitability for
access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g., AFGE Local 1533 v. Cheney</EM>, 944 F.2d 503, 506 n.6 (9th Cir. 1991)(noting
various ways that drug abuse could pose security risks).  Applicant's history of drug abuse provides a rational basis for the
Judge's negative conclusions about Applicant's suitability for a security clearance.</P>

<P>The value of Applicant's skills and abilities to his employer is irrelevant to a determination of his suitability for a security
clearance.  There is no logical connection between Applicant's  suitability for access to classified information and his
value to his employer.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0710 (June 20, 1997) at p. 3.  It is possible for an applicant to be an
asset to his or her employer, yet at the same time fail to demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness that must be expected of persons granted a security clearance.</P>

<P>Neither Applicant's job performance nor his efforts at drug reform are favorable evidence that required the Administrative
Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  A Judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether
the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0699 (November
24, 1998) at p. 3.  The Judge acted in a reasonable manner when he considered the evidence of Applicant's efforts at drug
rehabilitation and weighed it against Applicant's history of drug abuse.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate
weighing of the record evidence does not, standing alone, demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or
capricious manner.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Judge's October
27, 1998 decision.</P>
