<P>This 70-year-old staff engineer for a major defense contractor was born in Iran in 1935.  He first came to the United States in the 1950s, returned to the U.S. in 
the 1 960s to attend college and obtain a MA degree in 1968.  After returning to Iran in 1969, he came back one last tine in 1980, obtained a Green card, and 
eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1994.  He retains both his Iranian citizenship and passport, despite knowing the latter precludes him from holding a DoD 
security clearance.  His ties to Iran are minimal, considering his long and close ties to the U.S., and do not raise any significant security risks.  However, his 
retention of the Iranian passport has not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On May 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to  Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2,</P> 
<P>1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>On June 27, 2005, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and</P> 
<P>elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The matter was</P> 
<P>assigned to me on August 17, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 16, 2005, setting</P> 
<P>the hearing for October 13, 2005.  At the hearing, the Government offered seven documents (Government's Exhibits (GX) 1-7).  Applicant testified and offered 
one document (Applicant's  Exhibit (AX) A).  The transcript was received at DOHA on October 27, 2005.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>              Applicant is a 70-year-old engineer, born in Iran in 1935.  He came to the United States in</P> 
<P>1955, to attend college.  He obtained a Green Card and worked here during the 1960s, obtaining a</P> 
<P>DoD security clearance along the way (Tr at 29).  He became a citizen in 1994 and obtained a U.S.</P> 
<P>passport that same year.  The SOR contains three allegations, l.a.-1.c., under Guideline C (Foreign</P> 
<P>Preference) and five allegations under, 2.a.-2.e., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR Applicant admits, with explanations, all 
allegations under both Guidelines.  The</P> 
<P>factual admissions are accepted and incorporated as Findings of Fact.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence of record, I make the following Findings of</P> 
<P>Fact as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>l.a. - Applicant holds a valid Iranian passport, and considers himself to be a dual citizen of</P> 
<P>Iran and the United States.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>1 .b. - In 2000, Applicant applied for and received an Iranian passport (issued on May 3,2000</P> 
<P>and expiring on May 4, 2010).  Applicant has family ties to Iran and, under Iranian law, which does not recognize dual citizenship, he believes he is required to 
have an Iranian passport to enter that country to visit his family in the future.  He has not used the Iranian passport to enter that country. Since becoming a U.S. 
citizen in 1994, he has used only his U.S. passport for all foreign travel (GX 2, GX 3).  However, he intends to retain his Iranian passport, knowing the adverse 
consequences imposed by DoD Policy (GX 7, the Money Memorandum).</P> 
<P>1 .c. - As of June 17, 2004, when he was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), Applicant still retained that valid Iranian passport, but 
was unable to locate it.  As of the hearing on October 13, 2005, Applicant had recently renewed the Iranian passport in order to  be able to visit Iran, if he 
wished to do so in the future (Tr at 21).  As cited above, Applicant intends</P> 
<P>to retain his Iranian passport.</P> 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2 .a. - Applicant has siblings living in Canada, Germany and England, and others still residing in Iran (GX 2).  The later siblings are in their 60s, not associated 
with the Iranian government, and do not know what Applicant does for a living (Tr at 26).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.b. - Applicant's nieces are citizens and residents of Iran.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.c. - Applicant's brother is a retired family law judge in the Iranian Judicial System.  This</P> 
<P>brother is retired, and now resides in the United Kingdom (GX 2).  Applicant speaks with him by  telephone about once a month.  The brother has visited 
Applicant in the U.S. one time.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2 .d. - Applicant maintains contact with his former colleagues at a technical university in Iran.</P> 
<P>His contact with these colleagues (from the 1969-1980 period) is mostly by holiday greeting card.</P> 
<P>Some now reside in Europe.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.e. - Applicant owns property in Iran.  He purchased it along with some of his Iranian  university friends many years ago, has no documentation on the 
property, and "no way of collecting</P> 
<P>on the property" (GX 2).  He believes his interest is worth perhaps $5,000.00 (Tr at 24).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Applicant was born in 1935.  He came to the U.S. in the early 1960s. He was issued a  security clearance by DoD in 1962 (GX 1 and Tr at 23), long before he 
became a U.S. citizen.  He studied at a major U.S. university from 1962-1969, at which time he obtained a MA in Physics.  He returned to Iran and taught at an 
Iranian university from 1969 to 1980, after the overthrow of the Shah, at which time he returned to the U.S.  He has resided here ever since and became a U.S. 
citizen  in 1994.  He is divorced and has an American born daughter, now married and living in Italy.</P> 
<P>He decided to stay here and become a U.S. citizen because he appreciated the life he was able</P> 
<P>to achieve here (Tr at 33).  He would not return to Iran to live even if the present government changed (Tr at 34).  He is 70 years old, and he is where he wants 
to be (Tr at 34).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>During cross-examination, Department Counsel asked Applicant about his current Iranian</P> 
<P>passport. Possession of the Iranian passport meant that he could enter and exit that country without</P> 
<P>the risk of harassment and/or delay by Iranian authorities that might occur if he used his U.S.  passport (Tr at 39, 40).  He stated that he could probably retain 
his employment in a non-classified</P> 
<P>position within the company (Tr at 40).  Applicant understood that possession of the passport meant</P> 
<P>that he was disqualified from holding a DoD security clearance (Tr at 39 and GX 7).  Applicant  considered his alternatives and decided to retain the Iranian 
passport (Tr at 39-44).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>              Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2. 1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the  Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are  denied or otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving</P> 
<P>those controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden  (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) 
and proves conduct that creates security</P> 
<P>concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the  interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Applicant came to the U.S. more than 40 year ago, when in his mid 20s, to obtain a higher</P> 
<P>education. Iran was viewed differently then, an ally under the Shah.  It was still true when he  returned to Iran to see his ill mother and he stayed to teach at a 
university from 1969 to 1980, at which time he left for good.  He stayed for a year or two in London, and then returned permanently</P> 
<P>to the U.S. in 1982.  His parents are both deceased and he has not returned to Iran for at least two decades.  While it is true that he has some relatives remaining 
in Iran, many have left for western  countries and his contacts with those who have remained must be considered minimal in the context</P> 
<P>of his long and deep ties to the United States.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Iran and possesses a valid Iranian passport, which</P> 
<P>he intends to retain.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC). DC 1 -the exercise of dual citizenship - is applicable; as is</P> 
<P>DC 2 - possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 is  applicable, since his Iranian citizenship is derived from his parents, but he 
has exercised that citizenship by obtaining and renewing his Iranian passport.  MC 4 is not applicable since Applicant has expressed an intent to retain his dual 
citizenship, so he can retain his Iranian passport.</P> 
<P>            Guideline C (Foreign Influence)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Iran is considered by the U.S. Government to be "hostile" to the United States (GX 5 and GX</P> 
<P>6). The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: "an applicant with immediate family members living in a country hostile to the United States should not be granted 
a security clearance without a very strong showing that those family ties do not pose a security risk" (Appeal Board Decision, DISCR  Case No. 0 1-26893 
(October 16, 2002)):  Other Appeal Board guidance states that: "family ties in</P> 
<P>[any] foreign country raise a prima facie security concern" that requires an applicant "to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
meet the burden of persuasion that it is</P> 
<P>clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him" (Appeal</P> 
<P>Board Decision, ISCR Case No. 02-06478 (May 19. 2003)).</P> 
<P>Considering the totality of the evidence, the family ties cited in the SOR establish a risk in</P> 
<P>the abstract, in that the absence of problems in the past does not mean there will not be any in the  future, but such absence must be taken into account with all 
other relevant evidence.  There is no  evidence suggesting that Applicant's family members are agents of a foreign government.  While they might be pressured 
to ask Applicant to act improperly, it is not likely that Applicant would feel himself forced to decide where his loyalties lie.</P> 
<P>Guideline C - "The Concern: A security risk may exist when [members of]an individual's</P> 
<P>immediate family.. . are (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress. These</P> 
<P>situations may create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of  classified information. Contacts with citizens of foreign 
countries are also relevant to security  determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or  pressure."</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Condition - (1) " an immediate family member.. . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Mitigating Condition (MC) 1, "the 
immediate family members.., are not agents of a foreign power or are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between his loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S." is applicable.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>All of the evidence shows Applicant to be a man of integrity, and one who understands his</P> 
<P>responsibilities to his country.  At the same time, he has made an informed decision to retain his  Iranian passport, knowing that meant he would be denied a 
security clearance.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant does not posess the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking 
access to the nation's secrets.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are</P> 
<P>hereby rendered as follows:</P>
