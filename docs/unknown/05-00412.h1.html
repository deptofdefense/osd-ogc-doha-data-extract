<P>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He has resolved the majority of his debts, but at this time he still has a remaining overdue debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN> $200,000. While he has proposed an offer and compromise to settle this debt, it has yet to be accepted by the IRS.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> provided to the Government on a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance 
Application (SCA)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, materially incorrect information regarding liens against him, but he did not knowingly provide this misinformation.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 5</SPAN>, 2005 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>January 4, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations (RSOR), and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge on </SPAN>February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 8, 2006, but it was then reassigned to this Administrative Judge on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">June 29</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to the 
parties on June 29, 2006, and the hearing was held on July 19, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 20 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-20) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered 20 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 
A through T) and offered his own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on July 27, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains nine allegations, 1.a. through 1.h., under Guideline F, and one allegation, 2.a., under</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b. through 1.i., with some explanations, and he 
denied allegations 1.a. and 2.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 60 years old. He is currently unmarried, but he has been married and divorced three times in the past. He has three biological sons and one adopted son. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is employed as an 
Test Pilot by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> lists 10 examples of financial irresponsibility of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 1.a. through 1.i., under Adjudicative Guideline F.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">They will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. This debt to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $87. At the hearing, Applicant contended that this debt was paid. Exhibit A is a letter from the collection agency for this debt, 
indicating this debt has been paid in full.  I find that the current balance on this debt is $0</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. This debt to the IRS </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is in the amount of $92,733 on a tax lien for unpaid federal taxes, interest and penalties. At the hearing, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that he had engaged the services of a tax law 
firm to resolve his tax problems, in November 30, 2004, (Exhibit J), but they had mishandled this case.  He then hired another attorney, and he proposed a settlement to the IRS (Exhibit L). They are 
awaiting a response. Currently the IRS is deducting $330.37 a week to resolve his debts to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> offer of compromise to the IRS argues that after </SPAN>February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 9, 2007, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> will only owe $25,000 or less, because the remainder of his debt will no longer be collectible under the 
statute of limitations. He therefore, believes that he will be able to resolve all of his past due taxes to the IRS by </SPAN>February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 9, 2007. He introduced a copy of a check in the amount of $24,925 made 
out to him, that he plans to use to resolve his debt if the IRS accepts his offer in compromise (Exhibit F). At this time, until the IRS responds, I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> still owes the full amount alleged 
under 1.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. This debt to the IRS </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is in the amount of $22,445 on a tax lien for unpaid federal taxes, interest and penalties. This debt is also part of the proposed settlement offer to the IRS. Until the IRS 
responds, I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> still owes the full amount alleged under 1.c.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. This debt to the IRS </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is in the amount of $80,209 on a tax lien for unpaid federal taxes, interest and penalties. This debt is also part of the proposed settlement offer to the IRS. Until the IRS 
responds, I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> still owes the full amount alleged under 1.d.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. This debt for a state tax lien to State of California </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $22,744. In his Response to the SOR, and at the hearing, Applicant contended that all of his debts to the 
state had been paid in full in 2003. He testified that he received a refund from the state tax board in 2004, which he would not have received it, if he still owed a debt to the state. Exhibit 4 shows 
that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> state tax liens have been released. I find that the current balance on this debt is $0.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. This debt for a state tax lien to State of California </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $7,362. Applicant also contended that this debt had been paid. Exhibit 4 shows that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> state tax 
liens have been released. I find that the current balance on this debt is $0.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. This debt for a state tax lien to State of California </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $2,054. Applicant contended that this debt had been paid. Exhibit 4 shows that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> state tax liens 
have been released. I find that the current balance on this debt is $0.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. This debt for a state tax lien to State of California </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is listed in the SOR in the amount of $12,778. Finally, Applicant contended that this debt had been paid. Exhibit 4 shows that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> state 
tax liens have been released. I find that the current balance on this debt is $0.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l. The </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> alleges that Applicant's wages were garnished in 1985 for unpaid taxes for tax year 1980. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that this debt had been paid</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. A letter form the California Franchise 
tax board, dated July 10, 1985, indicated that the lien ended on June 11, 1985, after this debt of $122.60 was paid </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 15)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> initially became delinquent to the IRS and California Franchise tax board, because he failed to file federal and state tax returns for tax years 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. While he said 
those were difficult times in his life, he could give no specific explanation as to why he failed to file tax returns for those tax years. He attempted to make an offer in compromise with the IRS but 
was told because of the large size of the debt, he was "uncollectible." Therefore his debt to the IRS was never resolved. As discussed above, his state tax was finally paid off by liens. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also 
did not file timely tax returns for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003. He testified that he fell behind in 2001, because he was deployed overseas, and then he did not catch up until 2004 because of 
procrastination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the exception of the debt to the IRS of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately $200,000, Applicant is now current on all of his other debts. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He currently has $81,533 in his vested company account. He introduced his 
company performance evaluations for years 2002, 2004, and 2005. All of them rate </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> as exceeding expectations (Exhibit H).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> introduced letters from three Lieutenant Colonels of the </SPAN>United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Air Force. All of them have known him for many years, and they all strongly recommend him for a position 
of trust, because of his strong character and integrity and his excellent work ethic (Exhibits N, O and P). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges that when Applicant completed a signed, sworn <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">June</SPAN> 10 , 2002, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 1), </SPAN>he did not furnish truthful, complete answers.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. Question #36 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you have you had a lien place against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?" Applicant responded "Yes" and he listed the date of 
</SPAN>January<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1, 1998, for a lien to the IRS in the amount of $74,000.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time Applicant  completed the SCA, liens had been  placed against his him for all of the debts listed as 1.b. through 1.h., above. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied that he was aware that he was submitting incorrect information to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government. He testified that he had only received notice five days before he was to be deployed overseas to 
help the </SPAN>United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Air Force, which caused some confusion in completing his SCA. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> also gave several potential explanations as to why he did not furnish a complete answer to the 
Government on his SCA, (he did not fully understand the question, he did not realize he had to list all of his liens, he might not have had all of the information available to him regarding the liens, 
and the information he did have only showed that there was a lien of $74,000 placed against him), but he is insistent that he never knowingly gave incorrect information to the Government. While</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> did not give a complete answer regarding his liens, he did list a substantial lien of $74,000 by the IRS, and I find his testimony credible that he did knowingly mislead or misinform the 
Government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with regarding Guidelines F and E:</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. The evidence shows that Applicant has resolved his overdue state taxes, and he 
has made<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a good faith effort to resolve his debt with the IRS. Unfortunately at this time he still owes to the IRS </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $200,000. It is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> hope that this debt may be satisfied in 
</SPAN>February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 2007. But at this time there is no way to know if the IRS will accept </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> offer in compromise. An additional point of concern is that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> again exhibited the conduct that got 
him into trouble previously. It was his failure to file his tax returns in 1989 through 1993 that was the cause of the initial debt to the IRS. The fact that he again filed his returns late for tax years 
2001 through 2003 shows that he may still be subject to some irresponsible financial behavior. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN>under Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations 
and his inability to satisfy his debt to the IRS. I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.6. applies because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue debt to the IRS.  I, 
therefore,  resolve Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> will be eligible to reapply for a security clearance in one year. If he can resolve his federal tax debt by that time, and show continued financial stability, including filing his tax returns in a 
timely manner, then he could be eligible for a security clearance at that time. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence does establish that Applicant provided inaccurate information to the Government in response to question, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#36 </SPAN>on the SCA.  However, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did list a 
significant  lien by the IRS on his SCA, and I conclude that  he did not knowingly provide misinformation to the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>I conclude that no DC applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>under Guideline E. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
