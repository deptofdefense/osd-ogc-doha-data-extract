<P>Applicant has had a history of consuming alcohol to excess, which resulted in four alcohol related arrests and convictions for driving after consuming alcohol.  
The last incident was in 2000, and since that time he no longer consumes alcohol to excess, nor has he driven a vehicle after the consumption of even one drink.  
Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On September 2, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">notarized response, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">September 15, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision 
based on a hearing record b</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">efore a DOHA Administrative Judge.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">November 1, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on December 9, 2004, and the hearing was conducted on January 12, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 8) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his counsel, offered 
six documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - F) and his own testimony and three additional witnesses. The transcript (TR) was received on January 27, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline G of the Directive because of Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption. The SOR contains five 
allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant admits all of the allegations.  The admitted allegations are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 49 years old. He is married and has two children. He is employed as a Field Service Representative by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a 
DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline G - Alcohol consumption). </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant first consumed alcohol regularly when he was 16 or 17 years of age. While he continued drinking, his excessive drinking occurred from 1996 to 
2000, when he was involved with the American Legion. His consumption has decreased significantly since his arrest in 2000 (Tr at 42- 43, 47-48).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's drinking has resulted in at least four alcohol related incidents where he was arrested. They occurred in 1975, 1976, 1997, and 2000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> In January 1975, Applicant   received a Non-Judicial Punishment for Operating a Passenger Vehicle While Drunk. He was ordered to forfeit $180 a month for 
two months (RSOR, Exhibits 1, 3 and 7). In 1976, he charged with Drunk Driving on a Highway, and he was ultimately found guilty of Reckless Driving. He 
was sentenced to one year probation and fined $250 (RSOR, Exhibits 1, 3 and 4). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">For third and fourth incidents, Applicant was arrested and charged with  Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  In 1997, Applicant was found  guilty of  
the DUI charges. He was sentenced to serve 48 hours in jail, three years probation, fined $1, 296, his driver's license was restricted for 18 months, and he was 
ordered to attend a DUI First Offender program (RSOR, Exhibits 1, 3 and 4). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">For the fourth alcohol related arrest, which occurred in 2000, Applicant pled guilty to DUI. He was sentenced to serve 48 hours in jail, five years probation, 
fined $1,716, his driver's license was revoked for six months, and he was ordered to attend weekly DUI classes for 18 months (RSOR, Exhibits 1, 3 and 5). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant testified that, during the period he was consuming alcohol regularly, he drove many times after he had consumed alcohol. He continues to consume 
alcohol although far less frequently, and in far less quantity, since his 2000 arrest. Since that last arrest in 2000, he stated that has never driven a vehicle after 
consuming even one drink and that he never will in the future (Tr at 44-46). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant has never received alcohol counseling or been evaluated as alcoholic or alcohol dependent. Finally, he has never been advised to abstain completely 
from alcohol consumption (Tr at 48-49).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Mitigation</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>  </STRONG>Applicant submitted a number of documents that were extremely favorable to him. These included his performance appraisals for most of the years that he was 
in the United States Air Force, 1973 to 1993, which gave Applicant Outstanding evaluations (Exhibit A).  Exhibit B consisted of three Meritorious Service 
edals that Applicant received during his time in the service. Finally, he submitted seven letters of appreciation and recommendation from  individuals, 
including three Air Force Lieutenant Colonels, who spoke in extremely positive terms about Applicant's exceptional work ability and efforts on behalf of the 
United States military (Exhibits D and  E). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant.  Two were civilians, who had long  military careers, and knew and worked with Applicant for many years. The 
third witness was an active duty Lieutenant Colonel with the Air Force. They all expressed strong support for Applicant as a man of high character.  None of 
them ever witnessed any signs of Applicant having alcohol problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant, on 
the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).</STRONG> While Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol, at times to excess, he was credible when 
he testified that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">he no longer  consumed alcohol to excess,  and since 2000, he has never  driven a vehicle after consuming even one alcoholic drink, nor will he 
do that in the future.  I have also considered </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's long distinguished career in the United States Air Force and the excellent  recommendations that he 
received from a highly distinguished group of individuals. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established that Applicant has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment which is which is 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A7.1.3.2.) is applicable because the problem occurred a number of years ago, in 2000, and there is no indication of a recent 
problem. Also, MC (E2.A7.1.3.3.) applies because of the positive changes in Applicant's behavior supportive of sobriety. Overall, the mitigating conditions 
outweigh the disqualifying conditions, and Guideline G is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding for Applicant as expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
