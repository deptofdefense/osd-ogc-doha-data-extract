<P>Applicant owed eight debts totaling approximately $20,000.  She has paid six of the debts and is making monthly payments on the other two. The record 
evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from Applicant's past finances.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-05275.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On September 
22, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On November 1, 2004, I was assigned the case. On March 14, 2005, I convened a hearing in 
this matter. On March 22, 2005, DOHA received the transcript (tr.) of the hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which were sent on March 17, 2005. Department Counsel having no objection, 
the documents were admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security significant financial considerations. The Applicant admits she had been indebted on the eight debts. That admission is incorporated 
herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 42 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since January 1989 before being laid off because she did not have a clearance.  She is 
seeking to obtain a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's January 2004 (Gov Ex 3) and September 2004 (Gov Ex 5) credit reports indicate Applicant owed eight debts totaling approximately $20,000.  A

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant worked for a defense contractor for 15&frac12; years before being laid off because she did not have a clearance.  Her yearly income was approximately 
$50,000.  Applicant's husband has worked for the DoD since 1984 and his yearly income is approximately $54,000. They purchased their home in 1993.  The 
home is valued at $265,000 and has a mortgage of $150,000. Applicant has sought financial counseling and debt consolidation. (App Ex E) Applicant's has had 
family issues.  Her husband is an alcoholic who has recently come to terms with his problem.  Her son was an abuser of PCP, who was hospitalized for four 
days. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had gotten financially overextended.  She indicates she was young, careless, and irresponsible. She had purchased a car for her son and then one for 
herself.  When her husband was not paying his share of the mortgage, Applicant had to choose between making her car payments and paying the mortgage. She 
chose the mortgage and her car was repossessed. She has since redeemed the repossession and the car is now paid for in full. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has learned not to over indulge in purchases.  She understands the importance of having a good financial status.  She understands the impact of debts 
on her employment. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, (Financial Considerations). A person's relationship with his creditors is a private 
matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating 
or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding 
of a security clearance. Under Guideline F, an applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial 
obligations. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive E.2.A.6.1.1. The Applicant 
admitted owing eight debts totaling approximately $20,000.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1. (E2.A6.1.2.1 <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations.</EM>) 
and 3. (E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has paid six debts.  She is current on her $191 monthly payments on her student loan (SOR 1.c) and current on her $50 monthly payments for her 
lawnmower debt (SOR 1.e). Mitigating Conditions (MC) 6 (E2.A6.1.3.6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) applies.  Applicant has received financial counseling and her financial problems are under control. MC4.  (E2.A6.1.3.4 <EM>The person has received 
or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.</EM>) She has more than $100,000 
equity in her home.  I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
