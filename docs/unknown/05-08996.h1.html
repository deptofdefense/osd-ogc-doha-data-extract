<P>Applicant is 26 years old and works as a systems administrator for a federal contractor. He married in 2001, and became unemployed for four months in 2002. 
His wife was unemployed from April 2002 to May 2003. During this time they had a child in July 2002. Applicant made some poor and immature financial 
decisions and has many delinquent debts that remain unpaid. Based on Applicant and his wife's combined incomes they have very little money remaining at the 
end of each month to pay off their debts. Applicant has made minimal efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On January 3, 2006, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statement of Reason (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (financial considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 25, 2006</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted all 
the allegations in the SOR except &para;&para; 1.b and 1.e. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on March 7, 2006, 
scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 30, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1-5. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, had three character witnesses testify, and 
submitted five exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-E. The exhibits were admitted without objection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on April 10, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 26 years old, has an associates degree, and works as a systems administrator for a federal contractor. He married in 2001, and he and his wife had a 
child in July 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time he married, Applicant was not making a lot of money. From June 2002 to September 2002, Applicant was unemployed.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> From April 2002 to May 
2003, Applicant's wife was unemployed. The couple struggled financially after their child was born and he admitted they made some poor and immature 
financial decisions.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> While unemployed Applicant looked for full-time work and did technical work on a part-time basis. He attempted to take care of his 
family's basic necessities. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided proof he paid the debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.e. He claimed he paid SOR &para; 1.b, but failed to provide documentation.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He has approximately 
$13,250 in undisputed, unpaid delinquent debts alleged in the SOR that he has not made any payments on nor set up payment plans.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> With regard to SOR &para; 1.c, 
a credit card debt for $2,305, he claims he has contacted the company and offered to pay $100 a month, but he has not received confirmation of his proposed 
plan, nor made any payments. The debt remains unpaid. SOR &para; 1.j is a state income tax debt for partial tax years 2003 and 2004, totaling $514. Applicant 
claims there were issues with his wife's past taxes and discrepancies that they disputed with the state. He claims he has contacted the state to resolve the issues, 
but is still waiting for paperwork.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has four debts not listed on the SOR, one with an approximate balance of $600 that he has made payments on.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He owes $245 on a telephone bill that 
has been delinquent for seven to eight months.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He has a payday loan that was due four to five months ago for $500, that remains unpaid.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant has had 
two cars repossessed. One is listed in SOR &para; 1.f that he owes a balance on of $8,200, and the other is not part of the SOR that he owes a balance on of 
approximately $6,000.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The total amount of undisputed delinquent debt that Applicant owes which also includes debts not listed on the SOR is approximately 
$20,500. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has approximately $18,000 in student loans that he is scheduled to start making payments on in December 2006.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He is unsure of what the payments 
will be. He estimates that at the end of the month after paying expenses he and his wife have approximately $300-500 remaining. Applicant claims he and his 
wife have a budget, but they have not really been following it.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character witnesses believe him to be a trustworthy and honest person with impeccable character. They would trust him with money, and personal 
and confidential information.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F- Financial Considerations-a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of 
life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations),</EM> and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3<EM> (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>),<EM> </EM>apply in this case. Applicant has accumulated delinquent debts that remain unpaid. With the amount of 
money he and his wife have left over at the end of each month they are unable to significantly reduce their debt. Applicant has made minimal effort to resolve 
his delinquent debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and especially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>It was an isolated incident), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),</EM> and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).</EM> Applicant owes approximately $13,250 in undisputed debts listed 
in the SOR. He also has approximately another $7,300 in delinquent debts that are not alleged. The debts remain unpaid and because there are many debts, FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.1 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial problems started in 2002, when he had a period of unemployment and at the same time his wife was unemployed. This was also during the 
same time their child was born. These events were largely beyond their control. Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing 
they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control. However, even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances outside his 
control, it is appropriate to consider whether he acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his or her financial difficulties.<A HREF="05-08996.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> It has been over three and a 
half years since Applicant was unemployed for approximately four months. He resumed work in September 2002 and his wife resumed work in May 2003. 
Although Applicant did have intervening events that affected his finances, he has not made attempts to set up payment plans with most of his creditors and has 
not paid most of his debts, even the small ones. He and his wife have a small amount of money left over at the end of the month, but with a child and 
unanticipated intervening events it is unlikely that amount will remain constant. At this point, it is apparent that he does not have the ability to repay his debts 
and, based on the minimal efforts he has made in the past since both he and his wife went back to work, I find he has not initiated a good faith effort to repay his 
creditors or resolve most of his debts. I also find that, although he had financial set backs beyond his control, he did not make reasonable efforts to resolve his 
debts once he and his wife resumed work. Therefore, I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 do not apply. In considering the totality of the 
circumstances, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding Guideline F, financial considerations. Therefore, I am 
persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
