  A credibility determination based solely on a written record is not entitled to the same deference on appeal as a credibility determination based on observation of a witness's demeanor.  The Administrative Judge identified inconsistencies in Applicant's statements about his past use of marijuana that are  sufficient to support his conclusion that Applicant lacked candor about his past use of marijuana.  A credibility determination is not a substitute for record  evidence.  There is no record evidence supporting the Judge's statement that it is possible that Applicant's marijuana use has not yet stopped.  Given the record  evidence in this case, the Judge articulated a rational basis for his conclusion that Applicant had not demonstrated a clear intent to refrain from marijuana in the  future.  Under the Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional security clearance.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 26, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Administrative 
Judge Robert Robinson Gales issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated February 7, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant lacked candor over his past drug abuse; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant had failed to demonstrate a clear intent to not use marijuana in the future; and (3) whether 
Applicant can be granted a security clearance on condition that he undergo random drug testing, submission of future sworn affidavits, or submit to a polygraph 
examination.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant lacked candor over his past drug abuse</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant 
demonstrated a "lack of candor over his past [marijuana] abuse" (Decision at p. 6).  On appeal, Applicant challenges that conclusion, contending that the record 
evidence shows he cooperated with the investigator and disclosed his past marijuana use to the best of his ability.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Because this case was decided on the basis of a File of Relevant Material, not a hearing, the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's credibility and 
candor had to be based, of necessity, on the written record.  The deference owed to a Judge's credibility determinations<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> is premised on the well-established 
legal principle that a Judge who personally observes a witness at the hearing has the opportunity to form impressions about the witness's credibility based on 
the Judge's assessment of the witness's demeanor while testifying.  However, when an applicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her case decided 
by a Judge based on a written record, the Judge has no ability to make a credibility determination based on observation of the applicant's demeanor.  
Accordingly, a credibility determination based solely on a written record is not entitled to the same deference on appeal as a credibility determination based on 
observation of a witness's demeanor.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>In the decision below, the Administrative Judge identified several inconsistencies in Applicant's statements about his marijuana use history.  Apart from those 
inconsistencies, there is no other discernable basis for the Judge's conclusion that Applicant lacked candor about his past marijuana use.  Although the 
inconsistencies identified by the Judge did not compel the Judge -- as a matter of law or logic -- to conclude that Applicant has not always been candid with 
the government about the extent of his past marijuana use, they provide a legally permissible basis for the Judge to reach such a conclusion.  Applicant's appeal 
argument to the contrary is not persuasive.</P> 
<P>Applicant also challenges the Administrative Judge's statement that Applicant may still be using marijuana (Decision at p. 6).  The Judge's conclusion about 
Applicant's lack of candor does not provide a rational or legally permissible basis for the Judge's statement that "it is also possible the substance abuse has not 
yet ceased" (Decision at p. 6).  A credibility determination is not a substitute for record evidence.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's 
challenged statement is not sustainable.  However, this error does not warrant remand or reversal because the Judge's sustainable findings and conclusions 
provide a legally sufficient basis for his unfavorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant had failed to demonstrate a clear intent to not use marijuana in the future</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant failed to demonstrate a clear intent to not use marijuana in the future.  Applicant challenges that conclusion on 
appeal, arguing that the Judge failed to consider his statements "in the context of my interview."</P> 
<P>Given Applicant's admissions and the record evidence about his marijuana use history, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence sufficient to refute, 
explain, extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by his history of marijuana use.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Considering the record as a whole, there is sufficient record 
evidence to allow the  Administrative Judge to reasonably question whether Applicant would refrain from future use of marijuana.  As the Judge noted in the 
decision below, Applicant used marijuana in April 2003 after indicating in a  December 1999 written statement that he did not intend to use it in the future.  
Furthermore, as stated earlier in this decision, the Judge identified inconsistencies in Applicant's statements about his marijuana use that were sufficient to 
allow the Judge to reach an unfavorable conclusion about Applicant's candor concerning his past marijuana use.  Accordingly, the Judge articulated a rational 
basis for his conclusion that Applicant had not demonstrated a clear intent to refrain from marijuana in the future.  Given the clearly consistent with the national 
interest standard, the Judge properly resolved his doubts in favor of the national security.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted a security clearance on condition that he undergo random drug testing, submission of future sworn affidavits, or submit to 
a polygraph examination</SPAN>.  Applicant also states that he is willing to undergo random drug testing, submit sworn affidavits, or undergo a polygraph examination 
in order to get a security clearance.  Under the Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional security clearance.<A HREF="04-04302.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Therefore, the Board cannot grant 
Applicant the kind of relief he requests.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Applicant's appeal brief contains factual assertions that go beyond the record below and seek to supplement the evidence in his case.  Such assertions 
constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Applicant waived his opportunity to 
have a hearing in his case.  Furthermore, Applicant had the opportunity to respond to the File of Relevant Material and submit information for the Judge to 
consider in his case.  Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's decision based on a proffer of evidence on appeal that he did not submit for the Judge to 
consider in his case. 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> As noted earlier in this decision, there is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising claims of error.  Because Applicant 
does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about his past marijuana use, the Board need not address or review those unchallenged findings.
