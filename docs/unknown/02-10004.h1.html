<P>The Applicant's wife is a citizen of India, residing in the U.S.  She is a medical doctor, and has been accepted for a residency position with a prestigious 
American clinic.  His father, mother, sister, mother-in-law, and two sister-in-laws are citizens of and reside in India.  His 78 year old father retired from the 
Indian Army more than 25 years ago.  His 64 year old mother is a housewife, as is his sister.  His mother-in-law retired from a quasi government position five 
years ago.  One of his sisters-in-law is a teacher in a private school, the other is a self-employed medical doctor.  There is no evidence that any of the 
Applicant's family has any connection with a foreign government or is in a position to be exploited by any government.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 13, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 19, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on May 29, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 27, 2003, and the case was heard on July 10, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called  witness to testify on his behalf.  The transcript was 
received on July 21, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived foreign influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.  
[The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">41 years of age, has a Ph. 
D. In electrical engineering, and is employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was born in India in 1961, and came to the United States in 1985 on a student visa to attend a Ph. D. program at an American University 
(Transcript (TR) at page 30 line 19 to page 34 at line 8, <EM>see also</EM> Government Exhibit (GX) I at pages 1~2).  He finished his Ph. D program in 1989, became a 
permanent resident in 1993, and a U.S. citizen in 2000 (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.e.  The Applicant traveled to India three times during the period 1995 to 2000 (TR at page 47 lines 6~19).  His last trip to India was to get married (<EM>id</EM>).  
The Applicant's wife is a citizen of India, but resides in the U.S. (TR at page 36 line4 to page 39 line 11, and at page 40 line 10).  She is a medical doctor, and 
has been accepted for a residency position with a prestigious American clinic (<EM>id</EM>, and Applicant's Exhibits (AppX) D and E).  The father, mother, sister, 
mother-in-law, and two sister-in-laws are all citizens of and reside in India (GX 1 at pages 3~5).  His 78 year old father retired from the Indian Army more than 
25 years ago, and also retired from a non-government position in 1984 (TR at page 44 line 1 to page 45 line 10).  His 64 year old mother has always been a 
housewife (TR at page 45 lines 10~13).  His sister is also a housewife (TR at page 46 line 19 to page 47 line 3).  The Applicant's mother-in-law retired from a 
quasi government position in 1998 (TR at page 42 line 14 to page 43 line 5).  She worked for a geological survey institute (<EM>id</EM>).  One of the Applicant's sisters-in-law is a teacher in a private school, the other is a self-employed medical doctor (TR at page 43 lines 6~18).  The Applicant speaks to his family in India on a 
weekly basis, but never talks about his work (TR at page 43 lines 19~25, and at page 45 line 14 to page 46 line 9).  </P> 
 
<P>1.f.  When the Applicant was a college student in India, from 1983~1985, he received a monthly stipend of $30 from his college department (TR at page 48 line 
14 to page 49 line 24, and at page 50 line 25 to page 51 line 6).  In the U.S., he presently has about $50,000 in a credit union, and $160,000 in a retirement fund 
(AppX F).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's "core manager" testified most laudably on the part of the Applicant (TR at page 24 line 25 to page 29 line 13, <EM>see also</EM> AppX C).  He has 
known the Applicant since 1990 (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's "Senior Manager," a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel who has known the Applicant since 1996, also 
attests to his trustworthiness (AppX G).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's Indian wife resides in the U.S., and, as a medical doctor, has been accepted for a residency position at an American clinic.  His parents, sister, 
mother-in-law, and two sisters-in-law are all citizens of and reside in India.  The Applicant's 78 year old father has long since retired from the Indian Army.  
His mother and sister are both housewives.  His mother-in-law is also retired from a </SPAN>geological survey institute<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  His two sister-in-laws, one a doctor and the 
other a doctor, both work in the private sector.  His Indian family members have no connection with any government, nor is there any evidence that their 
presence in U.S. and India can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would even countenance 
any such attempt at exploitation of any of his relatives.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the $30 a month stipend he received from his university in India during the 1980s, this pales in comparison to his net worth in the U.S.  The last 
disqualifying condition is therefore not applicable.  Guideline B is thus found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P>

clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
