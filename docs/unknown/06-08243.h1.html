<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old divorced mother who has worked for a federal contractor since 2004. She was underemployed and made some poor personal choices several years ago that effected her 
finances. When she became aware that her credit card debt was out of control, she took the initiative and worked with a debt consolidation agency to start repaying her delinquent debts. She has 
consistently followed the plan for more than two years and has made significant strides in reducing her debts. Although she is still repaying her debts, her good faith effort to repay them clearly 
mitigates any trustworthiness concerns. Eligibility for assignment to sensitive positions is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant her eligibility for assignment to information systems positions designated ADP I/II/III.<A HREF="06-08243.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges trustworthiness 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn statement dated May 17, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. Applicant elected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the 
government's file of relevant material (FORM) on June 12, 2006. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
responded on July 11, 2006. The case was assigned to me on July 27, 2006. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old divorced mother of one son who has worked for a government contractor since 2004, as a claims resolution processor. Prior to 2004, she worked in a low paying job, was 
living with a person who failed to pay his share of the household expenses and was remodeling her home so she could sell it. When the home was sold her now ex-boyfriend took the profit from the 
sale. Applicant did not provide clarifying information regarding their financial arrangement on the house. In addition, her son has medical problems and she is responsible for a $750 annual 
deductible payment and other out of pocket expenses. Applicant did not provide any documents to substantiate the medical expenses. </P> 
 
<P>In January 2004, Applicant was hired by her current employer, which paid more money but required her to commute farther away from home with increased transportation expenses. Applicant 
admitted she was overextended on her credit cards and getting behind on the payments in March/April 2004. In approximately February 2004, she sought assistance with a debt consolidation 
agency.<A HREF="06-08243.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She has been making payments to the debt consolidation agency since March 2004. They have in turn been paying some of her debts. The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b and 1.c are the same debt 
that went to judgment in &para; 1.f.<A HREF="06-08243.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She has been making monthly payments of $360 on these accounts/judgment since February 28, 2005 and anticipates the debt to be paid off in full in November 
2006.<A HREF="06-08243.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant's debt in SOR &para; 1.e was settled and paid through her debt consolidation agency in May 2005. The accounts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.d are part of the consolidation plan, but have not 
yet been paid because Applicant is still saving money so a settlement offer can be made by the debt consolidation agency. When Applicant completes the payment plan on the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b 
and 1.c, she will have additional money to pay her remaining debts. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is committed to paying off all of her delinquent debts. Upon entering the debt consolidation program she destroyed all of her credit cards and has not incurred any new debt. She has 
consistently made payments to her consolidation plan since early 2004. Of the five accounts listed in the SOR, one has been settled and paid, two others should be paid by the end of 2006, leaving 
two unpaid. She will start repaying those debts when she finishes paying off the other two. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F .</P> 
 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations),</EM> and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3<EM> (Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>),<EM> </EM>apply in this case. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts and continues to owe creditors. She has made some payments on delinquent debts and resolved them, 
however, she has other debts that she has not paid.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and especially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>It was an 
isolated incident), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),</EM> FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control), </EM>and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).</EM> </P> 
 
<P>Some of Applicant's debts are recent because she has failed to pay them and they are still owed. She had many delinquent debts so her financial problems are not isolated, thus FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 
and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. Applicant was underemployed before she started working at her present employment. She made some poor personal decisions with regard to her ex-boyfriend 
that impacted her finances, but was not fully explained.<A HREF="06-08243.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Although her son may have medical problems, she did not show how this caused her to run into problems beyond her control, with credit 
cards and the expenditures she made to remodel the house. The difficulties she ran into regarding her finances were not from behavior beyond her control. Therefore, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 does not 
apply. Applicant admits she owes the debts listed in the SOR. In 2004, when she became aware that her finances were getting out of control she enlisted a debt consolidation agency to help her set 
up a plan to repay all of her delinquent debts. She had diligently and faithfully followed the plan they instituted and made significant progress in reducing her debts. All of her debts are listed in the 
consolidation plan, although two she has not begun to make payments on. It appears the way the plan works is Applicant makes monthly payments into an account and when she accumulates 
enough money the debt consolidation agency makes a settlement offer to pay off the debt for a reduced amount. Applicant has not sought any financial counseling, and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 does not 
apply. However, she has initiated a good faith effort to resolve all of her delinquencies even if she has not made payments on two of them. They are part of her payment plan and with her continued 
consistent payments it is anticipated they too will be paid in full. It is noted that Applicant started addressing her financial problems before she received the SOR, which indicates her initiative and 
resolve in satisfying her debts. I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 applies. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Whole Person</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's life to 
make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole 
person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I considered that 
Applicant made some poor personal choices with regard to her ex-boyfriend and her finances. However, she took action on her finances and made a concrete repayment plan that she has abided by 
for more than two years. Applicant is obviously committed to resolving her delinquent debts and it is unlikely that she will put herself in this position again. I find Applicant has successfully 
mitigated the trustworthiness concern raised by the financial considerations concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive positions. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant.</P>
