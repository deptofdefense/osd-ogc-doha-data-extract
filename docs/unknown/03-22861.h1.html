<P>Applicant's father, a citizen and resident of the U.S., is a lawyer who has provided legal  services to the Saudi Arabian embassy since 1985, pursuant to an 
annual, renewable, "at will" contract.  Applicant's sister is a citizen of Sudan, a permanent resident of the U.S., and a U.S. government employee who intends to 
become a U.S. citizen.  Applicant visited her extended family in Sudan for one month in 2001 but has had no further contact with them.  The security concern 
based on foreign influence is mitigated.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  It alleges Applicant traveled to Sudan in 2000 
to visit extended family members (&para; 1.a.), her father works for the Saudi Arabian Embassy as an international lawyer (&para; 1.b.), and her sister is a citizen of Sudan 
who resides in the U.S. (&para; 1.c.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 7, 2005, admitted the allegations, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to 
me on July 5, 2005.  On July 22, 2005, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for September 2, 2005.  The case was heard as scheduled, and DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on September 16, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working at a military medical research center.  Her parents were born in Sudan, and they are both 
naturalized U.S. citizens.   Applicant came to the U.S. as a 6-month-old infant, attended grade school, high school and college in the U.S. and was raised as an 
American.  She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in September 1999 along with her parents. She does not speak Arabic, has no contact with or interests in 
Sudan, and has had no contact with her extended family in Sudan except for the one visit in 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is a lawyer, licensed to practice in the U.S. as a foreign legal consultant.  He obtained a law degree from Cairo University in 1976.  He came 
to the U.S. from a suburb of Khartoum, Sudan, in 1979 for postgraduate studies, obtained master's degrees in comparative law and corporation law in the U.S., 
and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He has worked as a contractor for the Commercial Economic Attache's Office in the Saudi Arabian Embassy since 1985.  
He has a one-year contract with the embassy that has been renewed each year until the present.  He works "at will," and either he or the embassy may terminate 
the contract at any time.  He translates U.S. laws into Arabic, advises the embassy on U.S. trade and customs laws, and he acts as a mediator of disputes 
between U.S. and Saudi companies.  He is not a diplomat, has no contact with the diplomatic staff, and takes no part in policymaking or diplomatic activities of 
the embassy.  He has no interaction with the Saudi Minister of Commerce and does not travel to Saudi Arabia.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father also has a private law practice.  Some of his clients are American but most are foreigners.  They include citizens of Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, 
Eritrea, and Senegal.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has five siblings.  Three are native-born U.S. citizens.  Applicant and one sibling became U.S. citizens at the same time their parents were 
naturalized.  Applicant's oldest sister was more than 21 years of age and could not be naturalized as a family member.  She is a permanent U.S. resident, 
working as a temporary employee of the U.S. Government.  She is married to a Sudanese refugee, but they are estranged and living apart.  Applicant's father 
believes they may be divorced or separated.  She has applied for U.S. citizenship, and expects to be naturalized in March 2006.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her family visited Sudan for about one month in 2001, to visit her father's brother, sister, aunt, uncle, and cousins.  They used their U.S. 
passports.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant's father has little contact with his family in Sudan.  He writes a letter to his brother about once a year and talks to his sister every one or 
two years.  His brother was a clerk in the Sudanese Ministry of Telecommunications but is now retired; his sister is a housewife.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A department head in the U.S. government agency supported by Applicant's employer regards her as an "exceptional employee."<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant's immediate 
supervisor for two years, a U.S. citizen holding a security clearance, testified she has been a dedicated and responsible employee.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant's college 
roommate, now working as U.S. Government employee with a security clearance, has known Applicant since high school.  She testified Applicant is a very 
loyal U.S. citizen, and a "very kind, diligent, hardworking individual."<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  A friend and neighbor, also a U.S. Government employee with a security clearance, 
testified she has known Applicant since her high school days and regards her as very dedicated and responsible.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sudan is governed by a military dictatorship with a progovernment parliament.  It has been racked by civil war, with an estimated two million Sudanese killed 
and four million internally displaced.  Sudan has been identified by the U.S. State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  None of Applicant's 
extended family members were affected by the civil unrest in Sudan.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Saudi Arabia is a monarchy with a council of ministers and a consultative council.  Despite economic ties and close cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi 
Arabia on security issues, the U.S. has expressed concern about human rights conditions in Saudi Arabia.  Several terrorist groups operate from within Saudi 
Arabia and receive funding from benefactors in Saudi Arabia.  Relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. were strained after the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001.  Currently, Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the U.S. in the global war on terrorism, providing assistance in the military, diplomatic, 
and financial areas.<A HREF="03-22861.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the

national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is not bound by affection, influence, or obligation to her extended family in Sudan.  She visited her aunt and uncle once in 2001, cannot communicate 
with them because of the language barrier, and has no other contact with them.  However, her sister is a citizen of Sudan.  Thus, DC 1 is established by her 
sister's citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 3) may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  
Applicant's father's contract with the Saudi Arabian embassy establishes DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members . . .  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).  Since 
the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1and DC 3, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly 
governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's father is "connected" with Saudi Arabia, he meets the first prong of MC 1 because he is not an agent of a foreign power.  In 50 U.S.C. &sect; 
1801(b), "agent of a foreign power" is defined as:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any person other than a United States person, who -</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) acts in the United States as an officer or employee of a foreign power, or as a member of a foreign power as defined in subsection (a)(4) [international 
terrorist groups] of this section;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) acts for or on behalf of a foreign power which engages in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States contrary to the interests of the United States, 
when the circumstances of such person's presence in the United State indicate that such person may engage in such activities in the United States, or when such 
person knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of such activities or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in such activities; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) any person who -</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of 
the criminal statutes of the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities for or 
on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in preparation therefore, for or on behalf of a foreign power;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(D) knowingly enters the United States under a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power or, while in the United States, knowingly assumes 
a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E) knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), or knowingly conspires with any person to engage 
in activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father does not fall within &sect; 1801(b)(1) because he is not "a person other than a United States person."  He does not fall within &sect; 1801(b)(2) 
because he is not engaged in clandestine intelligence activity, sabotage or international terrorism, nor has he used a false or fraudulent identity or aided, abetted, 
or conspired with any person to violate &sect;&sect; 1801(b)(2)(A)-(E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board appears to have adopted a definition of "agent of a foreign power" that is broader than the statutory definition, equating it to any employee of 
a foreign government.  In ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 at **4-5 (App. Bd. Jun.29, 2004), the Appeal Board held, "An employee of a foreign 
government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign 
power for purposes of Foreign  Influence Mitigating Condition 1."  The Appeal Board did not mention 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) in its decision and has not discussed 
the applicability of the statutory definition in any of its earlier decisions.  Even under this apparently broader definition, however, Applicant's father is not an 
agent of a foreign power because he is an independent contractor, not an employee of the Saudi Arabian government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father also satisfies the second prong of MC 1.  He is a citizen and resident of the U.S., not subject to the authority of the Saudi government.  He is 
not involved in diplomacy or policymaking.  He is an American lawyer providing legal services to a client.  He is an independent contractor, free to leave at 
will, and not subject to the control of Saudi diplomats.  He has a private law practice and is not wholly dependent on the Saudi government for his livelihood.  
He is not subject to any more foreign influence than any other American lawyer providing legal services to a foreign government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sister clearly is not an agent of a foreign power.  To the contrary, she is an employee of the U.S. Government.  She is estranged from her Sudanese 
spouse.  She soon will be a U.S. citizen.  She is not subject to any greater foreign influence than she would be if she already were a U.S. citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent." Applicant's travel to Sudan in 2001 
has no security significance other than as evidence regarding her attachment to her extended family.  Applicant's contact with her extended family in Sudan 
began and ended with her one-time visit in 2001.  During that visit, her contact was limited by the language barrier.  MC 3 is established for her extended 
family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, considering the totality of Applicant's family ties as well as each individual family tie, and 
evaluating all the evidence on the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern based on foreign influence.</SPAN></P>
