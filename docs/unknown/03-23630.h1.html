<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 5, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline H (drugs) and Guideline E (personal conduct) which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 27, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant 
material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was received by Applicant on January 18, 2005.  Applicant was 
afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by February 17, 2005.  Applicant declined to submit a 
response to the FORM.  The case was  assigned to me on March 17, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted to all seven of the SOR allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline H (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.), and admitted 
the three allegations of personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a. through c.).  However, his explanations to 2.b. and c. amount to denials and will 
be treated accordingly.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I 
make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a married 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He was employed by this contractor in 1980.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  He 
obtained a security clearance in 1986 but was denied a security clearance in 1995, and was denied a special access clearance by the Air Force in 2001, due to 
drug involvement.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He has a history of marijuana, psilocybin (mushrooms), and cocaine usage for over 20 years.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He continued use of marijuana and cocaine 
during employment with a defense contractor from 1980 until at least 2004, and during the time he held a security clearance issued in 1986.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN>  During a 1995 
interview he admitted prior drug use but that he planned no future drug use.  Despite that assertion, he used marijuana within weeks of that interview and 
cocaine on several occasions up until June 2000.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN>  </P> 
<P>On a security clearance application in 2000, Applicant failed to list any drug usage after 1994.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He further states "Have no instances of use in last 6 years and 
no further intention of use."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN>  When interviewed in 2001, he admitted marijuana and cocaine use in 1995.  It was only after a polygraph examination that he 
admitted to cocaine use between 1996 and 2000.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> </P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted that he intentionally falsified his December 2000 security clearance application.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN>  His reply to question<EM> " <STRONG>27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs 
and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs</STRONG>.  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for 
example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, 
methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs</EM>?" was "Yes", that he used marijuana from January 1, 1983 to 
October 1, 1994 and that he used cocaine from October 1, 1983 to July 31, 1994.  He admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose marijuana use to 1995 and 
cocaine use until June 2000.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>On a December 2000 security clearance application, he was required to answer question<EM> "<STRONG>28. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensative 
Positions</STRONG>.  Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while 
possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety?</EM>"  He answered: "No."  To the same question on a 
February 2002 application he answered "No."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant explained his responses in his answer to the SOR stating he thought the interpretation of security 
clearance referred to a special access clearance like the one he was applying for, not the DoD clearance.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P> </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-23630.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline H (drug involvement) (DI), Directive, &para; E2.A8.1.1. <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions 
regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, 
increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 14pt">; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> </EM>and Guideline E (personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline H.  Applicant admitted the use of marijuana, psilocybin (mushrooms), and cocaine over more than 
twenty years, and admitted each  allegation of Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  He used cocaine to at least June 2000.  He continued his drug involvement after being 
granted a security clearance in 1986.  In the past he has stated he would not use drugs in the future but has returned to his old patterns of drug usage.  His failure 
to be truthful about his past drug abuse make his assertions that he has not used drugs since 2000 and "no future use intended" lack credibility.  Disqualifying 
Conditions DI include E2.A8.1.2.1 <EM>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</EM>: [1] E2.A8.1.2.1.<EM> (Any drug abuse)</EM>; and [2] 
E2.A8.1.2.2. (<EM>Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>) are applicable in this case.  The only 
mitigating factor that could apply is MC DI E2.A8.1.3.3 <EM>(A demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future)</EM>.  Applicant's pattern and lengthy history of 
drug usage and his continuing use in spite of declarations of future abstinence vitiate any applicability of this mitigating condition.  His promises lack 
believability.  I find the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through f. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  questions on his security clearance applications on two different submissions in 2000 and 2002, 
by omitting periods of drug use and by his denial of using drugs while holding a security clearance.  These come under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct 
Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2.<EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant explained his answers by saying he thought the 
questions pertained to a special access clearance and not a DoD security clearance.  In either case, he still answered the questions falsely.  It matters not what 
type of clearance he thought the questions referenced.  The issue is that he did not truthfully answer the questions.  Other than these explanations he offered no 
other rebuttal evidence.  No mitigating conditions are applicable.  I conclude SOR allegation 2.a., b. and c. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
