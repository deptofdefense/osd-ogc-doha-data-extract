<P ALIGN="CENTER"><EM>Pro se</EM></P>

<P>Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson issued a decision, dated April 22, 1997, in which
she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant. Applicant appealed. For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security
clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
November 13, 1996 to Applicant. The SOR was based on Criterion G (Alcohol Consumption). </P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he indicated he wanted a decision made in
his case without a hearing. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), a
copy of which was provided to Applicant. After Applicant's response to the FORM was received,
the case was assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination. The Judge subsequently
issued a decision in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The case is before the Board on Applicant's
appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Discussion</STRONG></P>

<P>The Administrative Judge made findings about Applicant's history of alcohol abuse, which
spanned the period 1971 to June 1996 and included multiple alcohol-related incidents. Applicant
does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about his history of alcohol abuse. Rather,
Applicant asserts: (1) he is currently receiving professional assistance to maintain his sobriety;
(2) he is currently enrolled in an alcohol rehabilitation program and supplements it by attending
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; (3) his program manager/security officer supports his efforts;
and (4) he has not had any security violations. The Board construes Applicant's brief as raising
the issue of whether the Judge's adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.</P>

<P>The favorable evidence cited by Applicant on appeal was before the Administrative Judge. There
is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge
specifically states otherwise. Apart from that presumption, a reading of the decision shows the
Judge considered the record evidence concerning Applicant's overall history of alcohol abuse,
including Applicant's past and current efforts at rehabilitation. Accordingly, the Board concludes
the Judge carried out her responsibility under Section F.3. to consider all the record information,
both favorable and unfavorable.</P>

<P>The favorable evidence cited by Applicant on appeal does not preclude an adverse security
clearance decision in his case. When the Administrative Judge weighs the evidence, both
favorable and unfavorable, the Judge must consider whether the favorable evidence outweighs
the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. <EM>Cf. Carosella v. U.S. Postal Service</EM>, 816 F.2d 638, 643
(Fed. Cir. 1987) (agency has discretion to balance seriousness of employee's conduct against
applicable mitigating factors). Absent a showing of arbitrary or capricious action by the Judge,
the Board will not disturb the Judge's weighing of the evidence. Here, Applicant has failed to
demonstrate the Judge's evaluation of the record evidence was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.</P>

<P>The absence of any security violations by Applicant does not preclude an adverse security
clearance decision. The government need not wait until an applicant commits a security violation
before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 238-39
(D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). All that is required is proof of facts and
circumstances that indicate a particular applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information,
or does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of
persons granted access to classified information. Alcohol abuse, even if it occurs during off-duty
hours, poses a security risk. <EM>Cole v. Young</EM>, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); <EM>Croft v. Department
of Air Force</EM>, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989). Given the record evidence of Applicant's overall
history of alcohol abuse, the Judge had a rational basis for her adverse security clearance
decision.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below. Accordingly, the
Board affirms the Administrative Judge's April 22, 1997 decision.</P>
