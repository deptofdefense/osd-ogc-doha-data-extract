<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 53-year-old defense contract employee. He willfully failed to file federal and state tax returns from 2001 until 2003. Despite subsequent filings 
and payments in 2005, Applicant did not mitigate the criminal conduct concern, personal conduct, and financial considerations. Applicant also has a history of

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (<EM>Directive)</EM>, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, because of security concerns arising under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated August 30, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR. He elected to have his case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on October 31, 2005. Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions. Applicant received the FORM on November 9, 2005. Applicant  submitted additional information on December 8, 2005. The case was assigned to 
me on December 19, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline H  (subparagraphs 4.a. through 4.o) of the SOR. Those admissions 
are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied all factual allegations under SOR subparagraphs 1, 2, and 3, (Guidelines J, E, and F respectively). After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a single,<STRONG> </STRONG>53-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance. On July 14, 2003, he submitted his security clearance 
application.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In 1973, Applicant held a security clearance while working for the Air Force.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1985, he registered a business in his state which constituted a primary source of income from 1985 until 1989, and a large source of income for 2000 and 
2001. The business is still active but amounts to 2% of his income. State law requires filing a semiannual gross receipts statement. Applicant did not file his 
statement for the period of January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2001 on a timely basis.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for years 2000 through 2003 in a timely manner. The IRS notified Applicant numerous times to comply with 
the law.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> In addition, Applicant did not file his state income tax returns for the same time period. As of February 10, 2005, Applicant by his own admission, had 
not filed.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The summary and status of Applicant's federal and state income tax returns for 2001 until 2003 is as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2000, Applicant owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $3,900.0. He did not file a return, nor did he pay the tax ($5,140.00 interest and penalty) 
until December 5, 2005, well after he received the SOR.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2000, he also owed the state $450.00. He filed the state tax return in 2005, but has not paid the tax. <A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2001, Applicant did not file his federal tax return. He filed in 2005 and received a refund of $1,881.00.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2001, Applicant did not file his state tax return. He owed the state $11.45. He filed in late 2005 and paid the tax liability of $11.45 on November 
28, 2005. <A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2002, Applicant received a refund of $1,964.00 from the IRS. In 2003, he requested an extension for filing  tax year 2002 return. In 2002, he made 
a payment to the IRS in the amount of $1,800.00. He filed state tax for tax year 2002 in late 2005. He is awaiting a refund.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For tax year 2003, Applicant filed his federal and state tax return in 2005. He received a refund from the state for $1,033.00 in 2005.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2004, Applicant paid $850.00 in state taxes. In April 2004, he paid $6,747.00 to the IRS for tax year 2000.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, Applicant filed and paid his federal and state income tax  for the tax years 2001-2003. He also received refunds in 2005, and filed and paid his 
2001 semiannual business receipts for 2001 in 2005. Applicant denies this was willful failure because he is not a good record-keeper, throws receipts into 
boxes, and returned to school part-time in 2000. He also claims he was in touch with the federal and state tax agents  concerning the filings over the years.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an extensive history with illegal drugs by his own admission. He admits to use, purchase and cultivation of marijuana. In 1981 he used cocaine, 
hash, opium, peyote, psilocybin, amphetamines, LSD, as well as other recreational drugs. His drug use spans a period of thirty years between 1970 and 2002. 
Applicant abstained for certain periods of time during the years.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant participated in an eight-week drug treatment program after testing positive for marijuana in an Employer random drug test. His stated reason 
for the participation is threat of termination from employment. After that, he elected to continue marijuana use.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> He did not receive counseling or treatment 
after 1996. He acknowledged his recreational drug use in the 1970's occurred when he was working for the U.S. Air Force, with a clearance, in his home state. 
He believes there was no policy concerning drug use at that time.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's 
eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility 
for access to classified information (mitigating conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2, Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Because the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Process factors to consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Protecting national security is the paramount 
concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly consistent with the interest 
of national security. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J- Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E- Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Consideration: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H -Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation 
sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the applicant's clearance.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of national security.<A HREF="04-10601.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be, "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned." Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. 
Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with 
respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is essential for 
one who is granted access to the nation's secrets.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case as to allegations 1.a. through 1.d. Applicant's willful failure to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2000-2003 is 
a violation of 27 U.S.C.&sect; 7203. Under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 <EM>(allegations or admissions of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant did not pay the taxes or file his tax returns for 2000-2003 until December 2005, after the SOR allegations to determine whether his security clearance 
should be continued. The IRS sent notices over the years to Applicant, but he did not supply any information or comply with the law until late 2005. Applicant 
is a mature adult who has been employed and subject to federal and state income taxes for most of his adult life. He offered no explanation or excuse for his 
failure to file timely federal tax returns other than the fact he was a poor record keeper and could not afford to pay his taxes because he returned to school full 
time in 2000. I infer this is willful failure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply. Nor does CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>the crime was 
an isolated incident</EM>) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's pattern of not paying taxes continued for four years. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 <EM>(there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) does not apply 
despite the subsequent filing. Applicant was motivated by the SOR allegations and impact on his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also did not file his state taxes for 2000-2003 until 2005. He violated a state statute, which requires residents to file a complete tax return on an 
annual basis. The government established its case under Guideline E, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (<EM>reliable, unfavorable 
information provided by associates, employers</EM>,<EM> coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances). </EM>Applicant presented no information to mitigate the personal 
conduct concern.<EM> </EM>I<EM> </EM>conclude the substantial evidence is reliable and shows highly questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with the law.<EM> </EM>PC MC 
E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>) 
also applies in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial</STRONG> <STRONG>Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline F. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting 
financial obligations), </EM>and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 ( <EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply<EM>.</EM> Applicant failed to resolve his tax liabilities until late 2005. 
He did not file federal or state returns from 2000 until 2003, nor pay his tax until 2004 and 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>the</EM> <EM>behavior was not recent) </EM>and<EM> </EM>FC MC<EM> </EM>E2.A6.1.3.2<EM> (the behavior was an 
isolated event). </EM>Neither applies<EM> </EM>in this case for the reasons already discussed under Guideline J above. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control</EM>). Applicant's time management 
challenges concurring with part time employment, and poor record keeping were clearly within his control. I conclude this FC MC does not apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 <EM>(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) </EM>is a possible mitigating condition. 
Applicant did not file returns until well after the DSS investigation and SOR. He did make two payments in 2004, but his reliance on the 2004 payments is not 
sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. His tax liability was outstanding, and Applicant chose to file and pay only after he feared a loss of security 
clearance. This is not a good faith effort. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations. Allegations 3.a. to 3.d. are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's record is replete with experimental illegal drug use by his own admission. (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>any drug abuse),</EM>and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (<EM>Illegal 
drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution) </EM>apply. DI DC E2.A8.1.2.3 (<EM>diagnosis by a credentialed medical 
professional</EM>) does not apply in this case. There is no record of such a diagnosis here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1970 until at least 2002, Applicant was involved with illegal drugs. Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>the drug involvement 
was not recent</EM>) and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (<EM>the</EM> <EM>drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event) </EM>do not apply<EM>. </EM>Applicant ended his written responses to the 
SOR with the statement, "I do not intend future use." Given his history and disregard for rules, I find this insufficient proof of intent. DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3<EM> (a 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future) </EM>does not apply<EM>. </EM>DI MC<EM> </EM>E2.A8.1.3.4<EM> (satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including rehabilitation and after care requirement, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional)</EM> do not 
apply. Applicant did not receive any after care treatment. Also, there is no reliable information concerning successful completion of the 1996 employer referral 
program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts<EM> </EM>his drug use was experimental and a result of youthful indiscretions<EM>.</EM> He<EM> </EM>also noted this occurred many years ago, including a time in the 
1970's when he worked for the U.S. Air Force and had a security clearance. However, his marijuana use continued until 2002 when he was approximately 50 
years old. Applicant is now a mature man.<EM> </EM>Considering all the evidence in this case, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the drug involvement concerns in 
the SOR. Accordingly, allegations 4.a through 4.o of the SOR are concluded against<STRONG> </STRONG>Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all the circumstances in light of the "whole person concept." I conclude Applicant is not eligible for eligible for access to classified 
information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
