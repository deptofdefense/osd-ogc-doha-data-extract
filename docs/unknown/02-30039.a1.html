  The presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence is not rebutted or overcome by a showing that the Judge did not give certain record evidence as much weight as the appealing party would have liked.  The mere presence or absence of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying  or mitigating conditions is not dispositive of a case.  In addition to applying pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines, a Judge must evaluate an  applicant's security eligibility in light of the record evidence as a whole and in terms of the general factors of Directive, Section 6.3 and Adjudicative  Guidelines, Item E2.2.1.   In addition to Applicant's admissions that she lied to an investigator in June 2002 about her 1991 larceny incident, there is sufficient  circumstantial record evidence to support the Judge's findings that Applicant falsified her security clearance application.  Applicant has not shown that the  Judge's conclusions under Guideline E or Guideline J are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">------------------, Personal Representative</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 12, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated May 23, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that security concerns stemming from Applicant's 
1991 felony larceny conviction could not be mitigated; (2) whether the Administrative Judge improperly shifted the burden to Applicant to prove that she did 
not falsify her security clearance application; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant had not mitigated security concerns 
stemming from her falsifications is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that security concerns stemming from Applicant's 1991 felony larceny conviction could not be 
mitigated</SPAN>.  Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred by not mitigating the security significance of her 1991 conviction  because the following 
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions applied: (a) it was not recent;<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (b) it was an isolated incident<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> as her only brush with the criminal justice system; (c) 
she was pressured into committing the act because she was a single mother with two children and with "a lot of uncertainties," little education, and a lot of 
expenses, but these conditions are no longer present in her life;<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> (d) the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> because she no longer works in 
the "hopeless" conditions that existed in the past; and (e) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> because she completed her sentence, did not 
commit any further criminal behavior, went to school and earned her degree, and now works for an employer who has given her positive work reviews.  
Applicant seeks a "plenary review" by the Board because the Administrative Judge "did not consider nor make note of any of the positive changes and possible 
mitigating security concerns" described above.</P> 
<P>The Board is not persuaded by Applicant's arguments.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless 
the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  The presumption that the Judge considered all the record 
evidence is not rebutted by a showing that the Judge did not give certain evidence as much weight as the appealing party would have liked.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 03-09485 (July 8, 2004) at p. 3.  Here, the Judge found that Applicant had not engaged in theft-related conduct after 1991, and concluded that such 
criminal behavior was not recent.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant's pursuit of her college degree and work contributions reflect positively on her.  But 
the mere presence or absence of any Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating factor is not dispositive of the case.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-11448 (August 10, 2004) at pp. 3-4.  In addition to applying pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines, a Judge must evaluate an applicant's security 
eligibility in light of the record evidence as a whole and in terms of the general factors of Directive, Section 6.3 and Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.1.  The 
Administrative Judge also concluded that Applicant's conduct was neither remote in time nor isolated in nature because Applicant intentionally misrepresented 
material facts to the government regarding her 1991 conviction and lacks remorse for the 1991 incident.<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses 
and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that significant 
doubts persist about Applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The Judge's conclusions reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of record 
evidence and are sustainable.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge improperly shifted the burden to Applicant to prove that she did not falsify her security clearance application</SPAN>.  Applicant 
correctly points out that when a falsification allegation is controverted, the Department Counsel has the burden of proving an intent to falsify or mislead.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.14.  We construe Applicant's position to be that Department Counsel had demonstrated the omission of 
information only and not an intent to falsify.  The Board is not persuaded by Applicant's argument.</P> 
<P>Applicant is correct that proof of an omission of information, standing alone, does not establish or prove the intent or state of mind of the person who omitted 
the information.  Rather, an Administrative Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence 
concerning the applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (June 9, 2004) at p. 5.  In this case, the 
Judge had a legally sufficient basis for finding that Applicant engaged in deliberate falsification.</P> 
<P>A review of the record below shows that the Administrative Judge had more than just evidence of an omission.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted that she lied 
to an investigator in her June 2002 written statement about the 1991 larceny (SOR paragraph 2.c).  <EM>See</EM> Hearing Transcript at p. 13.  <EM>See also</EM> Government 
Exhibit 5 (Applicant's August 2002 written statement)(admitting Applicant's previous statements about 1991 incident "were not truthful"). Moreover, there are 
inconsistencies among Applicant's various statements about her omissions on the security clearance application.  In addition to observing Applicant's demeanor 
during her hearing testimony, the Judge could consider the inconsistencies among Applicant's statements in assessing her credibility and veracity.  Given the 
totality of the documentary evidence, Applicant's hearing testimony, and the deference owed to the Judge's credibility determination, the Board concludes there 
is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified the security clearance application as alleged in SOR paragraphs 2.a 
and 2.b.  The Judge's findings of falsification reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record evidence.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant had not mitigated security concerns stemming from her falsifications is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts that the Judge erred by not concluding that the security significance of any  falsifications on her part had been mitigated.  
Applicant argues that the Judge only considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and did not consider other mitigating conditions that applied to her.  
Applicant argues that Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> applied to her because her falsification of the clearance application was an "isolated" event 
that happened "three years ago," and the subsequent "correct information" was introduced by the Department Counsel at the hearing.<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant also 
contends that two other mitigating conditions applied to her: (a) Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> because she "left the retail environment," 
completed her education, got married, and acquired a better and higher paying jobs with great job reviews; and (b) Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7<A HREF="02-30039.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
because she is now closely associated with her husband, children and work associates, and her husband has no criminal history.</P> 
<P>As in the application of the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, the burden of persuasion in mitigation lies with Applicant.  The Administrative Judge 
properly considered mitigation here under Mitigating Condition 3 and would not have been justified in applying Mitigating Condition 2.  <EM>See, </EM>e.g.<EM>,</EM> ISCR Case 
No. 02-15003 (March 17, 2005) at p. 4; and ISCR Case No. 01-06166 (October 25, 2001) at p. 3 (discussing the difference between Personal Conduct 
itigating Condition 2 and Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3).  Moreover, as discussed above, the Administrative Judge specifically considered much 
of the favorable evidence that Applicant claims that the Judge failed to consider, but found such evidence to be insufficient to overcome security concerns in 
this case given Applicant's current lack of candor and remorse with respect to the 1991 incident.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge weighed the 
evidence as a whole in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  Nor has Applicant demonstrated that the Judge erred in her application of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines pertaining to Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The Judge's conclusions under Guideline E are sustainable.</P>
