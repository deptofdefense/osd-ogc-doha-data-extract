<P>When Applicant applied for a security clearance, her credit report reflected delinquent debts to 11 separate creditors totaling about $18,000.00.  After receiving 
the Statement of Reasons (SOR), she paid two debts totaling about $1,200.00.  She rebutted a delinquent auto loan.  She answered "no" to two questions on her

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 10, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 10, 2003.  She admitted all but one of the allegations under Guideline F, denied the allegations she 
falsified her SF 86 under Guideline E, offered explanations, and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The case was assigned to me on July 29, 2004, but was held in abeyance 
because Applicant, a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, had been recalled to active duty in November 2003 and deployed overseas from February 2004 to 
February 2005.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  She was released from active duty in March 2005 and returned to her civilian employment.  She was recalled to active duty again from May 31 
to June 29, 2005.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2005, Applicant's employer notified DOHA she had been released from active duty and had returned to her civilian employment.  On August 1, 
2005, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for August 19, 2005, and the case was heard as scheduled.  I kept the record open until September 6, 
2005, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  I received several additional documents on September 2, 2005, and they are incorporated 
in the record as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) K through R.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 27-year-old senior logistics specialist for a defense contractor.  She has worked for her current employer since August 2002.  She served in the 
U.S. Army as an automated logistics specialist from June 1996 to August 2002 and was recalled to active duty as noted above.  She was married in January 
1997 and has three children, ages eight, six, and three.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When she began her civilian employment in August 2002, she executed a SF 86.  She disclosed an automobile repossession in response to question 35, but she 
answered "no" to questions 38 (debts more than 180 days delinquent) and 39 (debts more than 90 days delinquent).  In the "general remarks" section of her SF 
86, she wrote: "[M]y credit [is] not good.  I'm working on consolidating all my bills."  Her credit report dated September 3, 2002, reflected delinquent debts to 
11 separate creditors totaling about $18,000.00.  All these debts were unpaid and had been charged off or turned over to collection agencies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 21, 2002, Applicant was interviewed about her delinquent debts by a security investigator.  In a sworn statement, she declared, "I can afford to pay 
these bills now because I'm a contractor and my income has doubled."<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In a personal financial statement dated July 21, 2003, submitted in response to a 
financial interrogatory from a security investigator, she indicated a monthly net remainder of $420.36.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant's pay while she was recalled to active duty 
was about $3,000.00 per month.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In her present civilian employment, her net pay is about $3,795.00 per month.  She earns a net pay of about $250.00 per 
month in the Army Reserve.  Her monthly expenses are about $1,774.00 per month, leaving a remainder of about $2,271.00.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred while Applicant was on active duty in the Army and before her recall to active duty for service in Kuwait and 
Iraq.  The bad check (SOR &para; 1.e.) dates back to 1997.  Applicant did not pay off any debts alleged in the SOR until after she received it.  She has not enrolled in 
any debt counseling programs.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant was recalled to active duty, she depended on her husband to take care of the children and pay the bills.  Her husband had access to their joint 
bank account and had a power of attorney from Applicant.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Her military pay was deposited in the joint bank account.  Her husband stopped working and 
stopped communicating with her.  When Applicant returned from overseas, she learned he had not paid the bills.  He had moved out of their apartment, stopped 
paying the rent, left the children with Applicant's parents, and moved to another state.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Applicant is not receiving any money from her husband to support the 
children.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She communicates occasionally with her husband but has not seen him since July 2004, when she came home on leave.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  For most of their 
marriage, her husband has worked sporadically and "liked to splurge," leaving Applicant primarily responsible for supporting the family.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

she did not submit any evidence of the payment.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The delinquent auto loan alleged in the SOR &para; 1.k. was incurred when Applicant's husband purchased an auto in 1996 and his mother cosigned the loan.  The 
lender would not allow Applicant to cosign the loan because she had just financed her own auto.  Applicant's husband lost his job and the auto was repossessed.  
As far as Applicant knows, the deficiency on the loan is unpaid.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  This debt is not attributable to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified she did not have her credit report when she executed her SF 86.  When she tried to answer "yes" to questions 38 and 39 regarding delinquent 
debts, the computer program asked for specifics.  Because she did not have specific information, she changed her answers to "no" and added a comment under 
"general remarks" that her credit was not good.<A HREF="03-01483.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline F, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline F could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an 
applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Applicant's financial history establishes DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they were not recent (MC 1) or an isolated incident (MC 2).  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  MC 1 is not established because Applicant's financial problems have continued to the present.  MC 2 is not established because she 
has numerous delinquent debts spanning several years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems also can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.4.  The record shows two conditions beyond Applicant's control: and her recall to active duty and her husband's financial irresponsibility 
while she was deployed overseas.  However, I conclude MC 3 is not established because all the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred and delinquent before 
Applicant was recalled to active duty.  Applicant was seriously in debt before she began her civilian employment.  Although she worked for her present 
employer from August 2002 until November 2003 and earned twice as much as she earned while in the Army, she made virtually no progress with her financial 
problems.  Two of the largest delinquent debts, the purchase of military clothing (SOR &para; 1.g.) and the auto repossession (SOR &para; 1.j.), were incurred by 
Applicant, not her financially irresponsible husband.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her husband's financial irresponsibility after she was recalled and deployed was not the cause of the debts alleged in the SOR, but it made it more difficult for 
Applicant to resolve them because she was confronted with the additional debts incurred by her husband.  However, e</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ven where there circumstances outside an 
applicant's control, an administrative judge may consider whether an applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with financial difficulties.  ISCR 
Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has assumed responsibility for supporting the family for as long as she has been married.  She was 
aware of her husband's tendency to splurge, as evidenced by his ill-advised purchase of an automobile, soon repossessed, in 1996.  Nevertheless, she deposited 
her pay in a joint account to which her husband had access and gave him her power of attorney, knowing his record of financial irresponsibility. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A good-faith effort to repay or resolve debts is a mitigating condition (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concept of good faith "requires a showing that a 
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR Case No. 99-9020, <EM>supra</EM> at *5, quoting ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Evidence of past irresponsibility is not necessarily mitigated by payment of debts only 
under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude MC 6 is not established.  Even though Applicant was questioned twice by security investigators and knew her financial situation was a security 
concern, she did not resolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR until after she received it.  The bad check (SOR &para;1.e.) had languished for almost eight years 
before she resolved it.  Although she currently has a net monthly remainder of about $2,272.00, she had not resolved several small debts as of the date of the 
hearing.  Even though I gave her additional time to present documentation pertaining to a substantial payment on one debt, she failed to produce it, request 
additional time, or offer explanation why she could not produce it.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-00012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999) (failure to present documentation 
in support of claims about financial matters is relevant factor.). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I am not convinced she has changed her financial habits or attitude about indebtedness.  After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concern based on financial considerations.</SPAN></P>

rules and regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A deliberate omission or falsification 
of relevant and material facts from a personal security questionnaire is a disqualifying condition (DC 2).  Directive &para;E2.A5.1.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification 
allegation is controverted, the department counsel has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct 
or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 
2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude DC 2 is not established.  Applicant's explanation was plausible and supported by the record.  Her disclosure of her bad credit record in the SF 86 is 
consistent with lack of intent to conceal her financial situation.  Having heard Applicant's testimony and observed her demeanor, I found her credible on this 
issue.  While Applicant's explanation suggests negligence, I am satisfied she did not intentionally falsify her SF 86.</SPAN></P>
