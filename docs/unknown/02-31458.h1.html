<P>The Government substantiated security concerns over Applicant's foreign preference because of his dual citizenship and use of a foreign passport from Iran 
after he became a naturalized United States (US) citizen in August 2000.  He failed to comply with the Department of Defense (DoD) policy requirements to 
relinquish his foreign passport issued in August 1999.  He stated his intent to renew it when it expired in August 2004.  Although he has relatives who are 
citizens of a foreign country, they do not have ties to the government. Only his brother remains in Iran while both his mother and mother-in-law now reside in 
the U.S.   While he mitigated the allegations of foreign influence, concerns remain over foreign preference.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government could not reach the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the Applicant,<A HREF="02-31458.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> so the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on June 10, 2003.  The 
SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C) and in paragraph 2 over foreign influence (Guideline B).  Applicant 
received the SOR and replied to these SOR allegations in an Answer forwarded on July 7, 2003, wherein he admitted all of the allegations and requested a 
decision without a hearing.  </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on October 8, 2003, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which she then forwarded to Applicant 
for reply within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on October 21, 2003, but submitted no evidence in reply.  On March 5, 2004, the case was 
assigned to me.  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 35 years old, has worked at a defense contractor in State #1 from November 2000 to present.  He completed an Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) in February 2001.  (Exhibit 4)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant received a B.S. degree in 1992 from a university in State #1.  (Exhibit 4)  Applicant married a U.S. citizen in 1999; they have one child born in July 
2001 who is a U.S. citizen.  (Exhibits  4, 5) </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran.  He was born in Iraq of parents who were citizens of Iran and teaching school in Iraq.  He moved to the U.S. in 
the1984 to go to high school and college and has been a resident of the U.S. since that time.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen<A HREF="02-31458.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> in August 2000 and has a 
U.S. passport issued in August 2000.  He has maintained his dual citizenship and his Iranian passport in order to visit his family in Iran as his mother and 
brother remain citizens of Iran.  Indeed the 2002 U.S. Department of State Consular Information Sheet on</P> 
 
<P> Iran suggests that U.S.-Iranian dual citizens use their Iranian passports to enter Iran.  (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 8)  Applicant would have an obligation to serve in the 
Iranian military if he lived there, but he has no intention to live in Iran.  He has no intention to serve in the U.S. military.  He has no financial interest or 
property in Iran; however, his mother owns a home valued at $40,000 in Iran which he might inherit.  (Exhibits 3, 4, 5)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG> Failure to Surrender Foreign Passport </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In March 2002 Applicant advised DSS that he chose "not to relinquish" his Iranian passport as he intends to travel there in the future.  If he was to travel to Iran 
on his U.S. passport, upon arrival in Iran, his U.S. passport would be seized and not returned to him.  In October 2003 Applicant  receiving the FORM 
including the ASD(C<SUP>3</SUP>I) guideline<A HREF="02-31458.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> which mandates that applicants for a security clearance surrender a foreign passport. Applicant provided no evidence that he 
sought guidance from the DoD as to how he could then comply with this guideline.  There is no evidence that he complied by returning his Iranian passport to 
the embassy to request that it be cancelled in order to comply with DoD security guidelines.  (Exhibits 5, 7,  9)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother is a citizen of Iran, but in July 2003 become a resident of the U.S.   His mother is a retired teacher.  When his mother lived in Iran, he 
provided financial assistance to her as his father is deceased.  His brother works in the private sector in Iran.  He has limited contact with his other relatives who 
live there.   His mother-in-law is a citizen of Iran who has lived in the U.S. for over twenty years; he has frequent contact with her; he and his wife helped to 
support her for the first year of their marriage.  There is no evidence that any relative has contact with the government of Iran or has been subject to pressure.  
(Exhibits 3, 4, 5)  The 2003 Consular Information Sheet on Iran provides guidelines for  U.S. citizens.  While the State Department guidance does advise that 
foreign visitors may be placed under surveillance,  Applicant stated that he believed he was never under surveillance when he has traveled to Iran for visits to 
his family. (Exhibits 3, 4, 8)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility divided into conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's 
access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the 
evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed the following relevant Adjudication Guidelines:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</STRONG>:</P> 
 
<P>(1)  The exercise of dual citizenship; </P> 
 
<P>(2)  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport<A HREF="02-31458.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)   An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)    A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order</P> 
 
<P> to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may 
be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference     </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>A citizen of Iran by birth, Applicant came to the United States in 1984 to pursue his education and in 1992 earned a B.S. degree.  He became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 2000, and subsequently obtained a United States passport.  Applicant continued also to maintain his Iranian passport, and planned to 
renew it for travel to Iran when it expired in August 2004.  This active pursuit of a benefit of his foreign citizenship places him in the position of being subject 
to the duties or obligations owed to two different countries, and raises the potential of him being subject to competing claims. Under the adjudicative guidelines 
pertinent to foreign preference, disqualifying conditions (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. the exercise of dual citizenship and E2.A3.1.2.2. possession and/or use of a foreign 
passport must be considered in evaluating Applicant's security worthiness.  While Applicant derives his foreign citizenship from his birth to parents who were 
citizens of Iran, security concerns are created by his exercise of a benefit of that foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen; he has maintained his foreign 
passport without any official approval or sanction by the United States Government.  Maintenance of dual citizenship itself is not per se disqualifying as 
feelings of affection and even a degree of affiliation for the land of one's birth are understandable. The security concern is whether Applicant can be counted on 
to act in preference to the United States without concern for the interests of Iran. </P> 
 
<P>As explained by the ASD(C<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN>I) in the August 16, 2000, memorandum, possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to 
whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount as a foreign passport could facilitate travel unverifiable by the United States. Applicant told 
the DSS in March 2002 that for reasons of convenience he did not wish to invalidate his Iranian passport. That statement raises a legitimate question as to 
whether Applicant has a preference for Iran over the United States.   Even after  Applicant was informed that his possession and use of a foreign passport was 
potentially security disqualifying, he failed to act  to surrender his Iranian passport to comply with the ASD(C<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN>I) mandate.  Thus, security concerns related to 
potentially undetected travel persist.   Thus, Applicant failed to demonstrate that his preference is exclusively for the United States as he did not comply with 
the DoD security guidance. </P> 
 
<P>Therefore, unfavorable findings are warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has mitigated the Government's security concerns over foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a foreign country as 
Applicant has a sibling, a mother, and a mother-in-law who are citizens of Iran.  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security 
risk may exist when an individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not 
citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These relationships could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security 
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may 
be disqualifying include:  (1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country.  </P> 
 
<P>On the other hand, contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Applicant has relatively infrequent contacts with his brother who remains in 
Iran. While he has closer ties to his mother, both his mother and mother-in-law are residents of the U.S.  None have any ties to the government of Iran.  Given 
these circumstances, it is improbable that any of his family members would create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information.  </P> 
 
<P>Although the Government asserts that Iran is part of the "axis of evil," the State Department Consular Information Sheet on Iran submitted does not clearly 
establish that concern.  While the State Department guidance does advise that foreign visitors may be placed under surveillance,  Applicant has stated that he 
believed he was never under surveillance.  These security concerns are mitigated as I conclude there is no substantial likelihood that these family ties would 
exercise foreign influence over Applicant. With only his brother remaining in Iran, any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate 
family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Merely because of these family ties Applicant is not vulnerable to duress.  </P> 
 
<P>Further, Applicant has had ties to the U.S. over a twenty-year period of time.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure, so do not invoke foreign influence concerns. Thus, I 
resolve SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. in Applicant's favor.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.Guideline C:     AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.:     Against Applicant</SPAN></P>

for the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER>Administrative Judge 
<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>  This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as 
amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.    
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>  Although Applicant stated to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in March 2002 that he "renounced" his Iranian citizenship when he took an oath of 
citizenship to the U.S., there is no evidence that he took any action with the Iranian government to formally renounce his citizenship; indeed he has maintained 
his Iranian citizenship as he retains his Iranian passport and also stated his intention to renew it when it expired in August 2004.  (Exhibit 5) 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>  The DoD August 16, 2000, Policy Clarification Memorandum (Exhibit 9) clarified the policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C and stated, in part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The 
Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to 
the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigation factor addresses 
the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this guideline are that possession and use of a 
foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate 
foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the 
applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United State Government.  Modification of 
the Guideline is not required. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>  DoD policy clarification of Guideline C issued in August 2000 made clear that "any clearance [must] be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders
