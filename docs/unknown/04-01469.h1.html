<P>Applicant has been involved with illegal drugs since 1983. He has not used drugs since August 2004, but stopped only after being notified the government had 
denied his request for clearance because of his drug use. It is highly probable he will resume his drug use in the future. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On August 24, 2004, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline H (illegal drugs). Applicant 
timely answered the SOR (Answer), admitted with explanation all of the allegations therein, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>On March 10, 2005, I convened a hearing at which the government presented six exhibits (GE 1 - GE 6) to support the SOR. In response, Applicant presented 
three exhibits (AE A), his own testimony and that of two other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on March 22, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions through his Answer are entered herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I also find the 
following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 37 years old and works as a software engineer for a defense contractor that hired him in 1999. Applicant first went to work in the defense industry 
in 1986 while attending college to earn a degree in computer science, which he received in 1991. Applicant is well regarded by his current employer as 
eminently qualified for his position, easy to work with, a great team player, and very trustworthy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began using marijuana in 1983 at about age 16. He used the drug with varying frequency until his freshman year in college in 1986, stopping because 
he was applying for student cooperative jobs with defense contractors that employed drug screening tests. Once clear of the drug tests, Applicant resumed his 
use of marijuana until about 1990, when he was nearing graduation. He again stopped using because he knew he would be subjected to drug testing as he 
applied for other jobs in the defense industry. Applicant resumed using marijuana on a regular basis, often weekly, in 1993.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning his senior of college, Applicant also began using other illegal drugs. He used LSD  once in 1990, which he has described as a bad experience. 
Undeterred, he resumed using LSD about once each year from 1993 to 1997. Applicant also used ecstacy two or three times in 1997, and again in 2002 despite 
the fact his last experience with the drug in 1997 made him ill. Applicant has purchased ecstacy for his use and for his friends to use as well. (SOR &para;&para;1.a, 1.b, 
and 1.e)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since he started using marijuana as a teenager, Applicant has purchased small amounts of the drug for personal use and to share with friends. He last used 
marijuana sometime in late 2004 and is willing to continue his abstinence from and purchase of illegal drugs while he holds a security clearance, but will 
continue to buy and use marijuana in the future if he does not hold a clearance. (SOR &para;&para;1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was investigated for a clearance in 1992. In August 1992, he gave a written statement about his drug use to a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent, 
and asserted he had no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. In his most recent statement to DSS in December 2002, Applicant expressed his intent to 
continue using marijuana and possible ecstacy in the future. Applicant has always been aware that it is illegal to use and possess marijuana, ecstacy, and LSD. 
His wife uses marijuana and has also used ecstacy with Applicant, and they continue to associate with other persons who use marijuana.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here is Guideline H (illegal drugs).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or 
dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Such conduct may also 
be criminal and indicative of a disregard for rules and regulations used to protect national interests.<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In this instance, the government has produced sufficient 
information through its exhibits and Applicant's admissions to support the preliminary decision as expressed in the SOR that Applicant should be denied a 
security clearance. Available information shows Applicant has used illegal drugs for much of his adult life. Indeed, he has purchased and used marijuana since 
his mid-teens, and expanded his involvement to include LSD and ecstacy as he was finishing college. Guideline H disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, none of the listed mitigating conditions apply here. Applicant's drug use is recent in that it occurred within the past year. Also, Applicant's drug 
involvement is hardly an isolated or aberrational event insofar as he has used illegal drugs for more than 20 years. As for demonstrating an intent not to use in 
the future, Applicant has abstained in the past, but only long enough to complete job-related drug screening. He resumed using marijuana in 1993 despite telling  
DSS in August 1992 he had no intent to use drugs in the future. Applicant now avers he will abstain as long as might hold a security clearance. I conclude 
Applicant has every intention of using marijuana and possibly other illegal drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR also alleges that Applicant should be disqualified based on application of federal law. (SOR &para;1.i) Specifically, 10 U.S.C. 986(c)(2) prohibits granting 
or renewing a security clearance if Applicant "is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance..." The plain language of this statute means that a 
person who uses illegal drugs at or very near the time of the hearing may not under any circumstances be granted a clearance. Here it is uncontroverted that, as 
of the hearing date, Applicant had last used an illegal drug, to wit, marijuana, about seven months earlier. While he has indicated he may use drugs in the future, 
he was not using them as of the hearing. The cited statute does not address past or prospective drug use and, thus, does not apply. I find for Applicant as to this 
allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-01469.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> of Applicant's drug use over the past 20 years and the distinct probability he will continue to engage in such conduct 
sustains the government's concerns about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Applicant has failed to overcome the adverse information presented by the government.</SPAN></P>
