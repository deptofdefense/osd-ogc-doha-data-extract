<P>The Applicant's past history of alcohol abuse that included an arrest in 1989 for DWI, and an alcohol assessment in 1990-1991 with a poor prognosis has been 
mitigated.  No alcohol related incidents have occurred over the past thirteen years.  His deliberate attempt to falsify his security clearance application dated 
February 17, 1999, by failing to include his alcohol related arrest in 1989 has not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 27, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended ) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 5, 2003, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on May 23, 2003.  The Applicant was instructed to 
submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on June 2, 2003, and submitted a  response 
dated June 20, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on July 10, 2003. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 39 years old and married.  He is employed as a Branch Supervisor by a defense contractor and is seeking to retain a security clearance in 
connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons 
(SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and Guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Applicant admits that he consumed alcohol at times to the point of intoxication from 1982 until at least 1991.  In 1982, at the age of twenty-two, the 
Applicant joined the United States Air Force and began consuming alcohol.  By the age of twenty-two, he was drinking on a regular basis.  He usually 
consumed between one to three beers at a sitting, with a maximum of seven to eight beers, or one to three mixed drinks per sitting, with a maximum of six 
mixed drinks.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 5).  He would typically drink one to two times a week, on Fridays and Saturdays with friends.  He admits to 
experiencing one blackout as a result of his abusive drinking in 1990.  He has never considered himself to be an alcoholic.  Since 1993, he states that his 
consumption of alcohol has been moderate.  He now consumes one or two beers once every two months. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1989, the Applicant, was arrested on base and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.  For this offense he received an Article 15.  The Applicant explained 
that he was consuming alcohol with his friends at a club off base.  He had consumed about 4, 16 ounce mixed drinks of Coke and Jim Beam.  When he left the 
club, he felt fine.  When he arrived at the base gate, he was stopped for an identification check and alcohol was detected.  He was arrested by military police.  It 
was later determined that the Applicant's blood alcohol level was greater than .20%.  His base privileges were suspended for one year and he was referred to the 
social action program for an alcohol assessment.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sometime in 1990, it was reported to the Applicant's command that the Applicant was discovered passed out on the front steps, intoxicated outside of the base 
club.  The Applicant was evaluated by the Alcoholic Assessment Center and diagnosed with a condition called episodic/binge drinking, alcohol abuse.  The 
Applicant was ordered to attend an inpatient alcohol treatment program for approximately 30 days that included counseling, group meetings, films, lectures, one 
on one counseling and alcohol abstinence.  He also had to participate in a six month after-care program for alcohol abuse.  The Applicant indicates that he 
successfully completed the alcohol treatment and counseling.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's alcohol assessment by the military's Chief of the Alcoholism  Rehabilitation Center stated, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is doubtful if he has any identification with the disease of alcoholism or the seriousness of past symptoms.  He does not appreciate the full impact of his 
powerlessness over alcohol as evidenced by his belief that he can return to his lifestyle before treatment.  The patient lacks the commitment to work a program 
of sobriety which includes life changes over an extended period.  His prognosis at the time of discharge is poor.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 6, p.13, dated May 
31, 1990).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard Form 86) dated February 17, 1999.  Question 24, of the application asked 
the Applicant if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  The Applicant answered, "No".  This was a false 
answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose his arrest of 1989 for Driving While Intoxicated.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 4).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant indicated that he did not report his arrest for Driving While Intoxicated nor his alcohol treatment because he was embarrassed.  He was also 
afraid of being denied a security clearance and/or an unfavorable employment action.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 5).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant intentionally concealed his alcohol related arrest in 1989 from the government.  There is no other reasonable excuse for his inaccurate 
response.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant intentionally attempted to conceal material  information from the Government on his security clearance 
application. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1.  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . ;</P> 
 
<P>4.  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>2.  The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is not indication of a recent problem.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in a history of alcohol abuse and dishonesty, which demonstrate poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by evidence that the Applicant has engaged in alcohol abuse, (Guideline G), and that he 
intentionally falsified his security clearance application (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of 
the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there is some evidence in the record to show that the Applicant did not take his  problem with alcohol seriously, there is stronger evidence to suggests 
that the Applicant's history of alcohol abuse from 1989 until at least 1991 is now reformed and rehabilitated.  Thirteen years have passed since the Applicant's 
last alcohol related incident.  In 1990, he completed an alcohol treatment program, although not with a favorable prognosis, but has since then reduced his 
consumption of alcohol.  Although he admits that he continues to use alcohol, there is no evidence in the record to show that he continues to abuse it.  His last 
incident of abuse documented in this record occurred in 1990.  Given the significant period of time that has passed with no reoccurrences of alcohol abuse, I 
find that he has sufficiently rehabilitated himself in this area of concern. Accordingly, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) is found for the Applicant.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More troubling in this case, however, is the fact that the evidence shows that the Applicant deliberately attempted to conceal material information from the 
Government in his security clearance application.  The Applicant was embarrassed about his past arrest and did not want to divulge it.  The Government, 
however, relies heavily on the Applicant's responses to the questionnaire and requires that the responses be honest and truthful.  There is no reasonable excuse 
for the Applicant's failure to provide inaccurate information in his security clearance application. </SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The intentional concealment or omission of a material fact is 
an act of great security significance and cannot be tolerated.  Under the particular facts of this case, the Applicant cannot be trusted.  Accordingly, Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  </SPAN></P>
