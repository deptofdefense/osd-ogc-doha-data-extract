<P>In June 1998, while on active duty as an Army officer, Applicant was reprimanded for indecent conduct with two teenaged girls, obstruction of justice, and 
inappropriately touching an enlisted subordinate.  In August 1999, he was reprimanded for assaulting his fiance&eacute; during an argument.  In October 1999, he was 
arrested for driving under the influence, ordered by his commander to attend an alcohol abuse program, and left the program without completing it.  In March 
2000, he was reprimanded for making inappropriate personal comments to a junior enlisted soldier.  Security concerns based on personal conduct and sexual 
behavior are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 17, 2004, admitted the allegations in part and denied them in part, offered explanations, and requested a 
hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on June 27, 2005, and scheduled for hearing on September 15, 2005.  Applicant did not appear on the scheduled date.  
On inquiry, I determined Applicant had not received the Notice of Hearing until the day on which the hearing was scheduled.  Accordingly, I rescheduled the 
hearing for October 20, 2005, and it was conducted on that date.  At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend SOR &para; 1.f. to conform to the 
evidence.  Department Counsel's motion to amend initially requested adding an additional allegation under Guideline E, but she withdrew that request at the 
hearing.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  DOHA received the transcript on November 3, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old senior program analyst for a defense contractor.  He served on active duty in the Army from May 1980 to May 2000, retiring as a 
major.  Shortly after retiring, he began working for his current employer, from whom he has received outstanding performance appraisals.  Applicant is a 
project manager for his employer, supervising a 19-person team, of which two-thirds are women, and half the women are in their early 20s.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All the incidents underlying the SOR occurred while Applicant was on active duty as an Army officer.  He received a written reprimand in June 1998 for 
indecent acts and liberties with a child under the age of 16, indecent assault on a child, indecent assault, and obstruction of justice.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The charges of indecent 
assault on a child and taking indecent liberties with a child were based on two accusations.  The first was based on an accusation that Applicant had bumped a 
15-year-old girl several times and unexpectedly hugged her in August 1997.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The second was an accusation that Applicant had touched the inner thigh of a 13-year-old girl and told her she was sexy, after the girl accepted his offer of a ride home during a rainstorm in January 1998.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Both girls were children of 
Applicant's neighbors, and Applicant had previously approached them about babysitting his two children.  The charge of obstruction of justice was based on 
evidence that in February 1998 Applicant told an enlisted soldier under his command to tell investigators she did not know anything about his personal 
conduct.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The charge of indecent assault was based on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an accusation by an enlisted soldier under Applicant's command that he patted her buttocks and rubbed 
his body against her while walking past her.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an interview with a criminal investigator, Applicant denied touching the 13-year-old girl or telling her she looked sexy.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted he might have touched the 13-year-old inadvertently.  At the hearing he admitted telling her she was attractive.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted to the 15-year-old 
girl's father that he had hugged her at the conclusion of a conversation about babysitting, and he apologized.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied obstructing justice.  He testified at the hearing that a soldier had complained to him about aggressive questioning by the criminal investigators, 
and he advised the soldier she was not required to tolerate their badgering.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted in part the allegation of inappropriately touching a female subordinate.  He admitted he interacted with his soldiers physically and it would 
not have been unusual for him to slap a young female soldier on the buttocks.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, he responded to all the above allegations by admitting he "allowed [himself] to be placed in an environment or circumstances where 
inappropriate behavior could be perceived, comments or actions manipulated, or misconstrued regardless of intent."  At the hearing, Applicant portrayed the 
above incidents as minor, not meriting criminal prosecution, and the product of working in a "zero defect" environment.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The accusations by the teenaged girls triggered a wide-ranging criminal investigation that included interviews of numerous schoolgirls, a search of Applicant's 
home for child pornography, and seizure of his personal computer.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Applicant complained frequently about the excessive zealousness of the investigators, and 
he referred to the investigation as a "witch hunt" at the hearing and in his answer to the SOR. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1999, Applicant received an oral reprimand for assaulting his fianc&eacute;e during an argument.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted discussing the incident with his 
commander but denied being reprimanded.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1999, Applicant was arrested by civilian police for driving while intoxicated.  A police officer approached Applicant's parked vehicle, saw 
Applicant in the driver's seat, and smelled alcohol.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted he had been drinking, and the police found an open container of an alcoholic beverage 
in his vehicle.  Applicant declined to take a breathalyzer test.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  After the incident, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol and drug abuse prevention program, 
anticipating a "command referral," which followed shortly thereafter.  After the charges were dismissed, in part because Applicant was not observed actually 
driving,<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Applicant stopped participating in the program, because in his view the grounds for the command referral were negated, and there was no longer any 
reason to continue with the program.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2000, Applicant received a written reprimand for making inappropriate suggestions to a junior enlisted soldier<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> implying a desire to have a personal 
relationship with her.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied having any recollection of these events and stated he did not recall receiving a written 
reprimand.  At the hearing, Applicant stated he had no memory of any contact with the soldier.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise under this 
guideline when there is "[r]eliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances."  Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.2.1.  The numerous sworn statements supporting the allegations in the SOR establish DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 4) may arise from "[p]ersonal conduct . . . that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."  
Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.  The evidence of Applicant's inappropriate behavior with the teenaged girls and his military subordinates establishes DC 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, a disqualifying condition (DC 5) may arise from "[a] pattern of . . . rule violations."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.  Applicant's military disciplinary record, 
obstruction of justice, violations of military standards in his relationships with female subordinates, and his unilateral decision to terminate participation in a 
command-directed alcohol abuse program establish DC 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's reprimands alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.f. were imposed for the obstruction of justice alleged in SOR &para;1.g. and the sexual behavior alleged in SOR 
&para;&para; 2.a. through 2.d., discussed below.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant's 
favor. <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.f. in Applicant's favor.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 5) applies to the security concern based on personal conduct when there is evidence of  "positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.5.  While the administrative correspondence in this case informed 
Applicant's employer that his security clearance is under review, there is nothing in the record showing Applicant or anyone else informed his employer about 
the specific facts alleged in the SOR.  Thus, he remains vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  I conclude MC 5 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also evaluated Applicant's conduct under the general adjudicative guidelines in the Directive.  In considering the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
Applicant's conduct (Directive &para; E2.2.1.1), I conclude Applicant's inappropriate conduct with two teenaged girls and his female military subordinates was 
serious.  The conduct occurred when Applicant was a mature adult and a military officer nearing the end of a 20-year career.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.4. (age and 
maturity).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the frequency and recency of Applicant's conduct, I conclude there were several instances of inappropriate conduct with young women, and the 
most recent incident was in early 2000.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.3.  The concept of recency is closely related to rehabilitation (Directive &para; E2.2.1.6.) and likelihood of 
recurrence (Directive &para; E2.2.1.9).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  The sufficiency or insufficiency of 
an applicant's period of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to 
demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather on a reasoned analysis of all the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case.  If the record evidence shows a 
significant period of time has passed without evidence of misconduct by an applicant, then an administrative judge must articulate a rational basis for 
concluding why that period of time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  ISCR 
Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Applicant's conduct with young women was "recent" within the meaning of the  Directive, and I am not satisfied he is rehabilitated or similar 
misconduct will not recur.  While his last reprimand was in March 2003 and he has not been accused of inappropriate conduct by female subordinates in his 
current job, he has worked under the pressure of keeping his security clearance since September 2000, when he filed his security clearance application, and even 
closer scrutiny since the SOR was issued in December 2003.  Under these circumstances, the absence of further complaints is certainly relevant but not 
dispositive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never admitted his misconduct with the teenaged girls and military subordinates.  When his conduct was investigated by military authorities, he 
asserted he was misunderstood and victimized by a witch hunt.  At the hearing, he was embarrassed but not contrite.  He has admitted the altercation with his 
then-fianc&eacute;e and his arrest for driving under the influence, but he has sought to minimize his culpability on the ground that the incidents occurred shortly after 
he underwent a bitter divorce and custody battle.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find Applicant's claimed lack of memory of the circumstances of his March 2000 reprimand implausible.  His claimed inability to remember an embarrassing 
disciplinary action shortly before his retirement causes me to doubt his veracity.  Based on Applicant's lack of remorse, continued efforts to minimize and 
justify his conduct, and implausible claims of lack of memory, I conclude insufficient time has elapsed to establish his rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's arrest in October 1999 is the only incident of alcohol-related misconduct.  However, Applicant disregarded the directive of his commander to 
undergo alcohol abuse training, and he took it upon himself to determine the command was no longer binding after the criminal charges were dismissed.  His 
disobedience of his commander's order to attend and complete the alcohol abuse program, however, was only one of several incidents reflecting disregard for 
authority.  At the hearing, Applicant maintained his decision to withdraw from the program was justified.  As with his other misconduct, he minimized his 
culpability, attempted to justify his behavior, and showed no contrition.  There is no evidence his ability to carry out distasteful orders has been tested in his 
current job.  I am not satisfied he will not unilaterally decide in the future to disregard a rule or directive with which he disagrees.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.<A HREF="02-15474.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns based on personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D: Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  DC 1 under this guideline applies if there is "[s]exual behavior of a 
criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.1.  Applicant's conduct with the 13-year-old girl (SOR &para; 2.a.) was 
criminal, in that touching her thigh was an indecent assault.  Applicant's conduct with the 15-year-old girl (SOR &para; 2.c.) was inappropriate, but I have resolved 
this allegation in Applicant's favor because it does not appear to have been sexual.  Slapping a female subordinate on the buttocks (SOR &para; 2.b.) may not have 
been sexual; however, the inappropriate rubbing against her was sexual.  Applicant's overtures to a subordinate female soldier (SOR &para; 2.d.) appear to have been 
sexual.  Applicant's conduct with female subordinates violated Articles 133 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 933 and 934.  <EM>See</EM> Manual 
for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.), Part IV, &para;&para; 59 (conduct unbecoming an officer) and 83 (fraternization).  I conclude DC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2 applies when there is "[c]ompulsive or addictive sexual behavior . . . or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.2.  
There is no evidence of pedophilia or any sexually-related mental or personality disorder.  I conclude DC 2 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3 applies when there is "[s]exual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.3.  
Applicant's conduct with the teenaged girls and military subordinates establishes DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4 applies when there is sexual behavior reflecting lack of discretion or judgment.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.4.  Applicant's behavior with the teenaged girls and 
his female subordinates establishes DC 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant.  MC 2 applies if "[t]he behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar 
nature."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.3.2.  For the reasons discussed under the personal conduct guideline, above, I conclude MC 2 is not established, because 
Applicant's behavior was "recent" within the meaning of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 applies if "[t]here is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability."  MC 3 is not established because Applicant's 
altercations with his fianc&eacute;e, apprehension for driving under the influence, and unauthorized withdrawal from the alcohol abuse program demonstrate 
questionable judgment and irresponsibility. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 4 applies when "[t]he behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress."  This mitigating condition is not established because there 
is no evidence showing Applicant's record of misconduct has been disclosed to his current employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same general adjudicative guidelines discussed under the personal conduct guideline, above, also apply to sexual behavior.  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns based on sexual behavior. </SPAN></P>
