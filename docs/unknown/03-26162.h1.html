<P>Applicant committed criminal conduct on at least eight separate occasions, including spousal abuse, domestic battery, domestic violence, failure to appear for a

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On January 26, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated February</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 21, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 4, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated May 3, 2005, a hearing 
was held on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 17, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered twelve documentary exhibits (Government's Exhibits 1-12) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his 
attorney, offered four documentary exhibits (Applicant's Exhibits A-D) and offered his own testimony and the testimony of his daughter.  The transcript (Tr) 
was received on August 25, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains eight allegations, 1.a. through 1.h., under 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 42 years old and is currently married. He is employed as a field service engineer by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. Applicant's conduct that occurred in 1986 through 
2001, and which has been alleged  in the SOR as 1.a. through 1.h., is included  in this paragraph as criminal conduct.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations will be discussed as they were alleged in the SOR: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. On June 4, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with Felonious Assault with a deadly weapon. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that the incident which caused this 
event did involve a fist fight, </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">but he argued that no weapon was involved. Applicant admits that this allegation is true in his Response to the SOR (RSOR).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. On June 17, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with Inflicting Corporal Injury on Spouse. He was sentenced to 36 months probation. In his RSOR, 
he partially admits and partially denies this allegation. Applicant testified that he had a fight with his brother-in-law, but initially  denied his wife was involved. 
Upon additional questioning, he did concede that his wife may have been injured by him when she was trying to break up the fight (Tr at 51-52).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> failed to appear for a Bench Warrant Hearing that was set for June 30, 1994, and a Bench Warrant was issued in the amount of $15,000. 
Applicant denies that this allegation is true in his RSOR and during his testimony. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He initially claimed that he never lived in the city from where a ticket, which became the subject of the bench warrant, was issued, and therefore he could not 
have received the ticket. His explanation during his testimony continued to change. He first averred that only his mother-in-law lived in this city. Then he 
admitted that his wife also lived within the city. Thereafter, he testified that he spent a great deal of time at that address in the city, but he did not live there 
permanently. Finally, his SCA indicates that he did live there during this period. (Tr at 54-60).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant contended that he was not aware of this Bench Warrant Hearing until he was involved in the security clearance process. However, in 
Exhibit 11, a signed, sworn statement made by Applicant to a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) he admitted that he first became aware of the 
warrant in 2002 by a clerk of the court where he was going to pay for a traffic ticket. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. On May 4, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with Domestic Battery. He admits in his RSOR that he was arrested and charged with Domestic 
Battery.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. On August 25, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with Spousal Abuse. He  admits that  that he was arrested and charged with Spousal Abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his testimony, Applicant testified that these 2 incidents in 1995 did not involve his wife, but rather were as a result of fights with his brother-in-law. He 
could give no explanation for why both of these arrests involved charges of abuse against his wife and never mentioned his brother-in-law (Tr at 52-53). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 21, 2001</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, an incident report was filed against </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> charging him with Domestic Violence and Vandalism. In his RSOR, he partially 
admits and partially denies this allegation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 23, 2001</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, an incident report was filed against </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> charging him with Vandalism. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his testimony </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> admitted to 
allegation 1.g., in the SOR (Tr at 71-72).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 29, 2001</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant was arrested and charged with 1) Battery against a Former Spouse, and 2) Vandalism. He pled Nolo Contendere to 
Count 1 and was sentenced to 36 months probation, to pay a fine of $337, and restitution of $300. He was sentenced to serve 10 days in jail, and he was also 
ordered to attend one year of weekly sessions (52) of a domestic violence counseling program. Applicant testified that he did not serve any time as a result of 
this arrest, but that the rest of this allegation is correct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibits 3, 4, and 6 are the incident reports involving these three events that occurred in 2001. Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">'s</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of these event were significantly different 
from the incident reports. He could give no reasonable explanation for why his version of the facts differed form those on the incidents reports. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government has established by substantial evidence that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's conduct, which occurred </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">from 1986 until 2001</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and which is the basis for allegations 
1.a. through 1.h. of the SOR,  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is criminal.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Conditions a, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged; and b, A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">apply because Applicant's conduct did involve eight serious criminal offenses over a period 
of at least 15 years. Applicant failed to offer any significant evidence to rebut the Government's case regarding his criminal conduct. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the hearing, 
Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> gave</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> inconsistent and sometimes contradictory explanations of how  these events occurred. I find that his entire testimony was less than credible.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While an argument may be made that the criminal behavior was not recent, I find that based on the history and seriousness of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s conduct, it is too soon 
to make that finding, and therefore, no Mitigating Conditions apply. I resolve Guideline J against the Applicant. </SPAN></P>
