<P>The Applicant used marijuana, on an occasional basis, over a period of seven years, ending in January of 2002.  He also purchased the drug on three occasions, 
spending as much as $100 during one purchase.  The Applicant drug involvement is too recent, so as not to be of current security clearance significance.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 30, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 13, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on September 18, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on October 2, 2002, and Applicant's reply was received on or about October 16, 2002.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on November 7, 2002.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted drug involvement militates against 
the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 42 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about January of 1995 until his last usage on January 1, 2002 (Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at 
page 9, and GX 5 at page 2).  In a sworn statement executed by the Applicant on February 12, 2002, he avers, in part, the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over the past seven years, I have used marijuana on an "average" of one time every three to six months.  During the past seven years, there have probably been 
periods when I haven't used in(<EM>sic</EM>) for a year or so, and other times when I've used it once a week for a period of weeks (GX 5 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  As to his purchasing marijuana, the Applicant admits the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On three occasions over the past seven years, I have purchased marijuana.  The biggest single purchase was $100, which represented a quarter of an ounce, 
which can be broken down roughly to eight to 20 rolled marijuana cigarettes.  I made this purchase sometime in 1999.  The other two purchases were made 
prior to 1999, and were less than $100 (GX 5 at pages 2~3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  As to the Applicant's future intentions as to the use of marijuana, in his February 12, 2002, sworn statement, he candidly swore, "I intend to continue to 
use marijuana as I have over the past seven years: approximately once every three to six months" (GX 5 at page 3).  However, in both his answer to the SOR 
and in his response to the Government's FORM, the Applicant now disavowals his prior sworn stated intention (GX 2 and Response).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation, except that he now disavowals any future drug abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction);<A HREF="02-16932.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">none</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the 
same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's occasional drug involvement extends over a period of about 7 years, from 1995 until January of this year.  He not only used Marijuana, but the 
Applicant also purchased the illegal substance on at least three occasions, spending as much as $100 for the drug on one occasion. Although the Applicant now 
disavowals any future drug abuse, it is too soon to say that his past abuse is not of present security significance.  Guideline H is therefore found against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline H, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
