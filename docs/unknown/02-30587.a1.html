  When reviewing an Administrative Judge's decision, the Board does not review individual sentences or phrases in isolation from the rest of the decision.  When a party  challenges the Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines, the Board has to decide  whether the party has shown the Judge reached conclusions not supported by substantial record  evidence, acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious, or acted contrary to law.  The  appealing party must do more than simply disagree with a Judge's weighing of the record  evidence.  The appealing party must show how the Judge weighed the record evidence in a  manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  It was not arbitrary or capricious for the  Judge to conclude Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised by his contacts  with  a woman who is a Russian citizen living in that country and with his brother who is an Iranian  citizen living in that country.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), dated January 23, 2004, which stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or 
revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).  Administrative Judge Michael J. Breslin issued 
an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated November 24, 2004.</P> 
<P>	Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has 
jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>	The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge 
committed harmful error by referring to Applicant's Russian girlfriend as his "former fiancee" in the 
conclusions section of his decision; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding  
that the presence of Applicant's brother in Iran and Applicant's former girlfriend in Russia raised 
unmitigated security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  For the reasons that follow, 
the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>	On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the 
material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no 
presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and 
identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>	When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must 
consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are 
arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not 
examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, 
including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider 
relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the 
case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's 
rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to 
provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance 
with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the 
Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 
(Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decisions).</P> 
<P>	When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine 
whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as 
a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the 
credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a 
Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable 
interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not 
immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden 
on appeal.</P> 
<P>	When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> 
DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
<P>	If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the 
following questions:</P> 
<P>	Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 
(discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>	Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's 
decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 
17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>	If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or 
remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>	1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge committed harmful error by referring to Applicant's 
Russian girlfriend as his "former fiancee" in the conclusions section of his decision</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge made the following findings of fact with reference to a Russian woman 
Applicant met on a business trip to Russia in 1998: (a) Applicant developed a romantic relationship 
with the woman which lasted from 1999 to 2002; (b) the woman stayed with Applicant in his home 
in the United States for about nine months in 1999 and then returned to Russia; (c) after her return 
to Russia, Applicant kept in frequent contact with her through e-mail and met her in Europe or 
Russia during business trips; (d) at the time Applicant submitted his security clearance application, 
he was considering marrying the woman; (e) the relationship was terminated amicably during 
Applicant's visit to Moscow during Christmas, 2002; and (f) Applicant still maintains contact with 
the woman by telephone and e-mail.  At one point in the conclusions section of his decision, the 
Judge refers to the woman as Applicant's "former fiancee."  On appeal, Applicant argues that the 
Judge's conclusion that the woman was Applicant's fiancee (and by inference that the couple was 
engaged) was incorrect, pointing out that the relationship never matured to the status of engagement.  
Although he does not precisely articulate the point, Applicant is, in essence, arguing that, for the 
purposes of evaluating the significance of the relationship under Guideline B, the Judge's 
characterization of his girlfriend as his fiancee implies a closer relationship than the one actually 
established by the record evidence.</P> 
<P>	Applicant is correct that the Administrative Judge's characterization of his girlfriend as his  
fiancee was error, given the facts of this case.  The Board concludes, however, that the error was 
harmless.  The Judge's decision contains only one reference to the Applicant's girlfriend as his 
"former fiancee."  When reviewing an Administrative Judge's decision, the Board does not consider 
individual sentences (or phrases) in isolation from the rest of the decision; rather, the Board 
considers the decision in its entirety to discern what the Judge found and concluded. <EM> See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
case No. 01-22311 (April 4, 2003) at p. 4.  Viewed in the context of the Judge's decision as a whole, 
the one instance where the Judge refers to Applicant's girlfriend as his "former fiancee" is an 
aberration that is inconsistent with the remainder of the Judge's decision.  The Board notes that there 
are multiple references to the Russian woman as Applicant's "girlfriend" or "female friend" in both 
the findings and conclusions portions of the Judge's decision.  A reading of the Judge's decision in 
its entirety indicates that the Judge neither explicitly nor impliedly concluded that Applicant was 
engaged to his Russian friend.  The Board is also convinced, after a reading of the Judge's decision, 
that his overall characterization of the relationship between Applicant and his Russian girlfriend is 
supported by the record evidence.</P> 
<P>	2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the presence of Applicant's 
brother in Iran and Applicant's former girlfriend in Russia raised unmitigated security concerns 
under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  Regarding Guideline B, the Administrative Judge concluded 
that the status of Applicant's brother as a citizen and resident of Iran and the status of his former 
girlfriend (with whom he still maintained contact) as a citizen and resident of Russia gave rise to 
security concerns that had not been mitigated.  On appeal, Applicant makes several contentions in 
support of his main argument that the evidence he presented established the applicability of 
Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3.<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He states: (a) his 
brother is not in a position that could present the possibility of the Iranian government coercing him 
to obtain information about an individual as insignificant as Applicant, who left Iran in 1987 without 
records; (b) although a member of an ethnic minority which has historically faced oppression in Iran, 
Applicant's brother, because of his current position as a successful businessman, is past the point 
where he could be influenced by oppression from the Iranian government; (c) his current contacts 
with his former girlfriend are not of a romantic nature and are very casual with declining frequency; 
and (d) he has lived half his life in the U.S. and through his conduct during that time, he has proven 
his loyalty to this country.  Applicant's argument fails to establish error on the part of the Judge.  </P> 
<P>	Once the Administrative Judge concluded that Department Counsel had presented evidence 
sufficient to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case under Guideline B, the burden shifted to Applicant to 
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances sufficient to 
warrant a favorable security clearance decision.<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  There is no right to a security clearance,<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> there is 
no presumption in favor of granting a security clearance,<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> a security clearance should not be granted 
unless there is an affirmative determination that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for a particular applicant<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and doubts must be resolved in favor  
of the national security.<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Accordingly, once facts raising security concerns under Guideline B were 
admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel, Applicant had a heavy burden of 
persuasion.</P> 
<P>	When a party challenges an Administrative Judge's application of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, the Board has to decide whether the party has shown the Judge: (i) reached conclusions 
not supported by substantial record evidence; (ii) acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious; 
or (iii) acted contrary to law.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-15339 (April 29, 2004) at p. 4.</P> 
<P>	Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Administrative 
Judge to conclude the record evidence did not warrant application of Guideline B Mitigating 
Conditions 1 and 3.</P> 
<P>	Applicant's disagreement with the Administrative Judge's weighing of the record evidence 
does not demonstrate the Judge erred.  There is no simple formula or rule of law on how a Judge 
must weigh record evidence.  Subject to review for action that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law, the Judge has discretion to weigh the record evidence.  A Judge is not always faced with a 
case where the record evidence points all in one direction.  To the contrary, it is not unusual for a 
Judge to be faced with conflicting record evidence, or with a record that contains some evidence that 
favors one side and different evidence that favors the other side.  In such situations, the Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole, decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the 
unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa, </EM>and reach a conclusion as to whether the applicant has met his 
or her burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.<A HREF="02-30587.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  If an 
appealing party challenges the Judge's weighing of the record evidence, that party must not simply 
disagree with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence.  They must articulate a cogent reason or 
argument for how the Judge erred in weighing the record evidence.  Similarly, if an appealing party 
challenges a Judge's conclusions, that party must not simply disagree with the Judge's conclusions, 
but must articulate a cogent reason or argument for how the Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.  </P> 
<P>	Applicant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that the Administrative Judge's 
conclusions that Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3 did not apply to the case were arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
