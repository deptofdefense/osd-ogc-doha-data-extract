<P>Applicant is an administrative assistant for a defense contractor.  She was arrested five times in nine years for minor offenses.  Three of the cases were either 
not prosecuted or resulted in acquittal.  Applicant had significant delinquent debt on her initial credit report.  She contested some of the delinquent debts as 
erroneous entries and most were removed from her latest credit report.  Two are still being contested.  Applicant also paid off the delinquent debts she did not 
contest.  Applicant has mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations and criminal conduct.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 5, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>(Feb 20, 1990), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 11, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 4, 2004.  She admitted all of the allegations under Guideline J and admitted one and denied the rest of the 
allegations under Guideline F.  She requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The request for a hearing was received by DOHA on June 14, 2004.  
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on November 3, 2004, and the case was assigned to me on November 10, 2004.  A notice of hearing 
was issued on December 6, 2004, and the hearing was held on January 5, 2005.  Six government exhibits, four Applicant exhibits and the testimony of the 
Applicant were received during the hearing.  The transcript was received on January 12, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is 34 years old and has worked for three years as an administrative assistant for a defense contractor.  She is the mother of two teenagers who live

abuse cases.  Upon completion of her probation in 2004, the finding of guilty was removed from her record.  She pled guilty because she was informed by court 
personnel the judge would not extend her case, and if she pled guilty she would only pay a small fine and ordered to attend alcohol abuse classes.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debts 2.h and 2.k of the SOR are bills for electric service in an apartment Applicant rented under a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

The debts are not listed on her latest credit report.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 2.i of the SOR is for an overdrawn checking account.  Applicant's pay was electronically credited to her account by her employer.  Unfortunately, her 
employer had financial problems and some electronic transfers were not honored by Applicant's bank.  Applicant wrote checks on the account not knowing the 
pay was not credited.  Applicant paid the account when advised of the debt and it was removed from her latest credit report.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

Applicant explained that her wages were never garnished.  She took out a loan and part of the process was to sign a letter permitting the lender to garnish her 
wages if payments were not paid.  This letter is the documentary information introduced by Department Counsel.  Applicant has made all payments and the 
wages have not been garnished.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), a security concern exists for a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about a person's judgment, reliability 
and trustworthiness.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  Applicant's arrests and convictions for various offenses brings the matter under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions; Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>a single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).  </EM>Applicant was arrested five times in nine years for various minor offenses.  The five arrests meet the criteria of 
criminal conduct even if Applicant was not convicted of all of the offenses. She was convicted of two offenses, one was a finding of guilty but applicant was 
placed on probation before judgement, and two were not prosecuted.  There was no evidence to indicate Applicant was guilty of criminal conduct for the 
offenses that were not prosecuted.  None of the offenses were serious but they are multiple lesser offenses.  I conclude the Criminal Conduct disqualifying 
conditions have been established.</P> 
<P>The Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions to consider for Applicant are: Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>); Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>); Directive E2.A10.1.3.5 (<EM>acquittal</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6 <EM>(there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation</EM>).  Three of Applicant's arrests took place in the 1990s.  The other two were in the early 2000s, and the latest was over two and a half years ago.  
The criminal offenses are not recent.  Even though there are five arrests for criminal conduct, each was for a different minor offense so they are isolated 
incidents.  Three of the arrests resulted in an acquittal or were not prosecuted.  Applicant was either fined or placed on probation for two minor offenses for 
which guilty findings were assessed.  All the arrests were for minor offenses and there have been no arrests in almost three years.  Applicant has been working 
successfully and raising her children and there are clear signs of successful rehabilitation.  Applicant's history or pattern of criminal activity does not create 
doubt about her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the disqualifying conditions for Criminal Conduct.</P> 
<P> Under Guideline F (Financial Conditions) a security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financial 
irresponsibility may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly 
in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.<A HREF="03-08980.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  Applicant's delinquent debts brings the matter within 
Financial Consideration Disqualifying Condition Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   Applicant's initial credit report 
revealed she had 12 delinquent debts.  Applicant admitted eight of the debts were valid.  She contested two, and denied two were valid.  Applicant's admissions 
and the credit report are sufficient to establish the Financial Consideration disqualifying condition.  I conclude the disqualifying condition has been established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions that should be considered for Applicant's financial situation are: Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the behavior was 
not recent</EM>); Directive E2.A6.1.3.4  (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control</EM>); and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts</EM>).  Applicant took efforts to clear up her financial status after learning of the content of her credit report.  She contested some debts on the report and paid 
off the delinquent debts she did not contest.  The only delinquent debts still outstanding on Applicant's latest credit report are debts 2.a and 2.b of the SOR for 
the credit card used by another person.  Applicant inquired about these charges and is working with the credit card company to determine her liability for the 
accounts.  While the issue has not been resolved, Applicant is making efforts to resolve the debts.  These debts were incurred over five years ago and her 
behavior of incurring delinquent debts is not recent.  When Applicant learned of the extent of her debt in the credit reports, she sought financial counseling and 
followed the guidance.  Applicant made a good-faith effort and her delinquent debts are now resolved.  I conclude Applicant has met her burden to mitigate the 
Financial Considerations disqualifying condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept to determine a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  I conclude 
Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
