<P>Applicant mitigated the security concerns about his alcohol abuse. However, he failed to mitigate the security concerns about his personal and criminal conduct 
stemming from his deliberate and multiple falsifications of answers to questions in his most recent security clearance application (SF 86). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On January 31, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline 
G (alcohol consumption), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely submitted a responsive pleading, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 24, 2005, and I convened a hearing on September 20, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9), which were admitted without objection. Applicant proffered no documents but testified in his own behalf, and 
presented the testimony of five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on October 6, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 34 years old and employed by a defense contractor as local area network (LAN) technician. He has worked for his current employer since 
September 2000. When he was 18 years old, Applicant enlisted in the United States Navy. In September 2000, he was discharged as an operations specialist 
third class (OS3; paygrade E-4); however, he had previously attained the rank of OS2 and was in line for promotion to OS1 before being twice reduced in rank 
for alcohol-related disciplinary reasons.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was convicted in 1992 of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). After going to nightclubs, he pulled over to the side of the road and went to 
sleep. Police discovered him and administered a blood alcohol test that showed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .14%. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1994, Applicant was convicted of DUI, second offense. He was home on leave and was stopped for speeding. His BAC was .10%, the result of drinking 
five or six beers earlier that day. He also had an open container of beer in the car when he was stopped. He was convicted in absentia and fined.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1996, Applicant appeared at Captain's Mast and received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for 
being drunk and disorderly, and for communicating a threat. He was reduced in rank from OS2 to OS3. In September 1996, Applicant again appeared at 
Captain's Mast and was found guilty of being drunk on duty. He was further reduced in rank from OS3 to OSSN (paygrade E-3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After his May 1996 Article 15 punishment, Applicant was checked into a Navy inpatient alcohol treatment program. In February 1997, he was diagnosed by a 
Navy drug and alcohol counselor as alcohol dependent. In March 1998, Applicant successfully completed his treatment program and aftercare plan, and was 
released from the Navy's drug and alcohol abuse program. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1997, Applicant was a passenger in a vehicle involved in an accident. The driver was intoxicated and had fallen asleep. Applicant moved him out of the 
driver's seat to check on him. When the police arrived they determined that Applicant had been at the wheel when the accident happened and charged him with 
reckless driving. Applicant admits he had consumed alcohol before the accident but that he was not intoxicated. He was ultimately found guilty of obstructing 
justice and fined. In May 1998, Applicant was charged with domestic assault and battery. He and his girlfriend had argued and she called the police to get him 
to leave their home. He had not been drinking before the argument. His girlfriend later dropped the charges.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in May 2000 and charged with DUI. He had three or four beers before he was stopped for speeding. His BAC was .14%. He was 
convicted of DUI, fined, placed on 18 months probation, and ordered to complete alcohol counseling. Applicant successfully completed the terms of his 
sentence and has abstained from alcohol since this arrest. The court-ordered counseling took almost one year to complete because Applicant had to switch 
programs in order to comply with the court's requirements. The counselor center he initially used could not reliably see him on a weekly basis as required by 
the court.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of Applicant's last arrest in May 2000, he was away from his ship without authorization. When he returned to the ship, he appeared at Captain's 
ast and was found guilty of unauthorized absence and driving while intoxicated. He had regained his earlier rank of IT2 by this time, but was reduced in rank 
to IT3 as part of his punishment. He left the Navy four months later with an honorable discharge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has held a clearance since he joined the Navy in 1990. In January 2001, he submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) to begin a periodic re-investigation of his suitability for clearance. In response to question 24, which asked if he had "ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to 
alcohol...,"Applicant answered "no." In response to question 25, which asked if Applicant, "in the last 7 years, [had] been subject to court martial or other 
disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (include non-judicial, Captain's Mast, etc.)," he answered "no." In response to question 26, 
which asked if Applicant, in "the last 7 years, [had] been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)" not addressed by other questions about 
criminal conduct, he answered "no." In response to question 30, which asked if, in "the last 7 years, [Applicant's] use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, 
beer, wine) [had] resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism), he answered "no."<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has completed similar security questionnaires before and was already familiar with the questions when he completed his 2001 SF 86.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He told a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in December 2001 that he had disclosed his then-existing arrests in a 1996 security questionnaire while in the Navy, but 
that he answered the aforementioned questions as he had in 2001 because he "considered that it would adversely affect [his] clearance and [his] job."<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his co-workers and friends as dedicated, reliable, and talented. He has made several trips on temporary duty orders (TDY) in 
support of the contract to which he is assigned. These TDYs have been made without incident and there are no known problems with how he handles classified 
information. Applicant and his wife have known each other for ten years and have been married for four. They are both active as deacons in their church and 
perform a great deal of community volunteer work, including teen mentoring programs. Applicant and his wife do not drink alcohol at any time because it is 
inconsistent with their values and their lifestyle.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E (personal 
conduct), Guideline G (alcohol), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears he deliberately omitted from his SF 86 six alcohol-related 
criminal offenses between 1992 and 2000 (SOR &para; 1.a), the fact that three of those offenses were charged under the UCMJ (SOR &para;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1.b), the fact he was also 
charged with two other criminal offenses (SOR &para; 1.c), and that he twice completed treatment and counseling for alcohol abuse (SOR &para; 1.d). Department 
Counsel submitted sufficient information to support these allegations. Applicant has denied any intent to falsify his answers to the SF 86 questions; however, 
available information establishes Applicant should have answered "yes" to the questions at issue here, but that he deliberately omitted the information about his 
drinking and his arrests because he was concerned about the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">adverse impact it would have on his ability to keep his clearance, which he needs to do his job. 
Based on all of the foregoing, Guideline E DC 2<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, I have reviewed the listed mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline E, and conclude none apply. This case is somewhat unusual in that more 
than four years have elapsed since Applicant submitted his security questionnaire and he was interviewed by DSS about his omissions. Nonetheless, his 
falsification must be viewed as recent, because the SF 86 at issue is the basis for the current adjudication of his clearance, and his decision to omit that 
information, without any attempt to promptly correct his omissions, precludes any claims of mitigation or lack of intent. Further, the facts Applicant omitted are 
directly probative of his judgment, reliability, and overall character.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting a security clearance. Because false or incomplete information given in the 
questionnaire is capable of affecting the way government investigators obtain complete and accurate information about an applicant, it is material. Moreover, a 
false answer is material even if there is no proof it actually influenced Applicant's background investigation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knowingly submitted a questionnaire 
devoid of any adverse information from his background. Further, he did so to protect his own interests, conduct which is directly at odds with the government's 
need to rely on the clearance holder to look after the national interest as his own. In light of the foregoing, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also alleged Applicant's deliberate falsification of his SF 86 constituted a knowing and willful false statement to a government agency 
concerning a matter within its jurisdiction, thereby violating federal criminal law expressed in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 (SOR &para; 3.a). Criminal conduct is a security 
concern because a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules and regulations governing the 
protection of classified information.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The criminal activity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. Available information 
supports the government's allegation in SOR &para; 3. Here, Applicant committed a single serious crime, but was not charged. Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, a review of the listed mitigating conditions shows none apply here. For the same reasons Applicant's falsification is recent under Guideline E, it must 
be considered recent under Guideline J as well. Also, this crime is isolated only in the sense it is the only one alleged in the SOR. Just as I would have to at least 
consider as part of the entire record other instances of dishonesty even if they were not alleged, I cannot ignore the other criminal conduct in Applicant's 
background. Combined with his deliberate falsifications about that conduct, I cannot conclude there is "clear evidence of rehabilitation"as contemplated under 
Guideline J.<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the government alleged Applicant abused alcohol from 1990 until October 2000 (SOR &para; 2.a), and that he was involved in several alcohol-related 
criminal offenses (SOR &para; 2.b). The government also alleged Applicant underwent a three-month inpatient alcohol treatment program in 1997, and was 
diagnosed as alcohol dependent (SOR &para; 2.c), and that he entered but failed to complete court-ordered alcohol treatment from August 2000 to August 2001 
(SOR &para; 2.d). As expressed in Guideline G, excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government 
submitted sufficient information to support the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a, 2.b and 2.c. However, available information indicates Applicant actually completed 
the outpatient treatment referred to in SOR &para; 2.d. Based on the facts established by the government's information, Guideline G DC 1,<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 3,<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 6<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having reviewed the available mitigating conditions under Guideline G, I conclude MC 2<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply as well. Applicant has been sober for more than 
five years, and has made significant, long-lasting changes in his lifestyle that are conducive to continued sobriety. It is unlikely he will return to drinking at all, 
much less in a manner that might raise a question about his suitability for clearance. I conclude Guideline G for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has successfully demonstrated his alcohol problems are behind him. However, doubts about Applicant's suitability for continued access to classified 
information persist because of his deliberate and multiple falsifications of his SF 86, made in knowing violation of federal criminal law. I am mindful of the 
unusually long time that has passed and the positive changes in Applicant's life since he submitted that form. Nonetheless, a person's candor and 
trustworthiness are such fundamental facets of the industrial personnel security program as to require more than the passage of time and a demonstration of 
clean living and reliable work performance to overcome concerns about deliberate false statements. I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have 
applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-26156.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> of Applicant's 
deliberate falsifications motivated by concern for personal interests, taken in the context of all of the information before me shows that reasonable doubts 
persist about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the 
government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has otherwise 
overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
