</P>

<P>	On March 20, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied
or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached.</P>

<P>	Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about May 21, 1997.</P>

<P>	Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.
Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 17,
1997.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or
mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on August 7, 1997,
and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on
September 10, 1997.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted drug abuse militates
against the granting of a security clearance.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File
of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 30 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who
seeks a clearance on her behalf.</P>

<P><U>Criterion H - Drug involvement</U></P>

<P>	1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant used methamphetamine (crystal), from about June of 1985 until
at least October 31, 1995.  She "started using it recreationally," however, "[b]y 87, . . . [she] was
using crystal daily, about 1/4 gram per day. . . . [She] was purchasing weekly, paying about $80 for
1/16 gram.  This pattern continued through Oct 95" (Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at page 3).</P>

<P>	1.c.  The Applicant was arrested in June of 1988, and subsequently pled guilty to Driving
Under the Influence of Alcohol.  She admits that she "also may have had some crystal meth in . . .
[her] system" (GX 5 at page 1).</P>

<P>	1.d.  The Applicant was again arrested in March of 1990, and subsequently pled guilty to
being Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance, to wit: Methamphetamine (GX 5 at pages 1~2,
and GX 7).</P>

<P>	1.e.  The Applicant was arrested a third time on October 31, 1995, and subsequently pled
guilty to being Under the  Influence of a Controlled Substance, which she admits was "crystal" (GX
5 at page 2, and GX 6).</P>

<P>	1.f.  The Applicant received treatment on February 22, 1996, and again on March 11, 1996,
for a condition diagnosed as chemical addiction, specifically, to crystal methamphetamine (GX 3
at page 1, and GX 5 at page 4).</P>

<P>	1.g.  The Applicant also used marijuana "less than five times . . . between about 90 to early
93" (GX 5 at page 3).</P>

<P><U>Mitigation</U></P>

<P>	In her Answer, the Applicant avers that she continues to attend Narcotics Anonymous, and
intends no future drug abuse (GX 3 at pages 1~2).</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 and Section F.3. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and
conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration
in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions<FONT FACE="Times"> should be followed in every case
</FONT>according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative
of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Drug Involvement</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner
that deviates from approved medical direction);</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession, . . . purchase . . . .</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common
sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P> 		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequence involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in
the future.</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have
a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or
conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must make out a <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U> case under Criterion H (drug involvement)
which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational
connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely
to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P>	The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. The Government must be able to place a high
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at
all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in her
private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude
towards security rules and regulations.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant's methamphetamine abuse spans a period of more than ten years, and
culminated with her addiction to the drug.  Her extensive abuse is also evidenced by three drug
related convictions, and her last usage was only 20 months ago (the date of the Government's FORM
ends the time line used for adjudication purposes in this case).  It now appears that the Applicant
intends no future drug abuse, however, it is too soon to say that her fairly recent addictive usage is
not of present security significance.</P>

<P>	Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U>
case regarding her drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of
Criterion H, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden
of persuasion under Criterion H.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1:<CENTER>AGAINST THE APPLICANT</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	a.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	b.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	c.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	d.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	e.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	f.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	g.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and
<STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <U>supra</U>.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
