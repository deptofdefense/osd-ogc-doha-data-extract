<P>Applicant, an 82-year-old widow, has experienced financial problems largely beyond her control. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged a security 
concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant replied to the SOR on August 11, 2004. Her answers were mixed, admitting in part and 
denying in part the SOR allegations, and she requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on June 21, 2005, and the case was assigned to me June 27, 2005. Thereafter, a notice of hearing was 
issued scheduling the hearing for September 14, 2005. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the 
transcript September 27, 2005. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is an 82-year-old widow who is seeking to retain a security clearance she has held for decades. From November 1962 to November 1990, Applicant 
worked as a civil servant for the federal government. She held a security clearance for most of her federal employment. </P> 
 
<P>She retired in 1990, but she resumed her employment in March 1991 as a contractor at her former place of employment. She went back to work to generate 
some addition income due to her husband's illness (diabetes). Her husband's condition grew progressively worse (he went blind in 1992) and progressively 
generated more out-of-the-pocket expenses not covered by health insurance. Applicant's husband passed away in 1995 or 1996.</P> 
 
<P>Before her husband's illness, Applicant's financial situation was stable. In January 1994, in an effort to address her financial troubles, Applicant filed a Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petition (SOR &para;1.h), which is sometimes called a wage earner repayment plan (Exhibit 11). Applicant paid about $5,083 under the plan, but was 
unable to make all payments called for by the plan. The court dismissed the case in May 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant took a new loan on her home in October 1997. In 1999 she got behind on her monthly mortgage payments. This delinquency led her to file a Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petition (SOR &para; 1.g) in November 1999 (Exhibit 12). Her total liabilities were $153,735.28, of which the home loan was $135,697.72. 
Subsequently, in October 2001, the court denied Applicant's proposed Chapter 13 plan, and in November 2001, the court dismissed the case.</P> 
 
<P>Foreclosure action (SOR &para; 1.e) followed the dismissal of the bankruptcy case. According to the loan history (Exhibit 14), the foreclosure concluded in August 
2002 and there is no balance due. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was sold a high-end vacuum cleaner in approximately 1996 or 1997. The purchase  was made through a financing company. In December 1998, the 
company filed a lawsuit against Applicant seeking payment on the installment contract (Exhibit 13). In March 1999, Applicant agreed to a consent judgment for 
$1,451.36 (the amount alleged in &para; 1.a), plus attorney fees of $217.70 and costs of $70.00, for a total of $1,739.06 (the amount alleged in &para; 1.b). It appears this 
judgment has not yet been satisfied. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is indebted to a state tax authority money for unpaid taxes in the amount of about $2,400 (SOR &para; 1.f). Applicant entered into an installment payment 
plan with the state agreeing to pay $100 monthly. She is making payments as agreed.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is indebted for a charged off bad debt for $1,545 stemming from a credit card account. It was charged off in about September 1998, the same time she 
was experiencing her financial problems.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is indebted for a charged off bad debt for $7,168 stemming from a car loan. The car was a lemon. It was charged off in about September 1999, the 
same time she was experiencing her financial problems.</P> 
 
<P>As a retired federal employee, Applicant receives a retirement annuity with a net monthly payment of $1,989.59. She's also entitled to receive money from her 
husband's retirement annuity with a net monthly payment of $1,134.00. She works no more than 32-hours per week for a hourly wage.   </P> 
 
<P>Also contributing to Applicant's financial problems are her two adult, ne'er-do-well sons who have taken advantage of their mother, including living with her 
without making any financial contribution. One son, who is HIV positive and a problem drinker, has physically abused Applicant.  In addition, Applicant 
experienced a period of unemployment from October 2000 to March 2001. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security </P> 
 
<P>clearance is not a determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has 
established for granting a clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts or unexplained affluence. An individual 
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual 
who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence, taken as a whole, demonstrates a 
history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> These matters raise a security concern under the 
guideline. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude Applicant successfully explained and mitigated the security concern. Applicant's 
financial problems were largely beyond her control,<A HREF="03-06760.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> as evidenced by her husband's prolonged illness starting in about 1990 and ending with his demise in 
1995 or 1996. Applicant's financial situation was stable until her husband's prolonged illness. Also, I was impressed with her demeanor and serious attitude she 
displayed during the hearing, and I conclude her financial problems did not result from high living or financially irresponsible behavior. In reaching this 
conclusion, I considered that Applicant is 82 years old and living on a fixed income, other than what she earns when working part-time. This circumstance 
limits her ability to repay old, charged off debt after she has paid for her normal living expenses. In addition, Applicant's total delinquent debt is less than 
$15,000, of which only the state tax debt is being actively pursued for collection, and she is making monthly payments to the state. Finally, Applicant receives 
substantial credit for her many years of employment with the federal government holding a security clearance without a negative incident or problem. Viewing 
the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant is not at risk of engaging illegal or unethical acts to meet her financial obligations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the evidence 
as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and other appropriate factors and guidelines in the 
Directive.   </SPAN></P>
