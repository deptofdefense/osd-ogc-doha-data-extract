<P>The Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and of Greece; and as such, admits allegiance to both countries.  He travels to Greece on a yearly basis using 
a Greek passport, but since December of 2000 has let his Greek passport expire.  He owns stock and property in Greece, may have to serve in the Greek Army, 
and plans to live in Greece when he retires.  He also has a cousin who is an officer in the Greek Air Force, and a friend who is an electronic technician for the 
Greek Air Force.  As the Applicant has demonstrated a foreign preference for Greece, and the possibility of influence through his cousin and friend, his 
employer's request for a security clearance on his behalf is denied.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 19, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on July 19, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on September 11, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on September 19, 2002, and Applicant's Reply was received on or about October 16, 2002.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on November 1, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's foreign preference and possible foreign 
influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 30 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.i.  The Applicant was born in the United States to parents who were dual citizens of the United States and of Greece (Government Exhibit 
(GX 6 at page 1).  At age 7 he was taken back to Greece, where he lived until age 17 as a dual national (<EM>id</EM>).  At the age of 17, he went to the U.S. embassy, 
obtained a U.S. passport, and returned to the U.S. (<EM>ibid</EM>).  He travels to Greece on a yearly basis, and used his Greek passport to travel there until that passport 
expired in December of 2000 (GX 6 at pages 2 and 3).  His present intention is not to renew his Greek passport (GX 4 at page 3, and Reply at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.~1.e., and 1.h.  He admits equal allegiance to both the U.S. and to Greece (Reply at page 2).  He is subject to six months of military service in the Greek 
Army, but would not bear arms against the United States (GX 4 at pages 4 and 6, GX 6 at page 1, and Reply at page 2).  Through his father, he owns property 
and stock in Greece, and the Applicant plans to live in Greece when he retires (GX 6 at page 3, and Reply at pages 3~4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.  The Applicant's parents are dual nationals, as previously mentioned, and both now live in Greece (GX 6 at pages 2 and 3).  His father is a retired 
physician, and his mother is a homemaker (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b.  The Applicant's cousin is an officer in the Greek Air Force (GX 6 at page 2, and Reply at page 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.c.  The Applicant's friend is an electronics technician for the Greek Air Force (GX 6 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The country to which the Applicant admits equal allegiance to is a long-term ally of the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">9.  . . . acting, so as to serve the interests of another government in preference to interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Relatives . . . or associates who are connected with any foreign government;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8.  A substantial financial interest in a country . . . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family members, ( . . . father, mother . . . ) . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in position to be exploited by a 
foreign power . . . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct or situation, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of Greece and of the United States, he states that he bears equal allegiance to both countries, and he retains an expired Greek 
passport.  Despite being appraised of the <EM>Money Memo</EM> ("Guide to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign 
Preference Adjudication Guidelines," dated September 1, 2000) (GX 5), he has expressed no intention to surrender that passport.  Furthermore, he not only 
pledges dual allegiance to another country, but he also has a financial interest there and plans to retire in Greece.  This shows some preference for Greece over 
the interests of the United States; and as such, he can not expect to be intrusted with a security clearance from the United States.  Guideline C must be found 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his parents who reside outside of the United States, the Applicant has demonstrated that his immediate family members "are not agents of a foreign power 
or [not] in a position to be exploited by a foreign power," as required by the first mitigating condition under Foreign Influence.  The same can not be said, 
however, for his cousin and a friend who are members of or work for the Greek Air Force.  The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that they could not exert a 
foreign influence over him.  Therefore, Guideline B is also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his foreign preference.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under 
Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
