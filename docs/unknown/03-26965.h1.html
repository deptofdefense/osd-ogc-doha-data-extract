<P>Applicant's foreign family ties have been mitigated and do not raise a security concern.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 11, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 21, 2005, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on April 11, 2005, consisting of seven documents, 
referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on April 25, 2005, and he submitted a reply dated May 20, 2005, with attachments.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on July 7, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 40 years of age.  He holds a Ph.D 
in electrical engineering from a University in the United States.  He is employed as a Principal Systems Scientist for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security 
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in China in 1965.  He left China in 1990.  He became a United States citizen in September 2001.  His father, who was a Chinese 
University professor for thirty-eight years of his life is now a permanent resident of the United States.  His father is also a citizen of the People's Republic of 
China but resides in Canada with the Applicant's sister.  The Applicant's father is planning to apply for his United States citizenship when he is eligible.  The 
Applicant further indicates that his father is not an agent of the Chinese Government.  The University in China for whom the Applicant's father taught was not 
and has never been affiliated in any way with the Chinese Government.  The Applicant's father has no financial interests in China and the only person that he 
contacts at all in China is his brother, once every three months or so.  Although he used to live with the Applicant, he no longer resides with him.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant also has aunts and uncles who are citizens and residents of China.  None of his relatives in China have ever been employed with or for the 
Chinese Government, nor have they ever been associated with the Communist party.  They are employed as farmers, mechanics, street vendors, real estate 
agents and one owns a food processing factory.  The Applicant has no contact with any of his aunts and uncles in China.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant traveled to China for a two week vacation in December 2001.  The Applicant has no financial interests in China and little contact with anyone 
there.  Since 1990 when he left China, he has had little or no contact with any of his relatives.  During an interview with the Defense Security Service the 
Applicant stated that he is loyal to the United States and that nothing could place him in a position where he would be forced to question that loyalty.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 4).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excerpts from the Applicant's personnel file, maintained by his employer, specifically his annual employee reviews, indicate that his work performance ratings 
either "exceed or meet job requirements".   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that immediate family member(s), spouse, father, mother, sons daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates(s) in questions are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) 
and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules 
and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign influence has a direct 
and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 40 year old Chinese born Applicant obtained his doctoral degree in electrical engineering in the United States.  He became a United States citizen in 
September 2001.  He has  little or no contact with any of his relatives in China.  His father is a permanent resident of the United States, living in Canada and is 
planning to apply for United States citizenship when he is eligible.  None of the Applicant's family members in China or in the United States have ever been 
affiliated with, employed for, or agents of, the Chinese Government, the Communist party, or any other adverse organization.  Therefore, mitigating condition 
<EM>(1) a determination that the immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question would not constitute an unacceptable security risk </EM>applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although his aunts and uncles still reside in China, he has only casual and infrequent contact with them.  Mitigating condition<EM> (3) contact and correspondence 
with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent </EM>also applies.  The Applicant has substantial financial interests in the United States and none in China.  In a 
sworn statement to the Defense Security Service the Applicant stated that  he is loyal to the United States and that there is no situation that could ever occur that 
would force him to reveal classified information to any unauthorized individual no matter what their relationship to the Applicant.  He has no foreign ties or 
contacts that could potentially influence him.  Therefore, I find that there is no situation that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in 
his compromise of classified information.  Accordingly, the Applicant's request for a security clearance must be granted under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline  B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P>
