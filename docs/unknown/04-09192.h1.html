<P>From 1997 to 2001, Applicant and his wife incurred approximately $33,000 in delinquent accounts. Between 1988 and April 2002, he was charged with 
criminal offenses on seven different occasions.  Six of the offenses related to insufficient funds checks. He paid off about half of the delinquent accounts.  
Although making payments towards other delinquent debts, the record evidence is insufficient to conclude he pays on a consistent basis.  It is too soon to

<P>On January 10, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F, Financial Considerations, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 10, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel was ready to proceed 
on January 6, 2006. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on March 9, 2006.  The case was transferred to me on March 14, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of 
hearing was issued on March 14, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 27, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted seven 
exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-7.  The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own 
behalf, and submitted 11 exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-T. Applicant Exhibits A-T were admitted without objection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record was 
kept open until April 10, 2006.  No additional documents were submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2006.</SPAN></P>

December 1999, he was charged and found guilty of Petit Theft.  On May 12, 2000, he was charged with Fraud - Utter False Instrument. He pled guilty. On

put the wrong account number on the checks. They were off by one number.  They had written ten checks before realizing the mistake.<A HREF="04-09192.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The charges in &para;&para; 1.d,

the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607."  Although he listed a July 1989 and a July 2000 bad check 
charge in response to question 21, he did not list his arrests alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.c, 2.d, and 2.g. He did not list a July 22, 1998, arrest for Fraud Insufficient

the more information provided, the less problems later.  She does not recall specifically talking to the Applicant but her records indicate she spoke with him in 
2003.  He asked her about whether he needed to list some bad check charges. She told him that he needed to list them.  She does not recall telling him that he 
did not need to list certain information on his security clearance application.  She would never advise applicants to withhold information that was relevant to the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial</STRONG> <STRONG>Considerations  </STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has incurred significant delinquent debts. The total approximate balance was once $33,010. Under Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.1: (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC 3 E2.A6.1.2.3: (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  
uch of the debt went delinquent between 1997 - 2001.  Applicant's failure to address these delinquent debts until after applying for a security clearance in 
2003 indicates either an inability or an unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Although he blames his wife for all the delinquent debt, ultimately, it was his 
responsibility to see that his finances were in order.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the delinquent debt, Applicant admits to being charged with offenses dealing with bad checks on six occasions from April 1989 to April 2002. FC 
DC E2.A6.1.2.2: (<EM>Deceptive illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing 
deceptive loan statements, or other intentional financial breaches of trust.</EM>) applies based on his history of bad check offenses..    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline F can be mitigated.  I find that none of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) apply. Although 
Applicant has paid the debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j and 1.k, approximately $17,161 of the debt remains unpaid.  He maintains that he is making 
payments on these debts but has failed to provide proof that he has been making payments on a routine basis. All  the receipts submitted in support of this 
assertion were  months old. The record was held open for Applicant to provide additional proof that he is making regular payments but nothing was submitted.  
Although he blames his ex-wife for all of the delinquent debt, he should have been aware something was wrong with his finances when he began to face 
criminal charges for writing bad checks.  He was ultimately responsible for paying his bills as well as balancing his checking account.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) has the potential to apply since Applicant is recently divorced.  However, the divorce does 
not appear to have made a significant financial impact. In fact, his financial situation has improved since he has been working overseas.  His security clearance 
application indicates that he was unemployed for four months from November 2002 to April 1, 2003, and for about a year from February 1999 to February 
2000.  This may have had some impact on his financial situation. Applicant did not bring up these periods of unemployment at the hearing so what affect it had 
on his finances is unknown. Since 2004, he has held a steady job which pays approximately $10,000 per month.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find for the Applicant with respect to SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j and 1.k since he has paid these debts.  He has made great progress in resolving his financial 
situation but still has a long way to go. Applicant appears to be making payments towards his debts.  However, I cannot conclude that he is making payments on 
a timely regular basis. He also has not provided information  to prove that the debts in &para;&para; 1.d and 1.e and the debts in &para;&para; 1.g and 1.h are duplicates of each other.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern remains under Guideline F. It is too early to conclude that Applicant's financial situation is completely under control.  I find against him 
under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of criminal conduct since 1988 beginning with a Resisting Arrest and Disturbing the Peace charge.  In 1989, he was prosecuted for his 
first bad check offense.  Between 1998 and April 2002, he was charged with bad check offenses at least five times during this period.  As such, Criminal 
Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>)<EM> </EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find none of the mitigating conditions apply under criminal conduct.  Since 1998, Applicant has been charged with a criminal offense on average once a year. 
He maintains that these charges all occurred at the same time but took several years to get through the court system.  He has not provided  sufficient information 
to support this assertion. Considering his history of bad check writing, I cannot conclude the behavior was not recent.  The conduct cannot be considered 
isolated, since he was charged six times.  Due to his history of writing bad checks, it is too soon to conclude that he has been successfully rehabilitated.  I find 
against Applicant under Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not list all of his criminal charges on his security clearance application in response to question 26.  He also did not list his delinquent debts in 
response to questions 38 and 39 on his security clearance application.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2:  (<EM>The deliberate 
omission, concealment or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form 
used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or 
award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies with respect to Applicant deliberately withholding three criminal charges, SOR &para;&para; 2.c, 2.d, and 2.g, in response to 
question 26 on his security clearance application.  I do not find credible his claims that his FSO told him he did not need to list the charges.  I find the FSO 
more credible.  Although she could not remember the specific conversation with Applicant, she was adamant that she would never tell an applicant to withhold 
information that was relevant to a question on a security clearance. She has had over ten years experience as an FSO and demonstrated a keen insight as to the 
responsibilities of her job.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I do not give much weight to the e-mail Applicant provided since it is rather vague and there was no opportunity to question the program manager who took 
part in the e-mail exchange.  The e-mail was not conclusive. The program manager's response indicates that Applicant should speak with the FSO directly and 
to do whatever she tells you to do.  The FSO credibly testified that she told him to list his bad check charges on the security clearance application.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I also conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application with respect to questions 38 and 39 by deliberately failing to list his 
delinquent debts.  I find implausible his claims that his wife was responsible for paying all the bills and that he had no idea there were any delinquent debts 
considering the extent of the debt.  Much of the delinquent accounts were placed for collection. A judgment was entered against Applicant with respect to the 
debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.d.  At the very least, Applicant should have been on notice in the late 1990s or early 2000 that something was not quite right with the 
family finances since he was facing prosecution for bad check offenses.  Given the extent of the debt, I do not find his explanations as to why he did not list his 
delinquent debt credible.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant's failure to provide complete and accurate information on his security clearance application is 
pertinent to a determination of his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. There is no evidence that Applicant attempted to supplement his security clearance 
application with the omitted information. I find against the Applicant under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
