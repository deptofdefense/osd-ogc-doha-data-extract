<P>Applicant's possession and use of a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen demonstrated a foreign preference and was not mitigated where Applicant 
had neither surrendered the passport nor obtained formal approval for its use, and intended to renew and continue to use his foreign passport. Applicant's 
falsification of his security clearance questionnaire suggested he could not be relied upon to tell the truth if the truth presented potential adverse consequences 
to his personal interests. Clearance denied.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 6 February 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 27 
arch 2002 and 12 May 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 1 August 2002, and I received the case 
the same day. I issued a notice of hearing on 3 October 2002 for a hearing on 24 October 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   At the hearing, the Government presented one exhibit--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented no exhibits, and the testimony of 
one witness, himself. DOHA received the transcript on 4 November 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the foreign preference allegations of the SOR<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. He denied falsifying his 
security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 36-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Nigeria in 1966, making him a citizen of Nigeria.<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He emigrated to the U.S. in 1979, when he was twelve, and lived with his older 
brother. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in July 1994.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a native speaker of English, the official language of Nigeria (Tr. 37), and Nigerian. Although he speaks with an accent indicative of his birth 
country, his education in grade school in Nigeria included instruction in both English and Nigerian. His education in the U.S.--junior high, high school, and 
college--was all conducted in English, and included instruction in the subject of English (Tr. 51-55). Applicant successfully completed each level of his U.S. 
education, obtaining an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering in 1990 (G.E. 1, Tr. 34-35, 54).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant possesses a Nigerian passport. He used this passport to travel to Nigeria after becoming a U.S. citizen (in July 1994, November 1997, and November 
1998). He renewed his Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen (Answer, 12 May 2002; Tr. 40). He considers himself a dual citizen of Nigeria and the 
U.S. (Tr. 36-37). He has not expressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship or surrender his foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 27 August 2002, Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) by answering "no" to question 15, which asked Applicant if he 
had possessed a foreign passport within the last seven years,<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and "no" to question 16, which asked Applicant if he had traveled outside the U.S. within the last 
seven years.<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> In fact, Applicant possessed a valid Nigerian passport and had used it to travel to Nigeria in at least July 1994, November 1997, and November 
1998.<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 27 March 2002, Applicant answered the falsification allegations of the SOR: </SPAN></P> 
<P><STRONG>Question #15: I do admit that I answered "NO" to question number 15: Your Foreign Activities-- Passport. in the last 7 years, have you had an active 
passport that was issued by a foreign government?</STRONG></P> 
<P>Initially or at the time I was filling the form (<EM>ESPQ Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86)</EM>, I did not interpret Nigeria as a foreign country since I 
was born and grew up from Nigeria and both my parents and all relatives are from Nigeria. I misread or misunderstood the word foreign country. I thought that 
foreign country referred to other countries like England, Russia, and Germany etc., that Nigeria was not included. That was why I answered <STRONG>NO </STRONG>to question 
number 1 5. I honestly did not intend to deny or falsify my response to the questions.</P> 
<P>Since Nigeria by Law permits dual citizenship to all her citizens, I still maintain Nigeria Citizens like most Nigerians that are American citizens who by default 
have dual citizenship. This may also be applicable to other countries of the world that permit their citizens to have dual citizenship, they all may not claim their 
country of origin as a foreign country, rather, and they maintain dual citizenship. If Nigeria does not permit dual citizenship, then I will see Nigeria as a foreign 
country to me since I have become American citizen by naturalization. But I am Nigeria citizen by birth. Based on the above reasons, that was why when I was 
filling the form, I misread or misunderstood the work "foreign country" I did not interpret my Nigeria Passport as a foreign passport; hence, I answered <STRONG>NO </STRONG>to 
Question #16. Furthermore, if my answer were <STRONG>NO </STRONG>on question #3 of the <EM>ESPQ Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86 </EM>that I do not have dual 
citizenship, then it would mean that I intentionally meant to falsify on having a foreign passport, rather, I answered <STRONG>YES</STRONG>, that I do have dual citizenship and the 
country is Nigeria. </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P><STRONG>Question #16: I do admit that I answered "NO" to question number 16: Foreign Countries You Have Visited Have you traveled outside the United 
States on other than official U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years? (Travel as a dependent contractor must be listed.) Do not repeat travel 
covered in modules 4, 5, &amp; 6." </STRONG></P> 
<P>I answered <STRONG>NO </STRONG>in question number 16 because I did not interpret Nigeria to be foreign to me; and in this question <STRONG>#16</STRONG>, a section illustrated that, <STRONG>"do not repeat 
travels covered in modules 4,5 and 6" </STRONG>and that was why I did not repeat again my travels to Nigeria here. All the travels I made were destined to Nigeria only. 
I do recollect that the issue was addressed when the special agent interviewed me, and I said to him that the only time I stopped at other countries was within the 
airport when the airplane stopped because of mechanical fault, or to either refuel and for connection flight. Other than these, I have not visited any other 
country. My response on these modules <STRONG>(4,5 and 6</STRONG>) must disclose my traveling statistics to Nigeria. Again, since the form stated that, <STRONG>"do not repeat</STRONG>  <STRONG>travels 
covered in modules 4, 5 and 6", </STRONG>it made me to think or interpret that the question #15 did not reference to the travels I made to Nigeria. Hence I answered <STRONG>NO.</STRONG></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Please, I did not intentionally falsify any material facts on the ESPQ Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86; neither did I deliberately fail to disclose 
that I visited Nigeria. When the Special Agent interviewed me, I recall that I made clear my travels with him, because this issue was addressed. I also do recall 
that I explained the purpose of my travels that it was for pleasure or visiting my relatives in Nigeria. I also do recall that the issue about my dual citizenship was 
addressed. He asked me to explain to him what I meant by dual citizenship, I did and we addressed it. In summary, I honestly did not intend to falsify or 
deliberately fail to disclose information requested on my travels to the best of my knowledge. There is a reason why most Nigerian citizens who are American 
citizen prefer and like to maintain both their Nigerian passport and American Passport. The reason is the ease of searching and harassment in the airport when 
one travels. The reason why it appeared as if I falsified or deliberately fail to disclose the information was that I initially misinterpreted the word "foreign 
country" and did not interpret Nigeria as one of the foreign countries referenced by the form. Again my being a citizen of Nigeria by birth and Nigeria 
permitting her citizens' dual citizenship contributed to why I misinterpreted the form. With this Statement of Reasons, I now know that the form included 
Nigeria as a foreign country to me. I also was mislead when the form said that, "do not repeat the travels covered in module 4, 5 &amp; 6, hence I did not repeat my 
travels to Nigeria in the question <STRONG>#16.</STRONG>  (Emphases in original).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's testimony repeated his assertion that he answered both questions truthfully because Nigeria is not a "foreign" country as to him. He maintained this 
position despite acknowledging that the form he was completing was a U.S. Government form (Tr. 38, 48-49). He maintained this position despite 
acknowledging that he understood that "foreign" included Nigeria when he took his naturalization oath and renounced "all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign 
potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which you had been a subject"(Tr. 36). He maintained this position despite acknowledging that the travel question 
specifically asks for "travel outside the U.S. (Tr. 55), that Nigeria is a country in Africa--a different continent than the U.S.-- and certainly is outside the U.S. 
(Tr. 55-56), and that he had not disclosed being in Nigeria in response to questions 4, 5, or 6 (Tr. 56-59).<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has been a dual citizen of a foreign country and the United States since his naturalization in 1994, Applicant's foreign citizenship possesses 
little security significance if based solely on his birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign 
Preference, he must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on 
the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest 
in ensuring those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under 
this assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant makes no claim to prefer his U.S. citizenship to his foreign citizenship, and his conduct confirms that assessment. Although Applicant may be proud 
of his U.S. citizenship, he has maintained significant aspects of his foreign citizenship. While his oath of allegiance to the U.S. and his rejection of allegiance to 
any foreign government in the citizenship oath is powerful evidence of a preference for U.S. citizenship, the citizenship oath does not automatically operate to 
terminate his citizenship rights in his birth country. His native country permits, perhaps even encourages dual citizenship. The fact that his native country 
permits dual citizenship would ordinarily not affect the analysis of Applicant's preference. However, in this case Applicant reasserted his foreign citizenship and 
his preference for that citizenship when he used his Nigerian passport to arrange travel to Nigeria and renewed his Nigerian passport, after his naturalization. He 
remains in possession of that passport, and does not intend to surrender it.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding possession and use of his Nigerian passport, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference.<A HREF="01-08484.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> His dual citizenship is 
not based solely on his birth in a foreign country, but on his active assertion of his citizenship rights in that country. Applicant's voluntary assertion of his 
foreign citizenship rights occurred after he became a naturalized  U.S. citizen. Although his conduct is lawful, there is no evidence that the conduct was 
formally sanctioned by the United States. Applicant has expressed no willingness to renounce his foreign citizenship; indeed he essentially insists that he will 
maintain and exercise active dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum only complicates matters for Applicant. The Memorandum states that Applicant's past possession and use of his foreign passport 
can be mitigated only if Applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. Applicant has undertaken neither action, and 
gives no indication that he will surrender his Nigerian passport. Further, his demonstrated conduct in reasserting his foreign citizenship so soon after acquiring 
U.S. citizenship casts serious doubt on his fitness for access to classified information, and presents an unacceptable level of risk that he has a foreign preference. 
I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant's explanation for his omission defies credibility. If accepted, the Government would 
surrender any meaningful assessment of plain language questions to any applicant's subjective--and nonsensical--interpretation. The omissions had the 
potential to influence the course of the background investigation. Because Applicant had resided in the U.S. for many years, the fact that he truthfully disclosed 
his dual citizenship status in question 3 of the SCA and the foreign background of his spouse, relatives, and associates in questions 8, 9, and 10, does not 
operate to disclose either his valid foreign passport or his travel outside the U.S. His disclosure of his foreign passport and foreign travel to the DSS agent does 
not constitute a good faith disclosure of the omitted information. Applicant's I find Guideline E. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

his spouse whom Applicant lived with as a boy. Applicant did this to be consistent with the false information placed on his application for U.S. citizenship (Tr.
