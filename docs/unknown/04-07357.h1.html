<P>Applicant's alcohol abuse--punctuated by alcohol-related arrests in April 1995 and March 2000, and incidents of blacking out or passing out until July 2004--was not mitigated because Applicant

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant challenges the 28 May 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of his clearance because of alcohol 
consumption.<A HREF="04-07357.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 17 August 2005, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 26 January 2006 and I convened a hearing 1 March 2006. DOHA received the 
transcript 8 March 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the Guideline G (Alcohol) allegations of SOR subparagraphs 1.b.-1.g., but denied subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.h. Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact. 
Applicant--a 47-year-old security maintenance engineer for a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he appears to have held since approximately 1995. He  previously 
held a clearance while in the military.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of alcohol abuse from approximately 1985 to at least July 2004. During this time, he has two alcohol-related arrests and convictions, was counseled once at work for reporting to 
duty drunk, and experienced episodes of blacking out or passing out on many occasions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in April 1995 for driving while intoxicated (DWI)(.12% blood alcohol content [B.A.C.]) and sentenced to probation before judgment. Among the conditions for his probation, he 
was to attend an alcohol education course and attend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA). He successfully completed his probation, but acknowledges that he got nothing out of AA and the education course 
because he was only there to satisfy the terms of his probation. Sometime between 1999-2000, he reported to work drunk, and was counseled that he would lose his job if he did it again.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In March 2000, he was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUIA)(.13% B.A.C.) while on his way to work one morning, and ultimately convicted and sentenced. As a condition of 
his probation, he was required to attend an alcohol safety action program (ASAP). He successfully completed the terms of his probation. However, he acknowledges he got nothing out of the ASAP 
because he was only there to satisfy the terms of his probation. He considers himself lucky to have been arrested because if he had actually gotten to work, he probably would have been fired.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After his March 2000 arrest, he did not drink and drive, but he did continue to drink, occasionally to excess. In his September 2002 sworn statement (G.E. 4) he described what he referred to as his 
decreased level of drinking: 18 beers, a liter of gin, and a liter of rum every 60 days or so. However, when he traveled overseas on business, which he did frequently, he often drank to the point of 
passing out or blacking out. His mother and sister had asked him to cut back on his drinking, and he thought he might have a problem with alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In August 2004, Applicant answered DOHA alcohol interrogatories (G.E. 2). He described his drinking pattern as 12 beers per week and five hard liquor drinks per month. He indicated that he drank to 
the point of intoxication about four time a year, the last time being in July 2004.</P> 
 
<P>At hearing, Applicant stated he began drinking while still underage in 1977. His alcohol intake increased in 1985, when he entered the U.S. Air Force. After his DWI in April 1995, stopped drinking for 
a while before returning to alcohol. In 1996, he was drinking alone on occasion. After his March 2000 DUIA, he no longer drove after drinking, but did drink heavily while on his frequent business 
travel overseas, often while drinking alone in his hotel room. He estimates that between 2000 and July 2004 he drank to the point of blacking out or passing out 20-25 times.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant states, without corroboration, that he has not consumed any alcohol since July 2004, because the DOHA interrogatories were kind of a nuisance and he was tired of dealing with questions 
about his alcohol consumption. He acknowledges that stopping was not part of any concerted effort to do something about his drinking. He has not been involved in any counseling, AA participation, or 
12-step type programs that he took seriously. He now states that he has a problem with alcohol, but it took him awhile to recognize it.</P> 
 
<P>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-07357.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline G case in support of disqualifying conditions 1, 2,  and 5,<A HREF="04-07357.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. He has a long history of drinking to excess, 
with adverse consequences at work (counseling), while driving (two arrests), and while traveling (blackouts). His misconduct demonstrates a pattern of alcohol abuse which is recent. He did only the 
minimum to comply with the terms of his probations for his April 1995 and March  2000 arrests. While there is some evidence that Applicant has taken steps supportive of sobriety, and has not 
consumed alcohol since July 2004, those changes appear to be rooted in nothing more substantial than being tired of answering question about his drinking. The record evidence establishes his alcohol 
abuse and he had the burden of establishing extenuation, mitigation, or rehabilitation--a burden he did not meet. I cannot conclude that he is unlikely to return to abusive levels of drinking. Accordingly, 
I resolve Guideline G against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
