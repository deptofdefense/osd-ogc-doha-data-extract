<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns arising from his failure to resolve delinquent debts by paying the majority of his debts and making regular and

debt of such magnitude.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-21062.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR 
indicated security concerns were raised under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 26, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On December 20, 2004, I was assigned the case. On January 6, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on January 25, 2005.  The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  
Numerous documents were received and admitted into the record.  On February 2, 2005, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits, with explanation, the 13 debts listed in the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  
After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 42 year old software quality engineer, who has worked for a defense contractor since March 2002, and is seeking a security clearance. From 
April 2001 until March 2002, Applicant was unemployed.  He had been working on a satellite communication program when the program was sold to another 
company. All personnel working on the project were laid off. While unemployed, he received $200 a week unemployment compensation.  Applicant had to 
move to another state to find employment.  At his current job, Applicant is regarded by those who know him as a valued team player and a competent 
performer.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contacted a credit counseling service and received  helpful and useful information. He  learned he could handle the debts himself.  Applicant 
maintains a budget and keeps track of all his financial records in a book he carries with him and consults daily. (Tr. 52, App Ex Q) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is actively paying the credit card debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a, by making $170 monthly payments.  As of May 27, 2005, the amount due was 
$4,138.35 (App Ex CC) Applicant had some difficulty in attempting to pay his rental agreement, which was the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m.  The 
collection agency servicing the debt went out of business in early 2005.  Applicant then contacted the music store where the original debt was incurred.  The 
store agreed to accept a $335.34 lump sum payment to settle the debt. (App Ex AA)  On June 8, 2005, the final payment for this debt was posted to his account. 
(App Ex CC)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR lists 13 debts totaling approximately $ 13,000 owed to 13 creditors.  A summary of those debts and their current status follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof. Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case. Additionally, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-21062.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information to be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under 
agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties 
is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. Under Guideline F, an Applicant is not required to be debt free, but is 
required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds. Directive, E.2.A.6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant admitted he owed 13 debts totaling 
approximately $13,000.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From April 2001 until March 2002, Applicant was unemployed.  Mitigating Condition (MC) 3 (E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>) applies.  
After getting his current job, Applicant began repaying past due debts.  He has paid 12 of the 13 debts and is making regular and systematic $170 monthly 
payments on the sole remaining debt.  MC 6 (E2.A6.1.3.6.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) 
applies to this remaining debt. I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
