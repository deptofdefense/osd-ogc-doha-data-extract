<P>The Applicant misused Government technology equipment in 1997 and 1999 by using it to access pornography.  The Applicant's conduct was intentional and 
not mitigated.  In addition, the Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application concerning the circumstances of his resignation from Government service.

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 2, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on August 1, 2003, and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on August 12, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Hearings were held on September 5, 2003, and February 13, 2004, at which the Government presented 12 documentary exhibits, and called two witnesses.  
Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted six exhibits.  The final transcript was received on February 27, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>During his testimony on September 5, 2003, the Applicant revealed facts which may have been the basis for additional allegations against him.  (September 5, 
2003, Transcript (hereafter "Transcript One") at 62-65.) The Government asked for an adjournment in order to make an investigation.  Based on that 
investigation, on October 21, 2003, the Government made a Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons in accordance with paragraphs E3.1.10 and E3.1.13 of 
the Directive.  The Applicant filed an Objection to the Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons on November 5, 2003.  The objection was overruled and the 
SOR was amended as requested by the Government pursuant to paragraph E3.1.17 of the Directive.  (February 13, 2004, Transcript (hereafter "Transcript 
Two") at 3-5.)</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 55, married and has an Associate of Science degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Test Engineer, and he seeks to retain 
a Secret-level DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits 
and the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1999, the Applicant became involved in a physical altercation with his wife.  The altercation ended with the Applicant choking his wife.  He was 
subsequently arrested and charged with Spousal Abuse.  He plead guilty and was sentenced to one day in jail, fined, and placed on three years probation.  As a 
result of this incident, the Applicant successfully attended a year long domestic violence program.  (Applicant's Exhibit F.)  The Applicant testified that there 
have been no further incidents since this time.  (Transcript One at 22-25.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline M - Misuse of information technology)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because 
he has violated rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to the use of Government information technology systems.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant worked as a Government employee for 17 years.  He resigned from Government employment in July 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, the Applicant received a letter of reprimand for misuse of information technology.  Three pornographic pictures depicting sexual activity, one 
involving minor children, were found on a Government computer that he used.  The Applicant admitted that he had brought a computer file from home with the 
pictures on it and loaded it on his Government computer.  His explanation was that the pictures were placed on his home computer without his knowledge as a 
result of a malicious program called a Trojan Horse program.  The Applicant, according to his testimony, had downloaded a file from a news group to a floppy 
disc at his home.  The Applicant believed the file to be benign, but it was not.  Instead, the Applicant submits, the file had a "virus" which downloaded these 
pornographic pictures into his computer system at home and at work without his knowledge.  Other than his testimony, the Applicant submitted no other 
information or evidence to support his version of events.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2-3, and Government Exhibit 3; Transcript One at 27-44.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 11, 1999, the Applicant received an email concerning additional misuse of his Government computer system.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  The email 
specifically stated that the Applicant's computer had been used "for inappropriate purposes."  However, Government Exhibit 6 does not say what websites the 
Applicant went to.  Specifically, there is no evidence that the Applicant went to pornographic websites in August 1999, as alleged int the SOR. Accordingly, the 
Government has not met its burden with regards to allegations 2.b. and 3.c.  Those subparagraphs are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1999, the Applicant was the subject of an investigation into the use of two Government computers to access pornographic sites on the Internet.  
(Government Exhibits 7 and 11.)  The Applicant admitted going to sites concerned with "hentai" (Japanese cartoons).  The documentary evidence shows that 
the Applicant was on the pornographic websites for over an hour on several occasions.  (Government Exhibits 9 and 12.)  However, the Applicant denied 
specifically looking at pornographic sites.  Instead, he testified that the hentai connected websites that he went to had "pop-ups" to pornographic websites 
appear on his computer screen without his attempting to access them.  ("Pop-ups" are windows that appear within the main window and provide access to other 
websites.)  As the Applicant would close the pop-up windows, others would appear.  (Transcript Two at 81-84, 100-114.)  Once again, the Applicant submitted 
no other evidence to support his version of events.  The Applicant testified that he did not notify anyone at his workplace of his actions because he did not want 
to get in trouble.  (Transcript Two at 111-112.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's supervisor testified about his investigation of the Applicant's conduct.  (Government Exhibit 11, Transcript Two at 21-52.)  He specifically 
testified that he attempted to reproduce what the Applicant states happened on his Government computer concerning pornographic pop-ups in "hentai" sites and 
was unable to do so.  (Transcript Two at 45-47.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of the November 1999 incident, the Applicant's access to classified information was suspended on January 12, 2000.  The Applicant was 
subsequently suspended from his job indefinitely without pay effective April 6, 2000, because of his access being suspended.  (Government Exhibit 10.)  The 
Applicant filed a formal appeal of his job suspension.  As a result, a settlement agreement was entered into whereby the Applicant agreed not to seek 
employment with the United States Government for three years and that he would resign effective July 31, 2000.  (Government Exhibit 8.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 26, 2002, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that in the past seven years he had not either left a job by 
mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, or left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.  (Government Exhibit 1 at Question 20.)  
This statement was a false answer to a relevant question about how and why the Applicant had left Government service.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant argues that he did not leave his job because of allegations of misconduct.  Rather, he states that the Government created a situation after he was 
suspended without pay where he could not find other employment unless he resigned.  Accordingly, he did not believe the pornography allegations had anything 
to do with his leaving his job.  (Transcript Two at 89-93.)  The Applicant also submits that he admitted that his clearance had been suspended and/or that he had 
been debarred from government employment.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 32.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.  The Applicant's evaluations from his Government employment shows that he met expectations and received merit increases and bonuses.  
(Applicant's Exhibits A through E.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including the violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of spousal abuse, falsification and computer misuse that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on 
the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the  continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has physically abused his wife (Guideline J), 
misused Government computer systems (Guidelines M and E), and falsified a Security Clearance Application (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  As stated above, the Government did not prove that the email warning the Applicant received in August 1999 
(allegations 2.b. and 3.c.) related to pornography.  Those subparagraphs are found for the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has also mitigated SOR Paragraph 1 relating to the spousal abuse of his wife in 1999.  It is a serious criminal offense which the Applicant 
admitted (Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 2.)  However, the criminal conduct was isolated and was not recent, being four years ago at the time of the first 
hearing (Mitigating Conditions 1 and 2).  In addition, the Applicant testified and submitted documentary evidence showing that he had successfully attended 
domestic violence classes in order to learn how not to reoffend (Mitigating Condition 6.)  Accordingly, this paragraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's misuse of his Government computer in 1997 and 1999 has not been mitigated.  I have carefully considered the Applicant's extensive testimony 
concerning his conduct on these two occasions and do not find it sufficient.  The Applicant's elaborate theories of computer sabotage in 1997 are unsupported 
by any credible evidence.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have examined his explanations for what happened in 1999 and also find them wanting.  Based on all of the available evidence, including his failure to notify 
anyone of the alleged "problems with pop-ups," I find that he intentionally accessed pornographic sites on the Internet knowing he shouldn't.  His conduct in 
1999 is especially egregious because of the letter of reprimand he had received after the 1997 incident.  Disqualifying Conditions 3 and 4 are applicable to these 
allegations.  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply.  Subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.c. and Paragraph 2 are found against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's misuse of his Government computers is also cognizable under Guideline E.  His conduct involving pornography on Government computers 
increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress (Disqualifying Condition 4).  In addition, his repeated use of Government computers to access 
pornography brings Disqualifying Condition 5 into effect, "A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations."  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply.  
Subparagraphs 3.b. and 3.d. are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  Based on all of the available evidence, I find 
that the Applicant intentionally falsified question 20 on his Security Clearance Application.  I am persuaded that the Applicant knew, and knows, that he 
resigned his position with the Government because of an adverse action being taken against him.  Specifically, his clearance being suspended due to 
pornography.  The Applicant did admit that his security clearance had been suspended and/or that he had been debarred from Government employment.  
(Question 32 asks both questions.)  However, that was only half the truth and the Government should not have to find out the whole truth on its own.  Guideline 
E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  As set forth above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
