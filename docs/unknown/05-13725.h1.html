<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">This 44-year-old web designer has a history of financial problems that began with the breakup of her marriage, leading to a divorce in December 1997 and the financial problems that 
ensued.  She had 12 delinquent debts totaling about $12,500.<A HREF="05-13725.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">  She has received credit counseling and has paid off six of the 12 creditors, with a formal plan to pay the rest per

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">On January 8, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">On March 2, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to me on April 11, 2006.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 28, 2006 and the hearing was held on June 2, 2006.  The Government offered six (6) exhibits 
(Government Exhibits (GX) 1-6).  Applicant offered four exhibits (Applicants Exhibits (AX) A-D).  Applicant also submitted sixteen (16) timely post hearing exhibits (AX E1-E16).  
The transcript was received at DOHA on June 13, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant is a 44-year-old web developer for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains thirteen (13) allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant admits 12 of 
the 13 allegations, all except for 1.k., which she denies. She adds comments and explanations.  All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">After considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><STRONG><EM>Guideline F (Financial) </EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant has a history of delinquent debts.  As of the issuance of the SOR on January 9, 2006,  Applicant owed the following past due debts (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">delinquent, charged off, referred for 
collection, or reduced to judgment) to the following creditors in the approximate amounts cited:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.a. - Bank A --------------------$327.00.  This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.b. - Telephone Company B -- $54.00.  This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.c. - Company C ---------------$110.00.  This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.d. - Health Agency D ----------$64.00.  This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.e. - Veterinary Clinic E ------$125.00.  This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.f. - Bank F -------------------$1,852.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.g. - Company G -------------$3,382.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.h. - Bank H ----------------- $2,207.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.i. - Bank I --------------------$1,791.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.j. - Bank J --------------------$1,586,00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.k. - Loan Company K---------$878.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.l. - Baseball Team L ----------$128.00.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">This debt has been paid off.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.m. - Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien for $62,015.39 -filed July 30, 1999, and released on October 27, 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant has received financial counseling from a consumer credit counseling service, has paid off six of the creditors, and is in the process of resolving the remaining delinquent 
debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant is strongly supported by her supervisors. Her Program Manager has known her since 1997 and has found her work to be superior, even during the difficult period of her 
divorce (AX A).  Her immediate supervisor calls her an "exemplary"employee who "complies with all rules and regulations," and has had "no security violations" (AX B).  Her 
performance has led to yearly raises of 7%, 6% and 6.9%, which "has helped her meet her financial commitments"(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM>Id.</EM>).  Her brother, an Air Force Major, attests to Applicant's 
financial problems with her husband during her divorce, her efforts to care for her children, and to repair her credit.  He states that her character is such as to preclude any improper 
conduct on her part and that her financial position continues to improve (AX C).  Her current salary is $2,372.42 gross and $1,727.56 net every two weeks (AX D).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually 
and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate 
question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the 
Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within 
specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as 
amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation's 
security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant is a 44-year-old web developer.  In her response to the SOR, she admitted all of the allegations, but one, which she subsequently admitted.  She provided explanations for 
the circumstances of each debt, and has provided supporting documentation at the hearing and in timely post hearing documents.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant testified that none of the debts alleged in the SOR had been incurred recently, but came from the period of her marriage (Tr at 18).  She has recently made significant 
movements toward financial rehabilitation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.a. and 1.b. - As cited below, these debts have been paid off. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.c., 1.d.,  - These were debts her ex-husband was supposed to pay, by general agreement, but not specifically named in the divorce decree, which was finalized in June 2001. (Id.).  
As cited below, these debts have been paid off. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.e. - This $125 debt was to a veterinarian, with whom she discussed the amount of the charges for her pet.  As cited below, this debt has been paid off. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.f. - She made some payments on this bank credit card debt, but the stopped because of a lack of funds.  She is now receiving financial counseling and has contacted the three major 
credit reporting  services with the aim of resolving the amounts due on the still outstanding debts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k. - She is now receiving financial counseling and has contacted the three major credit reporting  services with the aim of resolving and paying the amounts 
due on the still outstanding debts (AX E2, E3, and E4).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.l. - Applicant has paid off this debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">1.m. - Applicant asked the IRS to file the tax lien during the divorce because she was concerned her husband would take the proceeds from the sale of the family home and leave her 
at least partially stuck with a tax lien (Tr at 24).  The lien was released in October 1999, some four months after it was originally filed. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In summary, as of the end of the hearing, the debts alleged in SOR 1.a.- 1.l were still substantially unpaid or otherwise unresolved.  However, Applicant did submit a package of post 
hearing documentation (AX E).  She has now spoken with a credit counselor, who has advised her as to how to resolve her delinquent debts and to correct reporting errors (AX E1)..  
The documents include letters to the three major credit reporting services (AX E2, AX E3, and AX E4).  She has also submitted copies of correspondence and bank checks, showing 
payments in full to the creditors cited in SOR 1.a. ($327); 1.b. ($54); 1.c. ($110); 1.d. ($64); 1.e.($`125); and 1.l. ($128).  The debts alleged in SOR 1.f. ($1,852); 1.g. ($3,382) and 
1.h. and 1.i. ($2,207 and $1,791); 1.j. ($1,586); and 1.k. ($878) remain unresolved as of the closing of the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant states that "credit card amounts that were sold should reflect a zero balance" and that this would "substantially reduce my total debt by almost half" (AX E1).  It is not 
uncommon in DOHA cases involving financial issues for credit reports to cite the same debt under both the original creditor and a collection agency to which it was sold.  This issue 
should be resolved by her communications with the credit reporting services.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Letters to the credit reporting agencies were written on June 12, 2006, some 10 days after the hearing.  The package of documents she submitted to DOHA by fax on July 3, 2006 
does not contain any responses from the credit reporting companies.  However, the documents show that Applicant paid off six of the smaller debts, totaling about $808.  I have 
evaluated the favorable letters submitted by Applicant.  The writers were all aware of  Applicant's divorce and financial situation and attest to her positive character and judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Applicant could certainly have moved faster, but after a review of the entire record, I conclude that Applicant has learned the hard financial lessons and has established financial 
rehabilitation to the degree that she can safely be relied upon to exercise the financial judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required by anyone seeking access to the nation's 
secrets.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors: E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; E2.2.1.2. 
The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; E2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct; E2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity 
at the time of the conduct; E2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation; E2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM> </EM>rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; E2.2.1.7. The 
motivation for the conduct; E2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and E2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">.  I have considered all 
nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.  Viewing Applicant's financial conduct  under the Whole Person concept, I conclude that Applicant can 
be relied upon to safeguard classified information, as she has done in the past.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions - </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained 
affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM>Disqualifying Conditions</EM>: E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations; and E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM>Mitigating Conditions: 
</EM>E2.A6.1.3.3. Applicant's financial problems were largely due to matters beyond her control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce or separation).  Under E2.A6.1.3.6. Applicant has  recently initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts and has paid off six of her 
12 creditors, albeit the smaller ones.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I conclude Applicant has demonstrated substantial rehabilitation and can be relied upon to continue her efforts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In summary, I conclude she possesses the good judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets. </SPAN></P>
