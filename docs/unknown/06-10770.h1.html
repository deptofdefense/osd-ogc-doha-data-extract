<P>Applicant is a 24-year-old claims processor who has worked for the same Defense contractor since November 2004. Between the ages of 16 and 20, she was arrested for nine minor incidents. She 
only noted the most egregious event on her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions because she did not think the other incidents she could recall were applicable. Since reaching the age of 21, she 
has had a clean record, returned to finish her secondary education, maintained full-time employment, become engaged, and had a baby.  Applicant has shown that neither her personal nor criminal 
conduct poses an unacceptable risk. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 27, 2006,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary determination that Applicant was 
not eligible for assignment to information systems positions designated ADP I/II/III.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). 
Specifically, it alleges that Applicant was arrested on nine separate occasions between 1998 and 2002, and that she deliberately failed to disclose eight of those arrests on a Questionnaire For Public 
Trust Positions (SF-85P).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notarized, but undated, Answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 20, 2006. In that answer, </SPAN>Applicant admitted all the criminal conduct allegations. She also admitted, with explanation, 
the sole allegation raised regarding personal conduct. Because she failed to indicate whether she wished to have either a hearing or a decision based only on the record, Applicant was asked to 
indicate her preference and resign her answer. She stated, in her response received on August 7, 2006, that she did not wish to have a hearing.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> On August 18, 2006, the government submitted its 
FORM, containing its argument and seven supporting items. Applicant received the FORM on August 31, 2006, but declined to respond to the government's argument and supporting items within 
the 30-day period provided. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to all the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful  review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 24-year-old claims processor who has worked for the same Defense contractor since November 2004. By the time she completed her Questionnaire For Public Trust Position (SF-86P) 
on November 28, 2004, she had returned to school to finish her high school education and started working in her present position. Between the time she turned 18 years old and the time she 
assumed her current employment, she had approximately seven short term jobs; she was fired from two of those jobs<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> for using too many sick days. She is currently engaged to be married and has a 
two-year-old daughter.</P> 
 
<P>The facts of record are scant and Applicant has offered little information in her answer to the SOR as background to the facts at issue. Both the SOR and her admissions indicate she has been 
arrested nine times. She was first arrested on December 3, 1998, at the age of 16, then charged and found guilty of Habitual Truancy. The following year, when she was 17 years old, she choked her 
mother's boyfriend's son when she caught him inappropriately touching her four-year-old sister in a sexual manner; the boy's father called the police. She was arrested on September 20, 1999, 
charged with Child Abuse - Recklessly Causing Harm, and issued a ticket. </P> 
 
<P>Shortly after Applicant's 18th birthday, on New Year's Eve in 1999, a neighbor called the police to complain about a party she was hosting. When the officers arrived, she was arrested and charged 
for Underage Possession/Consumption of Alcohol. When marijuana seeds were discovered in one of the ashtrays on the premises, she was also arrested and charged for Possession of THC 
(tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive substance present in marijuana. Two months later, on February 2, 2000, she stole a packet of cigarettes from a store. She was arrested and charged with 
Retail Theft. Eventually, Applicant was found guilty and fined $91.50.</P> 
 
<P>On March 15, 2001,<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant again hosted a raucous party and the police were summoned. She was arrested and charged with Underage Drinking - Possession of Alcohol. Ultimately, she was 
found guilty and fined $74.00. She was again arrested on May 23, 2001, and charged with Underage Alcohol Violation. Applicant does not remember the facts surrounding this incident, but 
suggests she was issued a ticket for the act.</P> 
 
<P>On or about July 22, 2001, Applicant and her younger, but physically larger, brother got into a fight. Their mother called the police after Applicant left. Because she was 19 years old and her brother 
was 16 years of age at the time, Applicant was arrested and charged with Child Abuse - Intentionally Causing Child Abuse (Felony) and Disorderly Conduct. Eventually, the charge was reduced and 
she was only fined $119.75.</P> 
 
<P>At the age of 20, Applicant dated a man with emotional problems and who lived with his parents. After locking himself in the bathroom and threatening suicide, his mother asked Applicant to come 
to their house and intercede. Applicant's mother called the police. The man or someone in his family told the police that the 5' 2" Applicant had broken down the bathroom door, although it was the 
man's cousin who had broken the door. She was arrested on April 30, 2002, and charged with Disorderly Conduct, for which she was found guilty and fined $122.50.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's last cited criminal incident occurred on October 28, 2002. After being pulled over for speeding, it was discovered that when she failed to timely pay a prior ticket, her driver's license 
had been revoked. She was arrested and charged with Operating after Revocation. Eventually, she was found guilty and fined $125.00.</P> 
 
<P>On November 28, 2004, Applicant executed an SF-86P. She answered "yes" to "<STRONG>Question 20. Your Police Record </STRONG> In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any 
offense(s)" She provided one incident, which is nearly illegible on the copy provided. The government states in its FORM without contradiction that the entry pertains to her 2001 fight with her 
brother. When she completed her SF-86P, she did not remember some of the incidents, and was not aware she had to list alcohol-related incidents for which she received a ticket.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has had no other incidents of a criminal nature in over four years and no such incidents since turning 21 years of age in December 2002. She states that she has turned her life around. She 
is now 24 years old, engaged, and the mother of a two-year-old child. She has held her current position for two years.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation. "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.</P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Each eligibility 
determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonplace decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In security clearance cases, 
the Government initially must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [her] security clearance."<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be 
resolved in favor of the national security."<A HREF="06-10770.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
<P> The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to sensitive positions.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has presented a case for disqualification under both Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct). For clarity, I will discuss each separately.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Criminal Conduct</EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA determined that Applicant was not eligible for assignment to information systems positions designated ADP I/II/III based on her nine instances of criminal conduct.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct raises a 
security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Here, Applicant admits that she was arrested on nine 
occasions and found guilty of most of the charges raised. Consequently, both Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 1 (<EM>any conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged</EM>) and CC DC 2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The incidents at issue occurred between December 1998, when Applicant was 16 years of age, and October 2002, when she was 20 years old. Because they are multiple in number, Criminal 
Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 2 (<EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>) cannot apply. Since the last incident, however, over four years have passed. Given the passage of four years since the 
last incident, and in light of the fact that the majority of incidents occurred over five years ago when she was still a teenager, CC MC 1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the record discloses few supplemental facts to complement Applicant's brief comments on each allegation, it cannot be determined whether CC MC 3 (<EM>the person was pressured or coerced 
into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life</EM>) or CC MC 4 (<EM>the person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not 
likely to recur</EM>) applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not had another criminal incident in over four years and none has occurred since she turned 21 years of age. She states that she has turned her life around, and the facts support her. 
She is no longer a single teenager or 20-year-old throwing loud parties or getting into fights. She is on the verge of her 25th birthday. She no longer goes from one short term job to another; instead, 
she has responsibly held her present position for two years. She has returned to school and is working toward her high school diploma. She is engaged to be married and the mother of a two-year-old 
daughter. The record shows that she has matured considerably and is no longer engaging in the petty criminal acts that highlighted her youth. Based on the significant turnaround that has transpired 
in her life since reaching her 21st birthday, CC MC 5 (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) applies. For the same reasons, and in light of the length of time since her last criminal act, 
she has mitigated criminal conduct security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under the applicable Regulation, personal conduct is a major concern because it asks whether a person's past conduct justifies confidence that the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information. Personal conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The Regulation sets out certain conditions relating to personal conduct that could raise security concerns.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Here, the SOR states that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on her SF-85P by not listing all of her arrests in response to Question 20. She admits her answer was incomplete, but denies 
she deliberately tried to falsify or conceal information. Rather, she did not remember some of the incidents, and did not think "drinking tickets" were to be listed in response to the question as it was 
worded. Indeed, she did note the most serious incident, Intentionally Causing Child Abuse (Felony) that was eventually reduced. Given her interpretation, it is reasonable to conclude she did not 
purposefully falsify or conceal the other, minor and comparatively mundane, infractions.  Moreover, there is no evidence that her failure to add that laundry list of youthful offenses was done with 
the express intent to falsify material facts. Absent that intent, a disqualifying condition under  Guideline E cannot be sustained.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered Applicant under the "whole person" concept based on the evidence in the record before me. She is a maturing young woman who had a reckless girlhood, during which she was 
arrested for a number of relatively minor incidents. Two of those incidents occurred before she reached the age of majority, and all the charges occurred before she turned 21 years of age in 
December 2002. None of the crimes cited are particularly grievous and none are much more than examples of youthful indiscretion. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More important is the woman she is today, for that is the bellwether as to the security concerns raised. Rather than abandon her education, Applicant has returned to school to finish high school. 
Instead, she abandoned her practice of moving between short term jobs and has started a stable career with her current employer, where she has worked without interruption for two years. She has 
become a mother and is currently engaged to be married. Soon to turn 25 years old, she has not had a criminal incident since her driving infraction when she was 20 years of age. Taken together, it 
is apparent that Applicant has matured considerably in the past four years, and grown from being a miscreant youth to being a responsible working adult and mother. Most importantly, the progress 
she has made and the woman she is today does not raise security concerns regarding her present judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Given all the facts, explanations, and considerations, 
Applicant does not pose an unacceptable security risk based on either her criminal or personal conduct. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant is entitled to a favorable eligibility determination.</SPAN></P>
