<P>Applicant is a Certified Public Accountant employed as an auditor for a defense contractor.  He came to the United States from Nigeria in 1982 to study and 
became a United States citizen in 1991.  His mother is a permanent resident alien of the United States but a citizen of Nigeria.  She went to Nigeria for a visit in 
2004 but became so ill so has been unable to travel back to the United States.  She is presently residing in Nigeria with Applicant's sister, a citizen and resident 
of Nigeria.  His mother and sister are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Applicant's in-laws are citizens of and reside in Nigeria.  His father-in-law is an official with an international organization and the in-laws are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 6, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 27, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 1, 2004.  He admitted all of the allegations under Guidelines B.  He initially elected to have the matter decided 
on the written record in lieu of a hearing and Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on September 22, 2004.  Applicant received a 
complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 27, 2004, and provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  He acknowledged receipt of the FORM on October 20, 2004.  Applicant responded to the FORM on November 3, 2004, 
and denied three and admitted two of the allegations under Guideline B.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The request for hearing was 
received by DOHA on November 3, 2004 and the case was assigned to me on November 23, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case 
on December 2, 2004, and a notice of hearing was issued on December 3, 2004.  The hearing was held on January 5, 2005.  Six government exhibits, one 
Applicant exhibit, the testimony of the Applicant, and one Applicant witness were received during the hearing.  The transcript was received on January 11, 
2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old Certified Public Accountant employed as an auditor for a defense contractor.  Applicant was born in Nigeria and came to the United 
States as a student in 1982.  He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from United States universities and licensed as a Certified Public Accountant in 
1994.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1991.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant was granted a security clearance by another government department in 1999.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has 
been married to his present wife for six years and they have two young children who are native born United States citizens.  His wife became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 2004 and is employed as a civilian employee of a Department of Defense agency.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  His first wife is a United States citizen and they had 
a daughter who is a United States citizen.  His second wife was from Nigeria.  He has no contact with her but believes she is a now a United States citizen.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother is 84-years-old and a Nigerian citizen presently residing with Applicant's sister in Nigeria.  She came to the United States five years ago and 
is a permanent resident alien.  When in the United States, she lives with Applicant and his family.  While on a visit to Nigeria in early 2004, his mother had a 
stroke and by doctor's orders is unable to travel to return to the United States.  She is currently residing in Nigeria because of her medical condition.  She will 
return to the United States when her medical condition permits.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's sister works for a bank in a large Nigerian commercial city and is a citizen and resident of Nigeria.  His sister's husband works for a bank in Nigeria 
and their two children are students at universities in the United States.  This sister came to the United States approximately a year ago to visit her siblings and 
children.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has two sister's in the United States; one a United States citizen, and the other a permanent resident alien.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He is not sure when the sister who is a 
permanent resident alien was last in Nigeria.  However, his sister who is the United States citizen visited Nigeria in January 2004 with Applicant when their 
mother became ill.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife's mother and father are citizens of Nigeria and reside in Nigeria.  The mother is at home and the father is a project manager for an 
international organization.  Applicant's wife has five siblings, two reside in Nigeria, two reside in England, and one in the United States.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has made four trips to Nigeria since 1997.  The first three were for pleasure.  The fourth trip in January 2004 was with his sister to visit their sick 
mother.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He talks to his sister or mother in Nigeria approximately once a month.  He has sent about $6,000 to his mother to help pay her medical costs in 
Nigeria.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His wife also talks to her parents in Nigeria about once a month.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  None of Applicant's family in Nigeria are employees or agents of Nigeria.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  
Applicant and his family are close and they all care about their mother.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Areas of Nigeria are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflicts between religious, political, and ethnic factions.  The areas in which 
Applicant's mother, sister, and in-laws reside are predominantly Christian and not identified by the U.S. State Department as areas where outbreaks of violence 
have recently occurred.  There is considerable risks to traveling in Nigeria because of violent crimes, religious tensions, and terrorism.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  The government's 
human rights record is poor and the government continues to commit serious human rights abuses.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  There have been  improved and strong ties between 
Nigeria and the United State since June 1998.  Bilateral relationships have continued to improve and there is good cooperation on many important foreign 
policy goals.  The Nigerian government has lent strong support to the United States government's counter-terrorism efforts since September 11, 2001.  Nigeria 
has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in Sub-Saharan Africa.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence Nigeria has exploited its citizens to 
obtain classified information from United States citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a security concern exists when an individual's immediate family and other persons whom the Applicant may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries are also relevant to security determinations if 
they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercions, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition that applies to 
Applicant is Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.2 (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, 
or resident or present in a foreign country</EM>).  An immediate family member includes spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, or sisters.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant's 
mother and sister in Nigeria are citizens of and resident in a foreign country and fall within the disqualifying condition.  Applicant's sister in the United States 
who is a permanent resident alien but a citizen of Nigeria falls within the disqualifying condition.  His in-laws are not immediate family members but there is a 
rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Applicant's in-laws fall 
within the disqualifying condition.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  I conclude the disqualifying condition has been established as to the mother, sister in Nigeria, the permanent resident alien 
sister and the mother-in-law and the father-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition that applies is Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s) are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States).  </EM>Applicant must establish that the people falling within the disqualifying condition are not agents of a foreign power and not in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way to force Applicant to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.<A HREF="03-14086.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  None of 
Applicant's family are agents of a foreign power.  The sister that is a Nigerian citizen but residing in the United States is not in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power.  Applicant's mother is elderly and sick and the chances of exploitation minimal.  In addition, as soon as she is able to travel, she will return to 
the United States and any potential security concern will decrease.  The possibility of exploitation of Applicant's sister in Nigeria is also minimal.  She is a 
banker working in a large commercial city in Nigeria.  Applicant's father-in-law, because of his position with the international organization, and the mother in-laws are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  While there is political, religious, and criminal unrest in Nigeria, it is not in the areas where 
Applicant's mother, sister, and in-laws reside.  Nigeria has good relations with the United States and the possibility they would try to exploit the family 
members of an United States citizen is highly unlikely.  Applicant has been in the United States for over 20 years, almost all his adult life.  He has been a 
United States citizen for over 10 years.  His family ties and bonds are stronger but so is his ties to the United States.  The possibility of Applicant being forced 
by exploitation of a foreign power to chose between his loyalty to a person or loyalty to the United States is very minimal.  I conclude the family members are 
not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to the family members involved and the 
United States.  Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept for a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  I conclude the Applicant 
is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
