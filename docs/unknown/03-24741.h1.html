</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 22, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  By letter of January 24, 2005, Applicant responded to 
the SOR.  He admitted to four allegations, denied two allegations, and provided one non-answer in response to the seven allegations noted under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and he only offered explanatory comments with regard to the two allegations set forth under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I was assigned this case on April 22, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 4, 2005, advising the parties that a hearing would be conducted on May 25, 
2005.  At the hearing, Applicant introduced one exhibit and the Government introduced seven exhibits.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I received the transcript on June 7, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has denied only two of the allegations set forth under Guidelines F and E.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I 
make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 26-year-old single male.  He is currently employed by a defense contractor as a tool room attendant.  Applicant served in the military from 1998 
until the summer of 2001, during which time he accumulated approximately $446 in retail credit  debt.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  That June, however, he was administratively processed 
and eventually given a general discharge; this level of discharge apparently created an overpayment to Applicant for which he was held liable.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Upon review, 
the general discharge was upgraded to an honorable discharge.  Approximately two months later, he started a job in retail management.  One year later, in 
October 2002, he left retail to assume his present position.  Applicant currently earns approximately $40,000 per year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's girlfriend gave birth to their daughter in February 2002.  Their relationship soon became strained, however, both mother and child moved a few 
hours away to another state.  Pursuant to court order, Applicant has provided varying degrees of child support over the years.  This support is garnished from his 
regular paychecks.  As the child's primary financial provider, Applicant has also volunteered to pay other expenses beyond that support, generally prioritizing 
his contributions toward his daughter over his commitment to his own past and current debts.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He also maintains rights which permit him to visit her every 
other weekend.  These visits require that  Applicant drive out of state to pick up his daughter, return to his own home for an overnight visit, return the child to 
her mother at the end of the weekend, and drive himself back home.  This regimen leaves Applicant with little free time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, in November 2002, Applicant's car was repossessed and sold.  This left him indebted to his car dealer's financial division for approximately $9,343.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
Also around that time, he incurred a debt for $191 to his cell phone provider, although that account was subsequently made current.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 19, 2002, Applicant filled out and certified his application for security clearance (SF-86).  He answered "no" to the standard financial questions 
on that form; this included his answers related to whether he was currently more than 90 days delinquent, or ever had been over 180 days delinquent in the prior 
seven years, on any debts.  At that time, however, he was clearly aware that his car was in the process of being repossessed.  He was also aware of his debts 
existent as of June 2001 (the credit debt of $446 and the disputed $4,010) and of the fact that he had made no significant efforts toward their satisfaction.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2003, Applicant attempted to convince his former girlfriend and their daughter to move back to his state by renting a more expensive apartment for them to 
share.  Although the new apartment failed as an inducement, the increased rent eventually forced Applicant to vacate prior to the end of the lease.  This 
premature move cause Applicant to incur a debt equal to one month's rent plus penalties.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  That October, he financed a car purchase through his uncle, thus 
giving him a reliable form of transport to visit his daughter and to go to work.  Payments on this replacement car should be completed this year. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 24, 2004, Applicant was injured in a serious traffic accident.  His condition and his appointment schedule foiled his attempt to find a second job.  
Indeed, Applicant's injuries were sufficiently extensive to necessitate extensive care, physical therapy, and numerous appointments through April 2005.  
Because he was not at fault in the accident, the other driver was found to be liable for Applicant's medical costs.  Accident related bills are usually sent directly 
or forwarded to that other driver.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant anticipates receiving a settlement in this matter for approximately $13,000, and he has been told that he should 
receive those funds in the latter half of 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In sum, the debts cited in the SOR are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.a </STRONG>- A debt to a military exchange account in the approximate amount of $446, for an account charged off as a bad debt in July 2001.  Applicant admits this 
debt. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.b</STRONG> - A debt to a military finance and accounting service in the approximate amount of $4,010 for an account charged off to bad debt in about January 2002.  
Neither party can characterize this debt other than to acknowledge that it arose from the time he was given a general discharge and speculate that it is related to 
an incentive or bonus for which he would become liable if he received a less than honorable discharge.  Applicant admits this debt arose, but believes it is no 
longer his obligation, given the upgrade of his discharge from general to honorable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.c</STRONG> - A debt to an automobile financial service in the approximate amount of $9,343, the balance owed after the repossession and resale of Applicant's car in 
about November 2002.  Applicant admits to this debt. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.d</STRONG> - A debt to a cell phone carrier in the amount of $191, for an account opened in December 2000 and placed for collection prior to December 2002.  
Applicant has demonstrated that this debt was paid.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.e </STRONG>- A debt to an agency representing an apartment complex in the amount of $1,484, since about 2003.  Applicant admits this debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.f </STRONG>- A debt to a collection agency in the approximate amount of $206 for an account placed for collection in about February 2004.  In his response to the SOR, 
Applicant claimed he could not identify this debt.  At the hearing, the Government identified the debt as a 2004 medical bill, apparently arising from 
Applicant's 2004 traffic accident..</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits he has difficulty paying his bills.  He nets approximately $1,600 per month after his child support is deducted.  Applicant is then left with less 
than $400 per month for food, child visitation expenditures, bills, and extraneous expenses after paying $600 for rent and utilities, $300 in current car payments, 
and $125 for his cell phone, plus babysitting, commuting, and insurance.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He now has an account with a state job center to search part-time job listings and 
has recently sought to modify his work schedule so that he might pursue a second job in the daytime. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it should be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>The concern</EM>:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG><EM>The concern</EM>:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits that he has debts dating back to at least 2001 
for which he either has yet to make payment or has been unable to keep current.  This fact raises both security concerns and Financial Consideration 
Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 ([<EM>i</EM>]<EM>nability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>).  Moreover, his failure to truthfully disclose that he had delinquencies in excess of both 90 and 180 days on his security clearance application raises 
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.1.2 [<EM>r</EM>]<EM>efusal to complete required security forms, releases, or provide full, frank, and truthful 
answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness 
determination</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Government's initial burden has been met and disqualifying conditions raised, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  This may include raising certain mitigating conditions 
set forth in the guidelines.  Ultimately, however, it becomes Applicant's burden to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a 
security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, Applicant admits that the debts at issue have gone unpaid either because he was short of funds or because he chose to apply available funds elsewhere (<EM>ie. 
</EM>extras for his daughter and her upkeep, a larger apartment, a replacement car, etc.).  Indeed, he has demonstrated both an inability and an unwillingness to meet 
his financial obligations and prioritize his debts which date back to at least June 2001 and has continued into the present.  Therefore, neither Financial 
Consideration Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he behavior was not recent</EM>) nor FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 ([<EM>i</EM>]<EM>t was an isolated incident</EM>) applies.  
Applicant also chose to decline financial counseling owing to the cost of such services, making FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) inapplicable.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has, however, presented some explanatory or mitigating  facts.  He has shown that his net income, after expenses, is far lower than that portrayed in 
the SOR, thus clarifying his true financial situation.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has demonstrated a good faith effort to resolve the issue as to whether, given the upgrade of his 
discharge from general to honorable, he is still liable for the debt cited as debt 1.b in the SOR; he has successfully solicited one of his State's U.S. Senators to 
intercede on his behalf in order to clarify that issue on his behalf.  Moreover, he has paid his past due balance on his cell phone bill and kept the account cited at 
debt 1.d of the SOR current.  Furthermore, he has adequately demonstrated that the inclusion of the medical bill noted as debt 1.f on the SOR was in error, and 
that it should have been forwarded for payment by the party responsible for his accident or their insurer.  Therefore, I find that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies with regard to those allegations cited in the SOR at 1.b, 
1.d, and 1.f.   Consequentially, I also find subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes his accumulation of the debts at issue to his 2001 military discharge,  the February 2002 birth of his child, and his January 2004 accident.  
This argument fails for three reasons.  First, the beginning of his debt problem predates his military discharge and he was fully employed again by the time his 
next debts occurred.  Second, childbirth is not an "unexpected medical emergency," as contemplated by the Directive.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Third, as costly as his unfortunate 2004 
accident may have been with regard to physical pain and time lost for appointments, he was not liable for the financial costs the accident precipitated.  
Consequentially, none of these three events can be said to have caused his debt, although it is undeniable they may have had some impact on their timely 
repayment.  Because none of his debts have a nexus with a qualifying incident under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4, ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation</EM>), I find it 
does not apply.  No other mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant understands, and understood at the time he completed his SF 86 application, that he possesses the obligations cited.  Given his testimony and 
demeanor at the hearing, however, I do not find that his simultaneous denial of delinquencies on that application necessarily indicates that he committed a 
deliberate act of falsification.  Rather, based on his highly credible testimony, I find that those denials were simply the result of an utter lack of financial 
sophistication and a limited understanding of the terms used.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  While this degree of na&iuml;vet&eacute; may raise other concerns, it does not rise to the level of conscious 
deception.  Therefore, I find paragraph 2 regarding Guideline E (Personal Conduct) in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also examined both the record and the Applicant in view of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a well mannered young man with admirable 
intentions regarding his role as a young, single father.  Moreover, while it is clear he possesses little financial savvy, his desire to satisfy his debts seems 
genuine.  As the DOHA Appeal Board has determined, however, even good people can pose security risks.<A HREF="03-24741.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Because Applicant has failed in his burden to 
mitigate the security concerns that his finances raise, I find for the Government with regard to paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. of the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
