<P>Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a decision, dated November 7, 2001, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether Applicant was denied effective assistance of counsel during the proceedings below; 
and (2) whether Applicant can be granted a security clearance on a probationary basis with certain conditions.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 26, 2001.  The SOR was based on 
Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  A hearing was held on October 11, 2001.  The Administrative Judge issued 
a written decision, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  
The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and 
identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact 
are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's 
findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR 
Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied effective assistance of counsel during the proceedings below</SPAN>.  During the proceedings below, Applicant was 
represented by a lawyer who is different from the lawyer representing him on appeal.  Applicant contends he was denied adequate representation 
during the proceedings below.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues his hearing lawyer failed to address the government's security 
concerns by focusing on the issue of whether Applicant's conduct was criminal in nature even though the SOR did not allege Applicant's conduct 
was criminal.  Applicant further asks the Board to consider the facts in evidence as outlined in his appeal submission.</P> 
 
<P>As noted in the Scope of Review section of this decision, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Therefore, the Board will not conduct an 
independent evaluation of the record evidence to make its own findings about Applicant's case.  Because Applicant does not challenge the 
Administrative Judge's findings of fact, those findings of fact stand for purposes of this appeal.</P> 
 
<P>DOHA proceedings are civil in nature.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0519 (December 7, 2001) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (February 8, 
2001) at p. 7.  Accordingly, technical legal defenses that may be appropriate to raise in a criminal prosecution are out of place in industrial security 
clearance adjudications.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0382 (May 3, 2000) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 98-0529 (June 15, 1999) at p. 2; ISCR 
Case No. 97-0184 (June 16, 1998) at p. 2.  Although a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may be an appropriate defense in a criminal 
case, it is not an appropriate defense to raise in these proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0515 (March 23, 1999) at p. 3; ISCR Case 
No. 96-0127 (July 29, 1997) at p. 2.  The actions and inactions of Applicant's hearing lawyer during the proceedings below do not provide a 
basis for the Board to conclude that the Administrative Judge's decision should be reversed or remanded.  In short, Applicant's remedy for this 
claim, if any, would be in another forum.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted a security clearance on a probationary basis with certain conditions</SPAN>.  Applicant asks the Board to place him 
"on a probationary status": (a) pending Applicant's reinstatement with a therapist who does not argue that Appellant's sexual behavior is "okay"; (b) 
with Applicant showing proof of enrollment in such therapy; and (c) with any problems Applicant has during therapy being reported to the security 
director of his company.  Applicant seeks relief that cannot be granted.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0109 (March 1, 2000) at pp. 3-4 (citing 
earlier Board decisions).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
