<P>Applicant accumulated substantial debt while in the U.S. Army.  After being ordered to get financial counseling, Applicant put a financial plan into effect that 
seemed to produce results.  When he separated from the Army, Applicant still had outstanding debts of about $7,000.  He could not find a civilian job that 
allowed him to continue making payments to his creditors.  Applicant continued to make poor financial choices by purchasing vehicles he could not afford.  He 
filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after receiving the SOR.  Applicant failed to demonstrate that his financial problems are under control.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 29 September 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-09209.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 8 October 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 27 
January 2004.  On 1 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 11 March 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a 28-year-old internal communications center operator for a defense contractor.  He entered the U.S. Army in 1995 and was honorably discharged 
1999.  He married in 1998 and has one child.  He is currently facing substantial financial difficulties because of medical costs incurred because of Applicant's 
ulcer and kidney stones and his son's chronic ear infections.  Tr. 35.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">While he was in the Army, Applicant became financially overextended by charging more purchases on his credit cards than he could afford to pay at the end of 
each month.  Applicant's first sergeant discovered the financial difficulties and convinced Applicant to enroll in credit counseling at his military installation.  
With the counselors' assistance, Applicant set up a financial plan and began paying his debts.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">When he left the Army in 1999, Applicant was still approximately $7,000 in debt.  He was unable to find employment that would permit him to continue 
payments on his financial plan.  His financial problems were exacerbated when he and his wife purchased a second car.  After two months, they were forced to 
turn the car back to the dealer because they were unable to make the payments.  They still owe $4,500 on this car.  Ex. A at 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In 2003, Applicant traded his truck in for a newer automobile.  The payments were almost $400 per month.  The vehicle was repossessed in May 2003.  Ex. A 
at 5.  Applicant and his wife now own two older vehicles.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on 10 December 2003 claiming liabilities of over $66,000 and assets of $3,500.<A HREF="02-09209.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>Applicant no longer uses 
credit cards.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had 16 delinquent debts totaling over $12,000 (&para;&para; 1.a. - 1.p.) and he has been unable or unwilling to satisfy his 
delinquent debts (&para; 1.q.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the delinquent debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.a. - 1.p.  Applicant has a history of 
not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy these debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Although Applicant appeared to be 
on the road to financial recovery, once he separated from the Army, his financial situation deteriorated.  He could not find adequate employment to keep paying 
on his debt plan, he made injudicious purchases of vehicles, and he had higher medical expenses than he anticipated. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's case raises two mitigating conditions:  (1)  The applicant received counseling and there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is 
under control (MC E2.A6.1.3.4.); and (2) the applicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve the debts (MC E2.A6.1.3.6.).  Applicant received financial 
counseling in the Army and made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  He managed to reduce his debt to $7,000.  But once he separated from the service, he 
stopped paying on the plan.  It appears he took no further action to resolve these debts until after the SOR was issued.  Applicant's financial situation is still 
unsettled.  Applicant's debts have not been discharged, yet.  Although Applicant destroyed his credit cards and has purchased more affordable motor vehicles, 
he admits he is still not comfortable handling his financial matters.  While I have no doubt Applicant is a loyal American citizen, as he states, Applicant has not 
sufficiently resolved the financial security concerns raised in the SOR.  I find against Applicant on &para;&para; 1.a.-1.p.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In &para; 1.q. of the SOR, DOHA alleged a disqualifying condition without alleging any facts.  Therefore, I find for Applicant on &para; 1.q.</SPAN></P>
