<P>Applicant's drug use, criminal conduct, and personal conduct raise security concerns as she used illegal drugs extensively from 1994 until 1999; and she 
continued to use illegal drugs (Ecstasy) to 2001, two years after she joined the staff of a defense contractor.  She continued illegal drug use even after she had 
been denied a security clearance in 1999 and was on notice that illegal drug use is against the government's security policies.  While she declared she has 
changed her lifestyle and stopped her extensive use of many illegal drugs in 1999, she failed to mitigate her more recent use of Ecstasy.  She failed to 
demonstrate clearly her intent to avoid all drug use in the future.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on August 8, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-18279.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug use (Guideline H), personal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). 
Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on September 15, 2003, where she admitted all of the allegations and requested a 
decision without a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel on November 25, 2003, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and advised Applicant that she had 30 days from receipt of the letter 
to respond.  Applicant received the FORM on January 6, 2004, but failed to provide any response.  On March 8, 2004, the case was assigned to me. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 29 years old, has worked for a defense contractor from 1999 to present.  Applicant completed a security form (SF 86) in March 2002 where she 
disclosed the U.S. Air Force denied her a security clearance in October 1999.  (Exhibit 4)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant attended a university from received a B.A. degree in 1999.  She married in October 1999.  (Exhibit 4)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has an extensive history of drug use:  marijuana from 1994 to 1999, LSD from 1995 to 1996, cocaine from 1995 to 1998.  Also she ingested an 
animal tranquilizer in 1995 and abused Valium in 1996.  She also used methamphetamines ('speed") in 1995 and heroin in 1995.  Also, she began using the 
illegal drug Ecstasy in 1995; she continued using this drug until 2001, two years after she had been denied a security clearance.  (Exhibits 3, 4)</P> 
 
<P>In September 2003 Applicant stated that she has changed her life-style after she married and has purchased a home; she has two dogs, new hobbies and 
interests.  Her career is "headed in a positive direction."  (Exhibit 3 )</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[First]  Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[Second] Inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse<A HREF="02-18279.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (see above definition); </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant then needs to present evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may 
be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's extensive illegal drug use  from 1994 to at least  2001.  Applicant continued to use Ecstasy 
from 1995 to 2001, two years after she had been denied a security clearance by the Air Force and after she went to work for a defense contractor.  Her wide-ranging drug use and misconduct raises questions about her judgment overall, especially when she continued to use drugs even after her security clearance 
denial in 1999 put her on notice of government policies and laws against drug use.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, she stated she has changed her life-style since she married in 1999, but provided no evidence other than her own statement to establish this 
change.  Given the five year passage of time since her earlier drug use, Applicant has mitigated<A HREF="02-18279.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> concerns over her earlier illegal use of marijuana, LSD, 
cocaine, Valium, animal tranquilizer, speed, and heroin which ended in 1999.  However, since she continued her illegal use of Ecstacy until 2001, her choice to 
continue drug use is too recent to mitigate.  Further she failed to make a statement that she does not intend to abuse drugs in the future and showed questionable 
judgment in continuing illegal drug use even after she began work for a defense contractor in August 1999. Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process 
factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, while I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.b., and 1.c., 1.d, 1.e., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.h., I rule against Applicant on 
subparagraphs 1.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's criminal conduct.  Even though she was never prosecuted or convicted, her multiple drug use 
was illegal.  She provided no evidence other than her own statement that she has been rehabilitated. Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government clearly established security concerns over Applicant's personal conduct.  Applicant's behavior reflects questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that she may not properly safeguard classified 
information. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying  include:  5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. Applicant has 
shown poor judgment in her personal conduct by her continuing drug use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> To rebut and overcome the Government's case, Applicant would have to demonstrate that she has mitigated<A HREF="02-18279.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> this conduct.  To her credit she disclosed her drug 
use in her 2002 SF 86.  However, this disclosure cannot erase security concerns over her conduct.  Beyond her own statement on her life style changes, she 
provided no evidence of mitigation to substantiate her good work record.  Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 3.a. under SOR Paragraph 3.</SPAN></P>
