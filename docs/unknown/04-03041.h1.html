<P>Applicant was charged with criminal conduct four times, and convicted three times between 1983 and 2000. He also accrued about $6,200 in delinquent debts 
between 1996 and 2000. Applicant deliberately omitted from his December 2000 security clearance application (SF 86) relevant information about his arrest 
record and his finances. He has failed to mitigate the resulting security concerns about his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and finances. Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On April 26, 2004, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline 
F (financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR, denied three of the allegations<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> therein, and requested a 
hearing.</P> 
<P>Assignment and completion of this case was delayed due to a moratorium imposed on all cases involving potential application, discussed below, of 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986. The case was assigned to me on August 25, 2005, just after the moratorium was lifted, and I convened a hearing on October 18, 2005. The parties 
appeared as scheduled and Department Counsel presented 12 exhibits (GE 1 through 12), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own 
behalf, but submitted no documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on November 3, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>SOR &para; 1.b alleged application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 because of his conviction and sentence greater than one year. In relevant part, that statute bars, absent 
meritorious waiver, award or continuance of a clearance to an applicant who has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to serve more than one year in jail, 
even if no time was actually served. As originally enacted in 2000, this statute (commonly known as the Smith Amendment, after its chief congressional 
sponsor) was applicable to the facts of this case when the SOR was issued in April 2004. However, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as amended in late 2004, the statutory prohibition on 
granting security clearances to applicants who have been convicted in U.S. courts is now limited to those who are sentenced to and actually incarcerated for at 
least one year as a result of that conviction. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1). Because the record evidence shows Applicant was not incarcerated for this conviction, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have 
not applied the Smith Amendment in this case, and I conclude SOR &para; 1.b for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old associate designer employed by a defense contractor to perform computer-aided design work at a U.S. Navy shipyard, where he has 
worked since August 2002. Between 1995 and 2002, he worked in various manual labor positions unrelated to defense contracting. Applicant also has two years 
of college studies to his credit.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is currently separated from his wife. However, their separation started in 1996 after three years of marriage, and no divorce has been finalized. 
Applicant's estranged wife still has access to his finances. When the couple separated, Applicant moved to a different state, where he still lives. Applicant 
initially lived with his sister after his move. After a few months, he moved in with his girlfriend, continued to receive mail at his sister's address. Applicant has 
lived at his current address since  about 1999 or 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early 1983, when he was 18 years old, Applicant got into a fight and was arrested for assault with a dangerous weapon and destruction of property. He 
eventually pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited weapon and was sent to a juvenile detention facility for 18 months.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Around August 1992, Applicant was involved in another altercation. After being arrested and charged with assault with intent to maim, the charge was placed 
on a stet docket, thus holding prosecution in abeyance for at least one year on condition of Applicant's good conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After Applicant and his wife separated in 1996, he kept a car they had owned. Sometime thereafter, he let his estranged wife borrow the car but she did not 
return it. He repeatedly called his wife and her mother trying to get the car back. His mother-in-law complained to the police and Applicant was charged with 
telephone misuse. In November 1996, Applicant pled guilty to this charge and was sentenced to 18 months in jail, which was suspended. He was also fined and 
placed on probation for 18 months. The following month, Applicant moved looking for a fresh start.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2000, Applicant was stopped for speeding on a military installation near his home. He was cited for excessive speed and for driving on a 
suspended license. When he was pulled over, knowing his license had been suspended, Applicant gave the officer an old learner's permit instead of his regular 
driver's license. He was later convicted of the suspended license charge and assessed a fine and court costs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When they separated in 1996, Applicant and his wife defaulted on a car loan and executed a voluntary repossession. Applicant's estranged wife soon filed 
bankruptcy and the car finance company looked to Applicant to repay a $4,970 remainder after re-sale. A subsequent judgment against Applicant is being 
enforced through garnishment of Applicant's pay, an action started in 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While working as a mover before hiring on with his current employer, Applicant injured his  hand and required emergency room and follow-up medical care. 
He has not paid the balance of costs not covered by his insurance. Likewise, a foot injury and an emergency room visit for headaches resulted in similar debts 
for unpaid medical bills. Applicant owes a total of about $1,275 in delinquent medical debts in place since at least 1997. One debt for $569 was the subject of a 
judgment entered against Applicant in January 2000. Applicant testified he has a plan to pay his creditors about $10 to $15 each month. He started this plan the 
same month as his hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a SF 86 in December 2002. In response to question 26, which seeks information about arrests, charges, or convictions in the preceding 
seven years, Applicant omitted his 1996 conviction for telephone misuse. When interviewed on October 6, 2003, by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent 
about his arrest record and his finances, Applicant stated he did not disclose the arrest as he should have because he was concerned about possibly losing his 
clearance and his job. In response to question 37, which seeks information about any unpaid judgments, Applicant did not disclose the aforementioned unpaid 
judgments for a delinquent medical bill and for the defaulted car loan. He claims he never received notice of the two lawsuits despite receiving his other mail at 
his sisters house after he moved away from his wife.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a February 2003 DSS interview, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) which reflected he had $185 left over each month after deductions 
and expenses. Calculations that produced this figure did not include any payments to the creditors discussed herein. Nor did they include Applicant's monthly 
child support payments for three children he fathered with women other than his estranged wife. In his February 2003 statement, Applicant stated he would 
either file bankruptcy  or start to pay off his debts no later than July 2003. He did neither.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant to have access to classified information. 
The applicant must then present sufficient evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, 
applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion to comply with the government's compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, 
reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each adjudicative guideline as may be applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of 
access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are 
Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $6,200 in delinquent debts since 1996. They consist of two  unpaid medical bills referred to collection agencies 
(SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b), a third unpaid medical bill for which the creditor has obtained a judgment against the Applicant (SOR &para; 2.c), and the deficiency after re-sale from a car loan on which Applicant defaulted in 1996 and for which the creditor has obtained a judgment against Applicant (SOR &para; 2.d). The security 
concern under Guideline F is that someone who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of 
engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve his fiscal difficulties.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Additionally, how one manages his personal finances also may be indicative of one's 
overall judgment and reliability. Despite the relatively modest sums he owes, Applicant has failed to pay or otherwise resolve these debts since 1996, a 
circumstance that constitutes a history of failing to meet his financial obligations and an unwillingness or inability to pay his debts. Here, the information on 
which the government based these allegations supports Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also reviewed the Guideline F mitigating conditions (MC), the facts require consideration of MC 3.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's debts can be partially attributed to his 
divorce and to unexpected injuries. However, the value of MC 3 is attenuated because of his inaction since incurring the debts. Applicant has done nothing of 
his own volition to resolve his indebtedness. Despite telling a DSS agent over two years ago he would take corrective action, Applicant has done nothing of 
import to address his debts. The car loan debt is being satisfied through involuntary garnishment of his pay, and his monthly $10 payments to his other creditors 
is, at best, a weak attempt to mollify the government at the 11<SUP>th</SUP> hour. Given all the available information in this regard, there is no basis for application of any of 
the Guideline F mitigating conditions. I conclude Guideline F against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has also expressed concerns about Applicant's trustworthiness through SOR allegations that he deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 
Question 26 when he failed to disclose his 1996 arrest and conviction for telephone misuse (SOR &para; 3.a), and that he deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 
Question 37 when he failed to disclose two unpaid judgments (SOR &para; 3.b). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has 
exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such 
conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The record evidence shows Applicant did not list his arrest because he was 
afraid doing so would adversely affect his clearance and / or his employment. As to his omission of the unpaid judgments, Applicant avers he did not know of 
them because he did not receive notice in the mail or otherwise. I do not accept his explanation because he also testified he was receiving his mail even when he 
was between residences as he was able to use his sister's mailing address until he found his own place. In light of his acknowledged deliberate falsification of 
Question 26, it is more likely than not Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to Question 37 as well. The record as a whole in this regard supports 
application of Guideline E DC 2.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having reviewed the listed mitigating conditions under Guideline E, I find none is applicable. His falsifications were multiple and recent, and Applicant did not 
try to provide the correct information before his DSS interviews. His omission of his 1996 arrest alone is sufficient to disqualify him in that it demonstrates 
Applicant's willingness to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">place his own interests ahead of those of the government, conduct directly at odds with the fiduciary nature of holding a clearance. I 
conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also alleged Applicant was arrested, convicted, and incarcerated  in 1983 for a weapons charge (SOR &para; 1.d); that he was charged in 1992 with 
assault (SOR &para; 1.e); that he was charged and convicted of telephone misuse in 1996 (SOR &para; 1.a); and that he was cited for and convicted of driving on a 
suspended license in 2000 (SOR &para; 1.c). The resulting security concern expressed through Guideline J is that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and 
risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The criminal activity at 
issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, available information proves these allegations and supports application of 
Guideline J DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2.<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of criminal conduct from the time he was a teenager until at least 2000. Without more, his conduct and change of circumstances might 
show his conduct was not recent and that Applicant had demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation. However,  while not specifically alleged, I cannot ignore the 
import of Applicant's deliberate falsifications, discussed above. This conduct violates federal law under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which makes it a crime to knowingly 
and wilfull</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">y make a false statement or representation to any department or agency of the U.S. government concerning a matter within its jurisdiction. Violation 
of this statute is punishable by jail, a fine, or both. Applicant's signature at page 7 of his SF 86 is immediately below just such an advisement. By signing a form 
he knew to be false, Applicant further demonstrated a disregard for laws and regulations, adverse conduct at the heart of Guideline J. Accordingly, there is no 
basis in this record for application of any of the Guideline J mitigating conditions and I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-03041.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> of the entire record before me shows the government properly expressed reasonable doubts about Applicant's suitability 
to have access to classified information. The SOR was based on sufficient, reliable information about Applicant's financial history, arrest record, and deliberate 
falsification of his SF 86. Such issues bear directly on an applicant's ability to protect classified information, and to exercise the requisite good judgment and 
discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant has failed to 
provide, I conclude he has failed to overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
