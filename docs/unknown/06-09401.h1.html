<P>On November 3, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 13, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her,<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> pursuant to Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, and DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The SOR 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a 
determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, dated July 7, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A complete copy of the file 
of relevant material (FORM), dated August 31, 2006, was provided to her on September 6, 2006; and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant provided additional materials in response to the FORM, dated September 9, 2006.  The case was assigned to me on October 4, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was  responsible for the debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  She 
communicated with collection agencies, and offered to make payments, "even if it's just $5.00 per month," to no avail.  She was separated from her husband and filed for bankruptcy.  She was also 
unemployed.  Due to expenses for herself and her granddaughter, she was not able to pay her debts.  Her response to the SOR did not discuss the individual debts on the SOR.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a United States government contractor.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  From 1985 to 1989, she attended a vocational, technical or trade school, and received an associates degree.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She 
has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  She was unemployed for six months in 2002 to 2003, and again in 2004 for four to six months.  Her employment has been stable the last two years.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant 
was married in April 1989, and was separated from her husband in July 2001.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  After she separated from her husband, she fell behind in making payments on her debts.</SPAN><A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2001, Applicant had $25,841.71 in unsecured claims, and $4,000.00 in secured claims.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  She had personal property valued at $3,215.00.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 31, 2005, Applicant provided a written statement to a security investigator. Her answers were consistent with her response to the SOR, except she listed numerous debts that were 
discharged in her bankruptcy, including the six debts listed in SOR </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para;&para; 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.k.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant said she had no further obligations in regard to these six debts.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the 
schedules of liabilities were not provided by the parties, I accept Applicant's statement about the discharge of these six debts as credible.  Accordingly, I find that these six debts were</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">discharged in 
bankruptcy.  <EM>See</EM> Table, at 4, <EM>infra</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 31, 2005, Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) to the security investigator.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  In 2005, her gross salary was $1,400.00 per month, and her expenses totaled $1,231.00 
per month. After making all payments, including rent ($780.00), groceries ($100.00), clothing ($25.00), utilities ($100.00), car expenses ($125.00), student loan ($76.00) and miscellaneous 
($25.00), $169.00 per month remained. Her student loan had a balance owed of about $10,000.00.  The 2005 PFS did not include any of the debts that were listed on the SOR.  The PSF lists assets 
of $200.00 in savings, and a car valued at $2,500.00.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> </EM> </SPAN></P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG>  In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief</CENTER> 
 
introductory explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8,  that it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of 
persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of 
proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.</P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Decisions concerning eligibility for a public trust 
position cover many characteristics of an Applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information.  
Regulation, Appendix 8, clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations (<EM>an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds</EM>.). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) 
and FC DC 3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>). Each of the debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a. to 1.l. as well as her bankruptcy in SOR &para; 1.m. will be discussed briefly below.  </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her multiple failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay her debts. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>As indicated previously, Applicant admitted all SOR debts, 
and her 2001 bankruptcy, acknowledging that she fell behind in her payments, and that she was currently unable to pay her delinquent debts.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these 
two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the 
government.<SUP><A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>), FC MC 2 (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>), FC MC 3 (<EM>conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>), and FC MC 6 (<EM>the individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  In the last five years Applicant had twelve unpaid debts and a bankruptcy.  
After her bankruptcy discharged six SOR debts, she generated six additional SOR debts.  Based on evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1and 2 do not apply because 
Applicant currently has multiple (six) unpaid SOR debts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 applies to SOR &para;&para; 1b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., and 1.m. because the debts that became delinquent in 2001 resulted from her separation from her spouse.  Applicant's separation was 
largely beyond her control.  In 2001, Applicant had $25,841.71 in unsecured debts, $29,841.00 in total liabilities, and only $1,415.45 in monthly income.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Her current expenditures were 
$1,907.98 per month.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Her spouse's income is not part of the record.  I conclude, however, that Applicant's statement about how her separation affected her financial situation is credible and 
sufficient to apply FC MC 3 in regard to her debts discharged in the 2001 bankruptcy.  </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 does not apply to the six SOR debts in  &para;&para; 1a., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.j., and 1.l. because these debts became delinquent after her separation, and are currently delinquent.  Applicant provides two 
explanations for the post-2001 debt delinquencies.  After the 2001 bankruptcy, applicant had two periods of unemployment.  The impact of this unemployment is negated by her steady employment 
for the past two years, and the paucity of evidence showing how her unemployment caused these six SOR debts.  Her car broke down, and she needed to get it repaired because of her long commute 
to work.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  However, she did not explain why these six delinquent debts resulted from her car problems.  There is little other evidence to explain why the post-2001 debts alleged in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the SOR 
</SPAN>became or remained delinquent.  She had sufficient time over the last two years to demonstrate progress on her debts, but Applicant has not presented any evidence showing such progress. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant has not provided any information 
about how she attempted to resolve or repay the pre-2001 debts before utilizing bankruptcy.  She does however merit partial credit for using bankruptcy, which is a legal means for resolving these 
six debts.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Bankruptcy substantially reduced her debts, and accordingly reduced her potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements.        </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history and ongoing failure to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. Her 
actions were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> She has multiple delinquent debts.  She is 44 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  <SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from 
voluntary decisions.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation and positive behavior changes as indicated by Applicant's search for a part time job to increase her income, and plans to move to a 
residence with lower rent.<A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  So there is some possibility of increased income and lower monthly expenditures, but evidence of future behavior changes that would improve her financial 
circumstances does not presently exist.  The likelihood of recurrence remains high because she has not yet increased her income or decreased her liabilities or expenses.  Thus,  corroborating 
evidence of a change is sparse. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not </SPAN>mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's eligibility for a public trust position. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful consideration of the whole person factors"<SUP><A HREF="06-09401.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and my interpretation of 
my  responsibilities under the Regulation</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case.</SPAN>  For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a public trust position.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>
