<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On March 19, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 9, 1997, and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on
ay 12, 1997, and on June 27, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering
whether it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke
Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of seven exhibits and no
witnesses; Applicant relied on his own testimony and on two exhibits.  A transcript of the
proceedings was received on July 7, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR, except for the
factual allegation set forth under subparagraph 1.j., which he has denied.  I have accepted
Applicant's admissions and incorporate them as part of my findings of fact.  After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is 27 years old and has been employed by his current employer since March
1996.  In his first attempt to obtain a security clearance, he is applying for a clearance at the
secret level.  A favorable preliminary determination could not be made because of financial
considerations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In his signed, sworn statement to the Defense Investigative Service (Govt. Exh. 2) and in
his answer to the SOR, Applicant has admitted incurring the indebtedness alleged in the SOR
over a period of years through a variety of means:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	-- 	In 1990, he was issued a credit card by Bank A.  This account became delinquent
in September 1994.  When the account was charged off in March 1995, Applicant
owed $1,260.87.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	He opened an account with Bank B in February of 1992 in order to pay off college
debt.  This account became delinquent in July 1994; Applicant still owes $738.74
to Bank B.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	In July 1994, Applicant borrowed money from Bank C for the purchase of an
automobile.  He made his last payment on this account in February 1995; the
automobile has since been repossessed.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	Applicant owes an agency of State X--$12,999.00 plus interest--for the
education loans he obtained between October 1988 and June 1992.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	Applicant owes Insurance Company Z $31.21 for premiums which were due in
1993.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	He owes the telephone company $403.04 for services provides provided prior to
1995.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	He owes a grocery store $242.20 as a result of checks which were returned
(bounced) because he did not have sufficient funds in his account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	 Applicant owes Insurance Company Y $937.01 as a result of an automobile
accident in July 1993.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	--	Finally, an apartment complex has obtained a judgment against Applicant in the
amount of $1,070.12 for unpaid rent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In the same signed, sworn statement which Applicant made to the DIS on June 5, 1996
(Govt. Exh. 2), Applicant promised that he would begin making payments on all of the
delinquent accounts by the end of that month.  However, as of the date of the hearing, June 27,
1997, Applicant had not made a single payment on any of these accounts.  He did not take
advantage of Bank B's offer to accept a 50% payment in full satisfaction of Applicant's
obligation to them.  Instead of paying down his indebtedness as promised, Applicant has incurred
additional debt by purchasing a new car in November 1996 (Tr. 36).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	At his hearing, Applicant proffered two exhibits to establish that he had sought the
services of a financial counselor two weeks before the hearing (Tr. 34).  The counselor had
worked out a payment schedule for Applicant, but as of the date of the hearing, Applicant had
not made any payments in accordance with that schedule (Tr. 34).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion F)</CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>(1)       A history of not meeting financial obligations;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	None</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criterion F.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each
of the factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion F.  In his answer to the SOR,
Applicant admitted that he was delinquent on financial obligations totaling more than $21,000.00. 
This indebtedness has been incurred through various expenditures over the past seven years.  There
is no evidence that Applicant's financial problems have been caused by uninsured medical expenses
for Applicant or his family, that Applicant has been unemployed, or that he has experienced a
catastrophic loss.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's overdue financial obligations would not of themselves bar him from holding a
security clearance if he had made a reasonable and consistent effort during the past year to pay down
those obligations.  The indebtedness at issue--$21,845.12--is not an overwhelming sum of money;
in fact it is less than the price of many new cars.  The indebtedness is of concern because Applicant
has done nothing in the past twelve months to address the problem.  Even after promising the DIS
one year ago that he would begin making payments on each delinquent account, he has not made a
single payment on any of the accounts.  And Applicant does not explain why he has not made at least
a token payment on one or more obligation--when he appears to have had income left over each
month after paying all of his other expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Against this background, Applicant's efforts to mitigate his prior neglect are inadequate to
their task.  His visit to a financial counselor shortly before the hearing and his proffer of a payment
schedule for his delinquent obligations--prepared by that counselor--does not satisfy any of the
mitigating conditions under Criterion F.  Applicant's last minute effort to appear concerned about
his financial problems does not constitute a good faith effort "to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts."  Nor are Applicant's efforts sufficient to demonstrate "clear indications that the
problem is being resolved or is under control."  Because Applicant had failed to honor his previous
promise to make payments on delinquent obligations, his proffered financial plan is not persuasive
in the absence of some demonstrated payment history.  Criterion F is concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
