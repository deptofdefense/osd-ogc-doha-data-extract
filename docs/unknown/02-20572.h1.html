<P>Applicant is a financial analyst for a defense contractor.  Before purchasing a house in 1999, Applicant settled all delinquent debts.  Since purchasing the house, 
Applicant accumulated 22 delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,000.  Most of the debts were incurred as a result of medical treatment for Applicant.  
Applicant made no effort to satisfy any of the debt or even contact some of her creditors.  In response to questions on her security clearance applications, 
Applicant did not list a lien, three judgments, and delinquent debts past due over 180 and 90 days.  Applicant had paid the lien before purchasing her house so 
she did not deliberate answer incorrectly.  However, she knew of the judgments and the past due delinquent debts and failed to list them.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb 20, 1990), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 13, 2003.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The SOR was amended at the hearing without objection from Applicant to 
include more allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 23, 2003.  She admitted all of the allegations under Guideline F but denied the allegations under Guideline 
E.  Applicant did not request a hearing before an administrative judge.  Applicant's answer was not complete and she was requested to provided additional 
responses.  Applicant again answered the SOR in writing on January 27, 2004, admitting the allegations under Guideline F but denying the allegations under 
Guideline E.  She requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The request for a hearing was received by DOHA on February 2, 2004.  Department 
Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on September 28, 2004, and the case was assigned to me on November 8, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued 
on November 16, 2004.  The hearing was held on January 5, 2005.  Nine government exhibits and the testimony of the Applicant were received during the 
hearing.  The transcript was received on January 12, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old financial analyst employed for 4 years by a defense contractor.  She has diabetes and is unable to work at times when hospitalized for 
her illness.  She has incurred delinquent debt mostly for medical bills associated with her medical condition.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant purchased a home in 1999 and satisfied 
all of her debts to obtain financing for the house.  A credit bureau report received as part of her security application revealed significant debt accumulated since 
1999 and the subject of the allegations in the SOR.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Her present past due debt amounts to approximately $25,000 to $30,000.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The initial SOR had 14 allegations under Guideline F.  Debts a, b, and c were unpaid judgments issued against Applicant in 2001 and 2002.  Nine allegations 
(debts a, d, e, f, h, i, j, k, and l) were the result of unpaid medical bills.  No action has been taken by Applicant to inquire about the bills or resolve the debts.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN>  
Applicant could not pay the bills because she had been hospitalized and unable to work.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Debts b and g are the same delinquent debt which originated from a 
credit union loan.  Applicant has taken no action to resolve this debt.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Debt c is for furniture that Applicant said she paid off.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant was provided an 
opportunity to provide documentary information the debt was satisfied </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">but has not done so.  Debts m and n were for telephone service and Applicant took no 
action to satisfy these delinquent debts.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR was amended at the hearing to add nine additional allegations under Guideline F.   Applicant was aware of the additional allegations and elected to 
continue with the hearing.  Only eight of the allegations were accepted as additional allegations.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Four of the allegations (debts o, q, t, u) were medical bills for 
which Applicant took no action to resolve.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Allegations r and s are the same debts listed in the original allegations as debts b and g.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Allegation v is for 
another debt to a telephone company and Applicant has taken no action to resolve.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Debt w is for a returned check and Applicant has taken no action to resolve 
the debt.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Of the 22 allegations accepted under Guideline F, four allegations concern the same debt and will be considered as only one allegation; one debt  
Applicant said was satisfied but provided no documentary evidence it has been satisfied; and Applicant has taken no action to resolve the other 18 allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "No" to question 36 on her October 9, 2001 security clearance application requesting if there were any tax liens filed against her in the last 
7 years.  On the same application, she also answered "No" to question 38 requesting if in the last 7 years she had ever been delinquent on a debt over 180 days, 
and question 39 whether she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt.  Applicant answered "No" to question 37 on the same application requesting if 
she had any unpaid judgements in the last 7 years.  In fact, a tax lien was filed against Applicant in April 1997 which Applicant satisfied in 1999.  As noted 
above, her credit report shows she was over 180 days delinquent in the last 7 years on a number of debts and was presently over 90 days past due on a number 
of debts.  As noted above, debts b, c, and d were unpaid judgments incurred in the last 7 years.  Applicant explained that she believed she did not have to list the 
tax lien since it had been satisfied, and was careless in reading questions 37, 38, and 39 and the information required.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant thought about filing bankruptcy but decided not to take that action.  She thought about seeking a second job to increase her income but has not taken 
any steps to do so.  She could not recall if she received notice of the judgments against her.  She did not know if her insurance company should cover part of her 
medical bills but she has not inquired of the insurance company if the bill should be covered.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>Under Guideline F (Financial Conditions), a security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financial 
irresponsibility may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly 
in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), a security concern 
exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, <EM>lack of candor, dishonesty, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="02-20572.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicants debts that have not been satisfied bring the matter within Financial Consideration Disqualifying Condition Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not 
meeting financial obligations</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant has accumulated significant delinquent debts 
since 1999.  She has not satisfied these debts and has taken little if any action to learn about the debts and the action required to satisfy them.  I conclude the 
disqualifying conditions have been established.</P> 
<P>The Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions that should be considered for Applicant's delinquent debts are: Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was 
not recent</EM>); Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.2  (it <EM>was an isolated incident</EM>); Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexplained medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>); and Directive &para; 
E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  All of the delinquent debts were incurred since 
1999 so they are recent.  While most of the delinquent debts are the result of medical bills, there are also delinquent debts for loans, furniture purchases, and 
telephone bills.  The delinquent debts are not isolated to one series or type of debt.  While most of the delinquent debts are the result of medical bills and 
beyond her control, Applicant is employed and can make efforts to resolve the debts.  In most cases, Applicant has not made any good-faith effort to inquire on 
some of the delinquent debts let alone satisfy them.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated any of the disqualifying conditions and security concerns under 
Guideline F.</P> 
<P>Applicant's incorrect answers to questions 36, 37, 38, and 39 of the security clearance applicant brings the matter under Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.3 (<EM>deliberately 
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to . . . other official representative in connection with a personal security 
or trustworthiness determination</EM>).  A finding of falsification requires evidence that the Applicant acted with an intent to mislead or deceive the government.  
The record evidence as a whole must be considered to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning Applicant's intent or state of 
mind at the time the statement was made.  As to question 36 concerning the tax lien, Applicant stated she did not think she needed to note this since it has been 
paid.  In spite of the clear language of question 36 to list all lien in the last 7 years, I conclude Applicant was confused on responding to the lien question, and 
there is no evidence Applicant intended to mislead or defraud the government in her response to question 36.  Applicant knew she had some judgments against 
her and she knew she had significant delinquent debt over 180 and 90 days past due.  She could not misunderstand the questions.  A quick and light reading of 
the questions before responding would have alerted Applicant to her required response.  I conclude the disqualifying condition under Guideline E has been 
established only as to allegations 2b, 2c, and 2d.</P> 
<P>The Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions that should be considered for Applicant are Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, 
was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>).  The incorrect information was on Applicant's most recent security clearance 
application and Applicant only provided the correct information when questioned at the hearing by Department Counsel.  She made no effort to provide correct 
information before being confronted with the facts.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the disqualifying condition as to questions 37, 38, and 39.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept for a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  I conclude Applicant is 
not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
