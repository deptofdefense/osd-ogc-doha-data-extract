<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>On August 3, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 27, 1996, and requested that his
case be decided without a hearing.<A HREF="96-0557.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Applicant received the Government's File of Relevant
aterial (FORM) consisting of 16 exhibits on March 26, 1997.  He did not offer any rebuttal to
the information in the FORM, or any additional exculpatory information on his own behalf.  The
case record was closed on April 26, 1997, and on May 7, 1997, the case was assigned to this
Administrative Judge for decision. </P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG>The SOR alleges illegal involvement with drugs under Criterion H.  Specific allegations
are that Applicant used marijuana (from early 1984 to the summer of 1995), hashish (from early
1984 to the summer of 1995), cocaine (in 1995), and heroin (in 1995), that he purchased
marijuana (from early 1984 to the summer of 1995), hashish (from early 1984 to 1993), and
crack cocaine (from early 1993 to March 1996),  that he sold crack cocaine for profit from early
1993 to March 1996, and that he was arrested for attempting to purchase marijuana in 1992.  The
SOR alleges that Applicant demonstrated questionable judgment, untrustworthiness , and
unreliability under Criterion E when he falsified material information about his drug involvement
on a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) and in two signed, sworn statements to the Defense
Investigative Service (DIS).  Finally, the SOR alleges that Applicant's falsifications constituted
criminal conduct under Criterion J.</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted that he had used heroin and cocaine, that he had purchased marijuana
and hashish, and that he had been arrested for attempting to purchase marijuana in 1992.  He
denied--without explanation--all other allegations under Criterion H, all of the allegations
under Criterion E, and he did not answer the allegation under Criterion J.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 26 year old employee of a defense contractor who has worked for his
current employer since November 1992.  Previously,  he had served in the United States Navy
from 1988 to 1992.  He  is seeking to retain the confidential clearance granted to him in February
1996.  The DOHA could not make a preliminary determination on Applicant's suitability to
retain his security clearance because of the misconduct alleged in the SOR.</P>

<P>	Applicant first became involved with illegal drugs in 1984 when he used
marijuana/hashish<A HREF="96-0557.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> at the age of 14.  From the time of his first use until he joined the Navy in
August 1988, Applicant used marijuana/hashish an average of once a month.  He did not use
marijuana/hashish during the first few months that he was in the Navy, but did use it again in
early 1989.  Because he was afraid of testing positive in a urinalysis, he limited his use of 
marijuana/hashish to only 3-5 times while he was in the Navy.  After he was discharged from the
Navy in August 1992, he began using marijuana/hashish once or twice a week and continued this
rate of usage until 1993 when he reduced his consumption to once a month.  He continued to use
marijuana/hashish at the rate of once a month until he stopped all use in the summer of 1995.</P>

<P>	Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs has not been limited to his use of
marijuana/hashish.  He used heroin one time during the 1984-1985 time frame and he used
cocaine during the same time period.  He estimates that he purchased marijuana/hashish one-fourth of the time that he had used the substance, making his last purchase of marijuana/hashish
in 1993.  More recently Applicant was involved in the purchase and sale--but not the use--of
crack cocaine.  From early 1993 to March 1996, he trafficked in crack cocaine to "make some
extra cash" because he was "having some financial problems at home" (Item # 13 Gov. FORM).</P>

<P>	When Applicant completed his NAQ on January 25, 1995 (Item # 10), he certified that:</P>

<P>		....the entries made by me are true, complete and accurate to the
best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.</P>

<P>In response to question 20.a. which asked if he had used or possessed any narcotic (to include
heroin or cocaine)....hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or
hashish), </P>

<P>Applicant answered "yes" and explained that he had used marijuana infrequently with his last use
being in November 1992.  In response to question 20.b. which asked if he had ever been involved
in the illegal purchase or sale of marijuana or other illegal drugs, Applicant answered "yes."  He
explained that his involvement with the purchase and sale of illegal drugs had been limited to a
one-time  attempt to purchase marijuana in 1992.   </P>

<P>	Later, incident to his first interview with the DIS on September 25, 1995, Applicant
signed a statement in which he swore that he had used marijuana a total of four times: once in
1984, twice in 1988, and once in November 1992 (Item # 11 of Gov. FORM).  In the same
statement, he denied that he had ever purchased or sold marijuana/hashish or any other illegal
drug, while admitting that he had been arrested for attempting to purchase marijuana in 1992. 
On March 13, 1996, in a second signed statement to the DIS, Applicant swore again that his
involvement with illegal drugs was limited to that which he had disclosed on his earlier
(September) statement (Item # 12 of Gov. FORM)..  </P>

<P>	Applicant finally admitted the full extent of his involvement with illegal drugs during a
third interview with the DIS on April 29, 1996.  In a sworn statement which he signed incident to
that interview, Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana/hashish with varying
frequency--as often as weekly--from 1984 to the summer of 1995; he admitted that he had
purchased marijuana/hashish one-fourth of the time that he had used it between 1984 and 1993;
he admitted that he had used heroin (one time) and cocaine (one time) in 1984 or 1985; and he
admitted that he had purchased crack cocaine and sold it for profit from early 1993 to March
1996.  Applicant admitted that he had not been "truthful from the beginning" because he was
afraid of loosing his job (Item # 13 of Gov. FORM).</P>

<P>	In his answer to the SOR, Applicant has denied that he purchased and sold crack cocaine
for profit between early 1993 and March 1996.  He has also denied that he used
marijuana/hashish between 1984 and 1995.  However, he has not explained why he admitted
participating in these activities in this third signed, sworn statement to the DIS if he had not--in
fact--participated in them.  Without such an explanation, his admissions in Item # 12 of the
Government FORM are found to be true.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER></U></STRONG>(Criterion H)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>	(a)	drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the
Controlled  Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>	(b)	inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from
approved medical direction. </P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(1)	Any drug abuse</P>

<P>	(2)	Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,
sale, 		or distribution.<STRONG>	</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(3)	A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>PERSONAL CONDUCT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion E)</CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(2)	The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material
facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,
award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,</P>

<P>	(3)	Deliberate providing false of misleading information concerning relevant and
material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority,
or other official representative in connection with a personal security
trustworthiness determination.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>None Applicable</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion J)</CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</STRONG>:</P>

<P>	(1)	Any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</STRONG>:</P>

<P>	None Applicable</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria H, E, and J.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion H.  Applicant has admitted
that he purchased and sold crack cocaine regularly from early 1993 to March 1996 to earn extra
income.  He has admitted that he used marijuana/hashish monthly until the summer of 1995, and he
has admitted that he purchased marijuana/hashish until 1993.  And he admitted to one-time use of
heroin and cocaine in the 1984-1985 time frame.</P>

<P>	Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs other than crack cocaine is mitigated by the
passage of time and by his stated intention not to use these substances in the future.  There is no
evidence to refute his statement that he has not used marijuana/hashish since the summer of 1995,
nor is there evidence to refute his statement that his one-time use of cocaine and heroin occurred
more than ten years ago.  Subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.j. are concluded for
Applicant.	</P>

<P> 	More problematic is Applicant's involvement with crack cocaine.  In typical drug
involvement cases, evidence that an individual has trafficked in an illegal drug suggests a much
deeper connection with the substance--long term use, perhaps addiction--than does occasional use
of a drug by itself.  This increased connection significantly increases the likelihood that the
individual will continue to abuse the drug, or that he will relapse if he is able to quit for a period of
time.  Because there is no evidence to counter Applicant's claim that he has never used crack
cocaine, there is no basis for concluding that his drug trafficking experience portends the likelihood
of further drug involvement. Applicant's trafficking in crack cocaine was very serious criminal
misconduct, but does not--under the circumstances of this case--increase the likelihood that his
involvement with other illegal drugs will continue or resume.  Subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. are
concluded for Applicant.</P>

<P>	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire...or deliberately providing false and misleading information...to an
investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered relevant
and material when they are capable of influencing a federal agency's decision, e.g., a decision to
grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance, Applicant's monthly use of marijuana/hashish
at the time he completed his NAQ in January 1995 falls well within the definition of materiality. 
Also falling with the definition of materiality, and also omitted from his NAQ, were Applicant's
purchasing and selling  crack cocaine for profit since 1993, and his purchase of marijuana/hashish
from 1984 to 1993.  Applicant's omissions and misrepresentations about his drug involvement
continued through interviews with the DIS in September 1995 and March 1996.  Coincident with
these interviews, Applicant signed sworn statements which omitted and misrepresented material
information about his use, purchase and sale of illegal drugs.</P>

<P>	Because Applicant had not been truthful to the DIS on three separate occasions--most
recently in March 1996-- his falsification was neither an isolated incident, nor was it far removed
from the present.  When Applicant finally admitted the full extent of his involvement with illegal
drugs in April of 1996, he did not make these admissions under circumstances where he can be
credited with making a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his prior falsification.  It was 15 months
after he had signed his NAQ, and 12 months since he had signed the first signed, sworn statement
to the DIS. Nor is Applicant's falsification mitigated by his explanation that he had not been truthful
because he was afraid of  losing his job.  It seems particularly ironic that Applicant would lie about
misconduct to protect his livelihood and then continue to purchase and sell crack cocaine--the very
misconduct which he was lying to cover up.  Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are concluded against
Applicant.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	The government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant's willfully withholding
information from the DoD on matters that were clearly relevant to his security clearance eligibility
violates 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential to influence the
course of his background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD.</P>

<P>	Applicant's trafficking in crack cocaine for three years--from 1993 to 1996--is of even
greater concern to the DoD than Applicant's falsification.  Trafficking in a dangerous illegal drug
is always very serious criminal activity.  It is serious when done on a limited or occasional basis, and
significantly more serious when done on a regular basis over a longer time period.  And there is no
mitigation in the circumstances which led Applicant to this activity.  Applicant was not destitute;
he did not need this money to provide the essentials of life for his family.  By participating in this
criminal activity, Applicant demonstrated that he was ready, willing and able to break the law on a
regular basis over an extended period of time to earn extra income.  This behavior does not portend
well for a person seeking to retain access to classified information.  Subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b. are
concluded against Applicant.</P>
