<P>Applicant admitted using the internet to download and save numerous images of "hardcore" child pornography, visit pedophilia-oriented chat rooms, and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 12, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal 
Conduct).  The security concerns under all three guidelines were based on allegations that Applicant obtained and stored "less than 1,000 hardcore images of 
underage children" on his computer and magnetic tapes (SOR &para; 1.a.) and "traded hardcore images of underage children" on the internet (SOR &para; 1.b.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 3, 2004, denied the allegations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on June 13, 2005 
and heard on August 22, 2005.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's Motion in Limine</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the hearing, Applicant filed a Motion in Limine to preclude Department Counsel from introducing in evidence "reports of investigation and documents 
based thereon," arguing such evidence was inadmissible under the Directive &para; E3.1.20.  I denied Applicant's motion as moot with respect to reports of 
investigation, based on Department Counsel's representation that no reports of investigation would be offered in evidence.  I deferred ruling on the admissibility 
of documents based on reports of investigation until the hearing.  At the hearing, I denied Applicant's motion to exclude a Clearance Decision Statement dated 
August 4, 2004, notifying Applicant he was determined ineligible for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and reciting the reasons for the 
decision.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Although the underlying report of investigation on which the government's decision to deny a clearance would not be admissible without an 
authenticating witness, I concluded the written notice of a decision to deny a clearance is admissible under &para; E3.1.20 as an official record created in the regular 
course of business that was furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Department of Defense to 
safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Department Counsel's Motion to Compel Discovery</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After receiving notice of Applicant's intent to call a licensed clinical psychologist as an expert witness, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Compel 
Discovery, seeking disclosure of  "any treatment or progress notes, psychological testing information and all reports prepared by the witness."  I granted the 
motion with respect to any documentary evidence Applicant intended to offer in evidence and denied it with respect to any confidential documents furnished to 
Applicant or his counsel that would not be offered in evidence at the hearing.  Under the Directive &para; E3.1.3., discovery is limited to documentary evidence 
intended to be submitted to the Administrative Judge.  Under the Directive &para; E3.1.11., "Discovery by Department Counsel after issuance of an SOR may be 
granted by the Administrative Judge only upon a showing of good cause."  Department Counsel argued she could not prepare her case in chief or her cross-examination of the witness without the disclosures she requested.  She did not assert, nor does the record suggest, she was prevented from interviewing the 
expert witness before the hearing.  I concluded Department Counsel had not shown good cause for the requested discovery.  Department Counsel renewed her 
motion at the hearing, and I adhered to my ruling.<STRONG><A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></STRONG>  In accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 705, I permitted Department Counsel to cross-examine the 
expert witness about the facts underlying his diagnosis, and I required the witness to disclose the notes on which his testimony was based. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the pleadings and the testimonial and documentary evidence introduced at the hearing, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 58-year-old information security engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his present employer since October 2001.  He has been 
married for 35 years and has a 23-year-old daughter.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He served in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until September 1994 and retired as a lieutenant 
colonel.  He received a security clearance in the Air Force and has held a clearance for more than 30 years.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record includes five affidavits from colleagues, supervisors, and a neighbor, attesting to Applicant's good judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and 
integrity.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  It also includes two awards and a letter of appreciation recognizing Applicant's contributions to his employer.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  While the affiants knew Applicant's 
application for a security clearance was at issue, they were not aware of the specific allegations in the SOR.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Clearance Decision Statement dated August 4, 2004,<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> notified Applicant he had been determined ineligible for access to SCI.  This determination was based 
on two interviews conducted on June 4 and July 19, 2004.  The record does not reflect whether those interviews were reduced to writing.  According to the 
Clearance Decision Statement, Applicant admitted he downloaded pornography from internet newsgroups from 1995 to 1999, downloading as many as a 
thousand pictures nightly.  He admitted building a collection of pornography, and he estimated he had compiled 10-12 tapes of pornographic images, each tape 
containing about 10,000 images.  Approximately one thousand images portrayed children engaged in sexual activities.  He admitted seeking out child 
pornography for sexual gratification, visiting pedophile chat rooms several times a week,  and trading child pornography on the internet once or twice a week.  
He stated he erased all images of child pornography after undergoing a polygraph in 1999, because he feared legal action and loss of his security clearance.  
Applicant stated he continues to view adult pornography on the internet once or twice a week, but he has not intentionally sought out child pornography.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The 
interviews in June and July 2004 were a follow-up to an interview in October 2003, in which Applicant admitted downloading pornography on the internet, 
downloading pornographic images of children in order to "have a 'complete' collection of images," and asserting he was unaware possession of the images was 
illegal.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1995, Applicant's marriage suffered "a little bit" because he began experiencing erectile dysfunction and h</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is snoring "drove [his] wife out of the bedroom."<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  
He began viewing and collecting pornography at this time.  He asserted at the hearing that the Clearance Decision Statement denying him eligibility for access 
to SCI was "extremely exaggerated."<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He testified he was asked to estimate the frequency of his activity and he gave large numbers to make sure he did not 
understate it.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He described the interviews in 2004 as contentious, because the interviewers insisted on Applicant telling them the specific number of images 
he downloaded and saved, and he repeatedly told them he did not know.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  There was no discussion of the definition of pornography during the interviews.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he started downloading materials nightly in 1995 but his activity was less frequent in the subsequent years.  Because of the state of internet 
technology in 1995, the process was slow.  He assumed the materials were legal because the internet service providers permitted them.  He would download a 
few hundred images each time he worked at the computer, but did not print any of them.  He testified many pictures depicted nudity but most did not depict 
erotic behavior.  He testified he deleted images of children in sexually suggestive or erotic activity when he saw them because he considered them offensive.  
He estimated he kept about 100 images of children, but none showed their genitalia in a way intended to be sexually arousing.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  He estimated there were no 
more than 10 incidents of trading images of children, each incident involving four or five images.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he thought most of the images were old, based on hairstyles, clothing, and the environment.  Many of the images appeared to be copied from 
magazines, with folds and torn edges in the images.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied accessing pedophile chat rooms.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He admitted visiting adult chat rooms but denied discussing fantasies of having sex with a child.  He 
denied being sexually attracted to children.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he used the term "hardcore" in his October 2003 statement to mean pornography that shows genitalia.  At that time, he regarded pornography 
as "softcore" if it shows upper body nudity or apparent sexual activity without actually showing genitalia.  He did not know the materials he downloaded might 
be illegal until October 2003.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  He deleted the images of children involved in sexual activity because they were distasteful, not because he thought they were 
illegal.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified his erectile dysfunction has been solved with medication.  He now uses a device to reduce his level of snoring.  He and his wife now share 
the same bed again.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant sought and received treatment about a year ago for his attraction to pornography.  He testified the doctor advised him to increase his intimacy with his 
spouse, and he has followed that advice.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an avid collector.  He has extensive coin and stamp collections.  In his October 2003 statement, he stated he downloaded pictures of children to 
have a complete collection of pornography.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist during the summer and fall of 2004 in connection with his application for access to SCI.  The 
psychologist had extensive experience making psychological diagnoses and  evaluations of personal reliability.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The psychologist testified Applicant's preoccupation with pornography during 1995-1999 was "clearly dysfunctional," but it had ameliorated by the time of the 
clinical evaluation.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  The psychologist found "no indications of pathology outside of being somewhat of a retiring, anxious, and avoidant individual."  
Applicant's personality would make him "more vulnerable than the average person to comply with an examiner's demands" during an interrogation.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He 
found Applicant to be embarrassed by the situation, remorseful, and somewhat guarded.  He concluded Applicant did not meet the diagnostic criteria for 
pedophilia or any other sexual disorder or dysfunction, and he found no "counter-indications" for holding a position of trust.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel extensively cross-examined the psychologist about the factual basis for his diagnosis.  The psychologist found Applicant to be a mildly 
compulsive, anxious person who collects things.  Applicant would scan and look at what he collected and then store it, eventually storing a substantial quantity 
of images.  A small percentage of the images were of children.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The psychologist testified Applicant told him most of the images of children were "fairly benign" and he deleted the images that were blatantly sexual.  The 
psychologist recalled Applicant telling him he stored some images of children that had "blatant sexual content," but he did not "go back and revisit those."<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  
Applicant denied seeking out images of children's sexual acts for sexual gratification.  Applicant admitted he had accessed two chat rooms whose names 
suggested child pornography.  The psychologist concluded Applicant's access to those sites was a "casual hit," based on experimentation or curiosity, rather 
than a focused search.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied having fantasies of engaging in sex with children and did not find pedophilia sexually stimulating.  He told the psychologist he did not find 
prepubescent children sexually attractive.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  The psychologist's recollection of his discussions with Applicant was that Applicant referred to pornography as 
"hardcore" when it depicted sexual activity, but mere nudity was not "hardcore."<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife of 35 years testified Applicant is a loving, devoted husband and father.  She corroborated Applicant's testimony about his problems with 
snoring and sexual impotence and supported his testimony that those problems have been ameliorated.  She corroborated the psychologist's testimony that 
Applicant is a compulsive collector.  She was unaware of Applicant's collection of pornography until he disclosed it after his application for access to SCI was 
denied.  She testified Applicant has never demonstrated any interest in or curiosity about child pornography.  To the contrary, he has declared his disapproval of 
it. <A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR sets out security concerns under three separate guidelines, but the concerns under all three guidelines were based on allegations that Applicant used 
the internet to obtain, trade, and store "hardcore images of underage children."  The word "pornography" does not appear in the SOR, but the parties clearly 
understood the allegations to encompass pornography.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may apply if the sexual behavior is 
of "of a criminal nature."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.1.  DC 1 is not established for the reasons discussed below under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2 applies when there is "[c]ompulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a pattern of self-destructive or high-risk behavior or 
that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.2.  There is evidence Applicant is addicted to adult pornography, but he apparently 
was not attracted to child pornography except as a matter of curiosity.  His behavior was not self-destructive or high risk, except to the extent it made him 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, discussed below under DC 3.  The psychologist found Applicant was not suffering from pedophilia or any other 
sexual disorder or dysfunction.  I conclude DC 2 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3 applies when the sexual behavior "causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.2.3.  Applicant was 
embarrassed by his behavior.  He erased the tapes to avoid detection.  He concealed his behavior from his family until after the SOR was issued.  He has not 
disclosed it to the colleagues, supervisors, and the neighbor who submitted affidavits on his behalf.  I conclude DC 3 is established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4 applies when sexual behavior "reflects lack of discretion or judgment."  Applicant's behavior jeopardized his relationships with his spouse, his daughter, 
and his professional colleagues, and it made him vulnerable to blackmail.  I conclude DC 4 is established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions (MC) under this guideline are relevant.  MC 2 applies when "[t]he behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent 
conduct of a similar nature."  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.3.2.  Although Applicant continues to view adult pornography, he stated he has not sought out or viewed 
child pornography since 1999, and there is no evidence to the contrary.  I conclude MC 2 is established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 applies when "[t]here is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability."  Applicant served in the Air Force for 
more than 20 years, has worked for a defense contractor for four years, and held a security clearance for more than 30 years.  His four-year period of 
involvement with child pornography is the only evidence reflecting adversely on his suitability for a security clearance.  I conclude MC 3 is established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 4 applies when "[t]he behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress."  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established, 
because Applicant continues to feel embarrassment about his conduct and has disclosed it only to his spouse and a few government security officials.  His 
neighbor and colleagues who submitted affidavits on his behalf were unaware of his involvement in child pornography.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions discussed above, I also have considered the nature, extent, frequency, and seriousness of 
Applicant's conduct.  Applicant was a mature adult at the time, married and the father of a teenaged daughter, and he should have realized the potential 
consequences of his behavior.  He appears to have changed his behavior, and the likelihood of recurrence is low, but the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress remains.  His exercise of poor judgment spanned four years, and it stopped only because he feared detection.  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concern based on his sexual conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment can raise a security concern this guideline.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) applies where 
there is "[r]eliable unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances."  I conclude DC 1 is not 
established, because it applies to information from someone other than an applicant.  In this case, all the unfavorable information was provided by Applicant 
himself during the security investigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4 applies when there is evidence of personal conduct that increases an applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress "such as engaging in 
activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail."  I conclude DC 
4 is established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established.  I  note, however, Applicant has expressed remorse for his conduct, has refrained 
from involvement in child pornography since 1999, and recently sought treatment because of concern about his continued interest in adult pornography.  He has 
a long record of government service.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, Applicant's testimony at the hearing indicated a tendency to minimize his culpability.  At the hearing, he categorically denied visiting 
internet chat rooms whose names suggested interest in pedophilia, but he specifically mentioned two such chat rooms when he was interviewed by the security 
investigator in June 2004 and again when he was interviewed by the psychologist.  In his testimony, he claimed he was forced by security investigators to 
exaggerate the numbers of incidents.  He testified he exchanged child pornography no more than a total of 10 times, suggesting his earlier admission of 
exchanging pornography one or twice a week was an exaggeration.  He testified he deleted images of children engaged in sexual activity because he found them 
offensive, contradicting his admission to security investigators that he saved about one thousand images of children involved in sexual activity and his 
admission to the psychologist that he saved some images depicting sexual activity but did not later view them.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's lack of good judgment and his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress are not mitigated.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on his personal 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness."  Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.1.  Two disqualifying conditions are enumerated under this guideline.  DC 1 applies when there are "[a]llegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged."  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.  DC 2 applies when there is "[a] single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR does not use the word "pornography," nor does it allege Applicant violated any specific criminal statute.  At the hearing, Department Counsel did not 
assert Applicant violated any state or local law.  Instead, she asserted Applicant's conduct violated the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 
2251 <EM>et seq.<A HREF="03-06828.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  </EM>Under this statute, "child pornography" means visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 2256 (8).  Furthermore, the Supreme 
Court has declared those provisions of the statute prohibiting "virtual" pornography invalid, thus limiting the coverage of the statute to child pornography 
created by using real children, and excluding from its coverage pornography produced by using youthful-looking adults or computer-imaging technology.  
<EM>Ashcroft v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., </EM>535 U.S. 234, 12 S.Ct. 1389 (2002).  Finally, the statute created an affirmative defense if the individual possessed 
less than three pornographic images and promptly took reasonable steps to destroy them.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 2252A(d).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he promptly deleted all images of children engaged in sexual activity because he found them offensive.  His testimony, if believed, would 
establish an affirmative defense under the statute.  His testimony, however, contradicts his earlier admissions to security investigators and the psychologist that 
he saved some images of children that were blatantly sexual.  I have doubts about the veracity of this aspect of his testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also testified at the hearing that he used the term "pornography" to mean upper body nudity or apparent sexual activity without actually showing 
genitalia, and "hardcore pornography" to mean depiction of nudity showing genitalia.  His testimony, if believed, would establish his use of the term was much 
broader than the statutory definition, which requires depiction of sexually explicit conduct.  On the other hand, the psychologist testified Applicant understood 
"hardcore pornography" meant depiction of sexual activity.  Nevertheless, under either definition, Applicant's admissions of involvement in "hardcore child 
pornography" in the interviews with security investigators and the psychologist did not admit the involvement of real children in the production of the images.  
Furthermore, since the images were destroyed and never analyzed, it cannot be determined whether they meet the statutory requirement that real children be 
used in their production.  I conclude the evidence of record does not establish an admission or violation of the Child Pornography Prevention act of 1996.  
Department Counsel did not assert or produce evidence that Applicant violated any other federal, state, or local law.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 1 and DC 2 
are not established.</SPAN></P>
