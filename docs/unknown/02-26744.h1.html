<P>Applicant fled Vietnam when the North Vietnamese conquered South Vietnam in 1975.  He has been a U.S. citizen since 1981.  He is married to a naturalized 
U.S. citizen, and his children were born in the U.S.  One of his brothers and an uncle are naturalized U.S. citizens.  Another brother just emigrated from 
Vietnam to the U.S.  Applicant has held a security clearance continuously for the past 22 years.  Applicant mitigated security concerns raised by his father and

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 27 April 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-26744.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 4 May 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 9 August 2004.  On 
14 September 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 23 September 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  He has held a security clearance continuously since 1982.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in Vietnam.  In April 1975, when Applicant was a 17-year-old high school student, the Communist forces from North Vietnam 
began the final overthrow of the South Vietnamese government.  Applicant's mother feared he would be drafted and told him to leave.  Applicant and his older 
brother, a member of the South Vietnamese military who had worked closely with U.S. forces in Vietnam, fled Saigon on a boat.  The boat ran out of fuel, food, 
and water.  Applicant and his brother transferred to a barge and were eventually rescued by the U.S. Navy and taken to the Philippine Islands.  From there, 
Applicant was flown to Guam.  A few months later a sponsor was found for Applicant, and he was flown to the U.S.  That fall, he enrolled in high school.  
After graduation, he enrolled in college and, in 1981, graduated with a degree in electrical engineering.  In 1981, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  
Since 1982, he has worked for the same organization, although it has changed names several times.  He is a highly skilled and trusted member of the 
engineering staff.  He received his master's degree in in 1985.</P> 
 
<P>In 1983, Applicant married a woman who had emigrated from Vietnam in 1975.  She became a U.S. citizen in 1981 or 1982.  They have two children born in 
the U.S., a 13-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son.  Neither of their children speak Vietnamese.  All of Applicant's wife's immediate family reside in the 
U.S. and are U.S. citizens.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother is deceased.  His father is 75 years old, is in very poor health, and is a citizen resident of Vietnam.  He had been a police officer prior to the 
North Vietnamese take-over.  At the end of the war in Vietnam, Applicant's father was sent to a re-education camp.  He then began repairing bicycles for a 
living.  He is now retired.  Applicant and his older brother sent their father approximately $3,000 so he could repair his home.  Applicant sends a monetary gift 
of about $900 twice a year to Vietnam to be divided among his relatives there.  He speaks to his father briefly by telephone twice a year and one of his sisters 
five times a year.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's older brother is a citizen resident of the U.S.  He married a native-born U.S. citizen and they have two children, neither of whom speak Vietnamese.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant sponsored his youngest brother for entry to the U.S.  Since the issuance of the SOR, the brother has arrived and is now a U.S. resident.  One other 
brother and three sisters remain in Vietnam.  None of them work for the government and none of them are agents of a foreign power.  His sisters are 
housewives and do not work outside their homes.  Applicant is close to one of his sisters, but does not communicate with his other sisters or brother living in 
Vietnam.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's uncle served four years in a re-education camp after the war.  Upon his release in 1979, he escaped Vietnam and is now a U.S. citizen as are his 
wife and six children.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has made two trips back to Vietnam: once in 1995 to visit his family and once in 1998 to return to an uncle's family money the uncle had willed to 
Applicant.  Applicant sought permission from the company security office before each trip and reported for debriefings after the trips.  His wife has never 
returned to Vietnam and his children have not visited there.  Applicant does not intend to return to Vietnam even if his father or sisters become ill or die.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns a home and has financial investments in the U.S.  He has no assets or financial interests in Vietnam or other foreign countries.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father (&para; 1.a) and his five siblings are citizen residents of Vietnam (&para; 1.c); he and his brother bought a house in Vietnam 
for their father (&para; 1.b); he sends $900 every January and June to his father in Vietnam (&para; 1.d); he traveled to Vietnam in July 1995 and August 1998 (&para; 1.e); and 
he was working to sponsor his brother, a resident of Vietnam, for entry into the U.S. (&para; 1.f).  A security risk may exist when members of an applicant's 
immediate family or persons to whom the applicant may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has immediate family members--his father, three sisters, and a brother--who are citizen residents of Vietnam.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  There are two mitigating conditions that might apply to 
Applicant's case: a determination that the family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the applicant to choose between loyalty to the person and loyalty to the U.S. (MC E2.A2.1.3.1) and contact and correspondence with foreign 
citizens are casual and infrequent (MC E2.A2.1.3.3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Evidence an applicant who has contacts with family members in a foreign country raises a rebuttable presumption those contacts are not casual in nature.  ISCR 
Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  I am unable to conclude Applicant's relationship with his family members in Vietnam is casual in light of his 
contacts with his father and sister, sending them money twice a year, helping finance the reconstruction of his father's home, and sponsoring his brother into the 
U.S.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts that maintaining contact with and his family is done out of a sense of duty rather than any emotional ties.  Under Guideline B, it is not 
important whether the ties with foreign citizens are caused by close emotional ties or born out of a sense of duty.  Both may be disqualifying under DC 
E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the nature of the government in the country in which an applicant has associates is not dispositive of whether a security clearance should be granted, it 
may influence whether those foreign associates are "in a position to be exploited by a foreign power."  "Vietnam is a one-party state, ruled and controlled by the 
Communist Party of Vietnam."  Ex. 7 at 1.  Despite some recent improvement in the areas of individual freedoms, people's control over their lives, and 
expanded freedom of religion, the Government's human rights record remains poor, and it continues to commit serious abuses.  Ex. 6 at 1; <EM>Id.</EM>  However, 
Vietnam is not one of the states known to commit military or economic espionage against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, Applicant has possessed a security clearance for 22 years.  This fact does not prevent the Government from reconsidering an applicant's 
security suitability based on information available at the time previous decisions to grant a security clearance were made.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 4 
(App. Bd. May 19, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Nevertheless, the security clearance process requires making predictive judgments based on all of the facts and circumstances of the 
case.  The holding of a security clearance for 22 years without adverse incident is certainly a matter that should be seriously considered in making such a 
judgment.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully considering all of the evidence, I conclude MC E2.A2.1.3.1 applies.  I find Applicant's family members in Vietnam are not in a position of 
vulnerability such as to place Applicant in a position of having to choose between his loyalty to the U.S. and his loyalty to his family members.  I find for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>
