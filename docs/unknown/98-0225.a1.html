<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued a decision dated August 19, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated April 9, 1998 to Applicant.  The
SOR was based on Criteria J (Criminal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior) and G (Alcohol Consumption).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on July 9, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision on August 19, 1998
in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary capricious or contrary to law?</U> <A HREF="98-0225.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>
Applicant does not challenge any specific findings of fact or conclusions of law from the Administrative Judge's decision
below.  Applicant's brief focuses on his current situation and requests that the Board grant him a security clearance in light
of the positive aspects he has presented.  The Board construes Applicant's brief as arguing that the Administrative Judge's
decision below was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Regarding Applicant's criminal conduct and sexual behavior,  Applicant notes that his arrest took place almost three years
ago.  Applicant also notes that his daughter returned to his home in January 1998 and there have been no additional
incidents.  He also notes that both he and his daughter are in counseling.<A HREF="98-0225.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  The Board construes Applicant's points
collectively as arguing either that the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions under these criteria were not
rationally justified by the record evidence or that the Administrative Judge did not reasonably weigh the record evidence. 
The Board is not persuaded by Applicant's points.  The fact that a party may be able to draw upon record evidence to
support their interpretation of the situation does not invalidate the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions.  In
this case, there was ample record evidence to support the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions as to the
disqualifying nature of Applicant's history of criminal conduct and sexual behavior.  A review of the record evidence as a
whole persuades the Board that Administrative Judge weighed the evidence in a reasonable manner and that his findings
and conclusions reflect a plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0055 (December 31,
1998) at page 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant addresses Criterion G by pointing out that he has "been sober for over 2 years now" and is "currently attending
AA meetings."  The Board construes Applicant as saying that his track record on alcohol consumption does not justify the
Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions under this criterion.  The Board agrees with Applicant's argument, in part
because the Administrative Judge himself concluded that Applicant is not likely to abuse alcohol in the future.  The Board
is unable to reconcile the Administrative Judge's findings that Applicant "has not consumed alcohol for two years" and "is
not likely to abuse alcohol in the future" with his adverse conclusion under Criterion G.  The Administrative Judge's
inconsistent findings and conclusions under Criterion G constitute error.  However, the ultimate outcome of the case is
unchanged as the adverse conclusions under Criteria J and D remain intact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating harmful error.  Accordingly the Board affirms the
Administrative Judge's August 19, 1998 decision.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>The Administrative Judge also entered a formal finding for Applicant with respect to SOR allegation 3.a.  That formal
finding is not at issue on appeal and need not be addressed by the Board.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant also asserts that his daughter was released from state custody on the day of his hearing.  That information was
not contained in the record evidence.  Applicant's assertion is thus new evidence.  The Board may not consider new
evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional procedure Guidance, Item 29.
