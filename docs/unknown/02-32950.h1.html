<P>Applicant was convicted of driving an automobile while intoxicated in February 1984 and again in September 1993. He has remained sober and not received 
any traffic citations since the 1993 conviction. Applicant  has mitigated the security concerns that arose from his alcohol consumption. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the 
administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant submitted an 
answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on October 15, 2003, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted some, but not all, SOR allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on November 21, 2003. A notice of hearing was issued on January 14, 2004, scheduling the hearing for January 29, 2004. 
Applicant was unprepared to proceed on the scheduled hearing date, having received insufficient advance notice of the hearing date, and the hearing was 
cancelled. A new notice of hearing was issued on January 30, 2004, rescheduling the hearing for February 20, 2004. The hearing was conducted as rescheduled. 
The government submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without an objection. 
The Applicant testified and submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-8. AE 1-7 were admitted into the record 
without an objection. Upon being questioned, Applicant conceded that AE 8 was irrelevant and that document was not admitted into the record. The transcript 
was received February 26, 2004.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel conceded prior to the hearing that the SOR allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.b., and 2.a., were mitigated based upon his pre 
hearing review of AE 1. That document does establish those allegations have been mitigated. During the hearing, Department Counsel conceded that SOR 
subparagraph 2.b. had also been mitigated, and there was no Guideline E security concern. Subparagraph 2.b. alleged that Applicant had answered "No" to 
question 24 in GE 1, although a review of that document discloses he actually answered "Yes" and listed one of his two alcohol driving offenses. Department 
Counsel conceded the disclosure of the one arrest evidenced that there was no intent on the part of Applicant to falsify GE 1. I fully concur with Department 
Counsel's analysis of the evidence and his concessions, and will not further discuss the Guideline E allegations in this opinion.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 55 years old and has been employed as a test truck driver for a defense contractor since March 2002. He previously was self-employed as a truck 
driver from May 1998 to March 2002.  Prior to that he was employed as a carpenter from May 1993 to May 1998. He was first married in June 1971, but that 
marriage ended in divorce in February 1981. He has been married to his present wife since March 1982. They have three children, ages 19, 15 and 10. His 
oldest child is a student at an Ivy League college, and the other two children live at home with Applicant and his wife, in a residence they have occupied since 
1989.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) on February 22, 1984.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> A fine was imposed upon him based upon this conviction. 
(GE 2) Additionally, his driving privileges were suspended, but the suspension was withdrawn on July 31, 1984. (AE 1)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Driving/Attempting to Drive While Intoxicated (DWI) on September 17, 1993. (AE 1) He was required to attend alcohol and 
victim's awareness classes and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as a result of this conviction. (GE 2) He successfully completed the classes and attended 
approximately two AA meetings a week for one year. Once again his driving privileges were suspended and that suspension was withdrawn on May 19, 1994. 
(AE 1) Additionally, Applicant had an alcohol restriction placed on his license that prevented him from being in a vehicle with a person who had been drinking 
alcohol or himself transporting alcohol in a vehicle. That restriction on his license was removed on January 21, 1997. (AE 1)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having considered Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and the substance of his testimony, I find his explanations concerning his alcohol consumption to be 
totally credible. He has not been intoxicated since his conviction for DWI in 1993. He does still drink beer, but no other type of liquor, and in recent time has 
not been in a tavern. He at times consumes as much as six beers per week, generally in the summer months when he is doing yard work and such around his 
house. He also will go weeks without consuming any alcohol. He has not operated a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol since the 1993 conviction. He was 
working at a boy scout event on July 4, 2002, consumed only a couple of beers during the day, and did not become intoxicated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted  letters of recommendation from supervisors at his place of employment, a memorandum of appreciation, and certificates of achievement 
and training completion that all attest to his dependability, trustworthiness, and overall excellent employment reputation. He has been issued a commercial 
driver's license, and has not received a traffic ticket since his 1993 DWI conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G, 
pertaining to alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-32950.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has twice been convicted of alcohol related driving offenses that resulted in the suspension of his driving privileges and mandated his attendance at 
AA meetings and alcohol and victim's awareness classes. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while 
under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's two convictions occurred almost ten years apart, and the last conviction was in September 1993. Since the last conviction he has maintained 
sobriety at all times and has not received a single traffic citation. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>; MC 2: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM> 
apply in this case. Guideline G is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. As indicated previously, Department Counsel, having considered  all the evidence, properly 
conceded there were no Guideline E issues in this case. I fully concur with his assessment of the evidence. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden 
of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
