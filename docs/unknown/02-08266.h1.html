U.S. citizen children, one brother residing in the U.S. (a citizen of India), and parents, parents-in-law, and two other siblings (all citizens and residents of India),

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated March 28, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to another Administrative Judge on April 21, 2003, but, due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge 
on June 4, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 4, 2003, and the hearing was held before me on June 26, 2003.  During the course of the hearing, 
including an authorized period following the hearing, two Government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the 
Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 1, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the proceeding, under Rule 201(b)(2), Federal Rules of Evidence, Department Counsel requested that Official Notice be taken of certain adjudicative 
facts as set forth in two documents furnished for consideration.  There being no objection interposed by Applicant, Official Notice was taken of the Annual 
Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage--2000, prepared by the National Counterintelligence Center, consisting of 17 
pages; and a </SPAN>passport policy "clarification" memorandum issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant was born in 1962 in India--a nation whose interests are not inimical to the United States.  Over the next 26 years, while residing with his family, he 
exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of India.  In 1988 he moved to the United States under a student visa to 
pursue a master's degree.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He received his M.S.I.E. from a university in the United States in May 1992.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  While obtaining his education, as well as thereafter, 
Applicant was employed in a variety of positions in the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant married an Indian citizen in February 1994, in India.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He applied for U.S. citizenship in 1995.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In late 1996 and late 1998, while employed in the 
United States, Applicant used his Indian passport when he took two pleasure trips back to India.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He used it again in 1997 when he took a business trip to 
Europe.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Upon completing the required immigration and naturalization citizenship process, both he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in 
September 2000.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Since becoming an American citizen, Applicant has exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of the United States.  He 
obtained, and used, a United States passport when he returned to India for a family reunion in 2001.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Conversely, Applicant has not accepted any benefits 
from India.</P>

after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  He did so because when he inquired of a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer what he should 
do with the Indian passport, he was told he could keep it as a souvenir as it was no longer valid.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  When the security clearance concerns herein were raised, he 
took the passport to a "notary officer" who advised him to simply "void" the Indian passport.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Upon becoming aware of proper surrender procedures, he 
mailed the Indian passport to the Indian Consulate General via certified mail<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> with a letter of transmittal indicating he was surrendering it because he is now a 
naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE:</STRONG>  <STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to both adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, on August 16, 2000, ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I issued a passport policy clarification pertaining to Adjudicative Guideline C--foreign preference.  I have taken 
Official Notice of the memorandum which states, in pertinent part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The 
guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to 
the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigating factor addresses 
the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this guideline are that the possession and use 
of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also 
facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  <STRONG><EM>Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked 
unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government. </EM></STRONG> 
odification of the Guideline is not required.  (Emphasis supplied)</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline C, the government has superficially established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who failed to formally surrender 
his Indian passport and acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country--in this instance, India--over the United States, and in so doing, he 
may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  However, there is evidence of only one 
citizenship, that of the U.S., with no evidence of any <EM>current active</EM> exercise of, or preference for, foreign citizenship, much less dual citizenship, other than the 
recent possession of the foreign passport, which he has since surrendered in a manner consistent with DoD policy.  In my estimation, Applicant's status in this 
regard technically falls within foreign preference disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.2. (<EM>possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>), but Applicant also 
seemingly enjoys the benefit of foreign preference mitigating condition (MC) E2.A3.1.3.1. (<EM>dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a 
foreign country</EM>); MC E2.A3.1.3.2 (<EM>indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States 
citizenship</EM>); and MC E2.A3.1.3.4. (<EM>individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>).  Also supporting Applicant are the following 
adjudicative process factors E2.2.1.2. (<EM>the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</EM>); E2.2.1.5. (<EM>the voluntariness of 
participation</EM>); and E2.2.1.7. (<EM>the motivation for the conduct</EM>).  Applicant had no intention of ever using the Indian passport and only kept it upon the erroneous 
advice of an official of the U.S. government--an INS officer--who advised him keep it as a souvenir as it was no longer valid.  Applicant's contentions in this 
regard are unrebutted, and it appears his action in keeping the Indian passport were innocent and involuntary and based on erroneous advice.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, in August 2000, ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I issued a passport policy clarification.  The declared intent of the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo was "to clarify the application of 
Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  In this instance, Applicant never used the passport after he was 
naturalized.  The ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo further states there are no mitigating factors "related to an applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign 
law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I construe to relate solely to the use of a foreign passport, and not to mere possession of same.  On 
the other hand, the memo states "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport. . . ."  In my view, Applicant has already "surrendered" the passport with no intent to renew it.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through 
evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline C.  Accordingly, allegation 1.a. 
of the SOR is concluded in favor of Applicant</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because 
members of his immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, Applicant's parents, his parents-in-law, and his three siblings--are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  This situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  In support of its contentions, the 
government has cited the fact Applicant's parents, parents-in-law, and siblings are citizens of India (and one of those siblings resides in the U.S.).</P> 
 
<P>Based on my review of the evidence, I conclude the security concerns manifested by the Government, in this instance, are largely unfounded.  The citizenship 
and residency status of Applicant's family members, standing alone, is sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying 
under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, Applicant's father is a semi-retired entrepreneur, industrialist, businessman who has his own business; his father-in-law is now retired, after 
having served as an engineering manager with a state-owned thermal power plant; one brother is a software engineer working for a private Indian company; 
another brother resides in the U.S. and has applied for U.S. citizenship; and all the women in the family are homemakers.  The evidence indicates they are not 
involved in any "intelligence work" for the Indian government, and they have no "official ties" to the Indian government.  Applicant also has a wife who is a 
naturalized citizen of the U.S. and two native-born U.S. citizen children, all of whom reside with him in the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>India is a friendly democracy which is not hostile to the United States, and its interests are not inimical to the U.S.  There is, however, some concern because 
India has been identified as one of those countries which practices industrial espionage and is an "active collector" of foreign economic information.<A HREF="02-08266.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  That 
concern is diminished, in this instance, because Applicant does not work in any of the critical technologies supposedly targeted by active collector nations.  
Furthermore, the government has offered no evidence to indicate a heightened level collection activities in Applicant's area of expertise.  These facts, when 
considered in light of the nature of the government in India, facilitate an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set 
forth therein.</P> 
 
<P>The residence and citizenship of Applicant's family members are clearly of security concern under foreign influence disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. 
(<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country</EM>).</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power in a position to 
be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>), as well as 
C E2.A2.1.3.5. </SPAN>(<EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the citizenship and 
residency status of Applicant's wife and children, I do not consider them to constitute unacceptable security risks.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through
