  Applicant's drug abuse can be mitigated as his LSD and mushroom use is dated; his marijuana use ended in May 1995 before he joined his employer and for the past eighteen months he was demonstrated he will not use drugs in the future. While he falsified his drug abuse history on a security questionnaire in  August 1995, he subsequently revealed all drug use and purchases to a DIS investigator voluntarily and before being confronted; additional interviews  developed no significant inconsistent information.  Thus, his criminal conduct with respect to the NAQ is isolated and will not recur.  Clearance granted.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 23, 1996.  (Copy attached.)  The
SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="96-0698.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  The SOR consists of allegations based on Criterion H (improper or illegal involvement with drugs) in
paragraph 1, Criterion E (questionable judgment) in paragraph 2, and Criterion J (pattern of criminal activity) in paragraph 3.  Applicant through counsel
responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR in a written Answer dated October 17, 1996, and chose to have a hearing.  </P>

<P>Initially, this matter was assigned to me on November 18, 1996, but then reassigned to another judge on November 21, 1996, and reassigned again to me on
January 17, 1997.  On January 23, 1997, I set this case for hearing on February 19, 1997, the date the hearing was held.  At this hearing the Government called
two witnesses and introduced five government exhibits (GE).  Applicant's counsel called the Applicant as a witness but introduced no exhibits.  The transcript
(TR) was received on March 5, 1997.</P>

<P>It is my role as administrative judge to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  </P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant admitted in his Answer <A NAME="admitted or denied subparas.?"></A>none of the factual allegations contained in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>Applicant, a 24-year old employee of a defense contractor, began work there in July 1995 as a --------------; he ------------------------------ for -----------------------. 
He seeks a secret security clearance.  TR 70, 72. </P>

<P>Applicant completed and signed a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) on August 10, 1995, where he answered questions 20.a. about drug use by detailing
his use of "pot" less than ten times (10/90, 11/90, 6/91,  7/91, 6/92, 7/93, and 9/94) and listed one time only use of LSD.  He answered 20.b. about drug
purchase, "No."  He signed a certification that the entries were "true, complete, and accurate" over an advisement that "a knowing and willful false statement on
this form" would be subject to U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001 penalties.  GE 1; TR 85-87.  </P>

<P>He subsequently was interviewed by DIS Special Agent #1 on December 29, 1995, who based his interview on an electronically submitted NAQ not in evidence
but identified as GE 6.  TR 40-41.  </P>

<P>Without being confronted Applicant voluntarily detailed his drug use to Agent #1 which was more extensive that he had listed on his NAQ.  His marijuana use 
began in high school in fall 1989; then he had used marijuana on approximately 24 occasions.  He also admitted purchasing marijuana during his senior year
once, but he would contribute to purchase on other occasions.  However, he never purchased marijuana in college.  During college he smoked marijuana
approximately sixteen times and continued even after his December 1994 graduation when he used it three to four times when he worked at a restaurant.  His
last use of marijuana was at a concert in May 1995, but he stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.  He used LSD on two occasions in college and
purchased it both times for a total cost of $25.  He also tried psilocybin mushrooms on three occasions in college.  Applicant maintained that the limited use he
listed on his NAQ was "to the best of my recollection."  He explained that on his NAQ he listed only the times he "really got high and left out the times I just
took a puff."  He forgot to list his use of mushrooms.  He did not list his drug purchases because he was afraid he would not get a security clearance.  GE 2; TR
21-24; 29-31; 41-43; 71.</P>

<P>Later Agent #1 conducted a second interview with Applicant again on January 5, 1996, after a former roommate had provided discrepant information regarding
his later use of drugs.  While Agent #1 confronted him, Applicant denied these allegations that he used marijuana three or four times from May to August 1995. 
GE 3; TR 24-28; 71.</P>

<P>When he was interviewed by Agent #2, a senior investigator/polygraph examiner, five months later on June 11, 1996, he stated he did not know when he used
marijuana last as he had friends who use marijuana at parties including one he attended with his girlfriend on June 9, 1996.  GE 4.  He admitted using marijuana
from 1989 to May 1995 from as much as three times a month to twice a year and to using LSD three or four times in 1990.  While he initially still maintained
that he had not used any illegal drugs after May 1995, he later said he was not able to say exactly when his last use occurred.  GE 5; TR 45-57;58-64; 64-65.</P>

<P>I accept his clarification at the hearing that his last use of marijuana was definitely May 1995 as I find credible his explanation that the reason he was unsure
with Agent #2 over his last use was that he was very nervous and confused about her questions and the exact date of the concert.  TR 72-73; 92-93, 94-96, 99-100.  While the party on June 9, 1996, was for his girlfriend, I accept his explanation that he did not smoke marijuana that evening and has not used marijuana
since he joined the defense contractor in July 1995, and he has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future.  He has not used LSD since 1990.  TR 74-77.  I also
find credible his explanation that with respect to purchases he forgot about the purchases or "misconstrued what purchase meant on the questionnaire" as he did
not realize that contributing towards purchase was considered a purchase.  TR 78-79; 87-89.</P>

<P>.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an
individual's access to classified information.   But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion H: Drug Involvement</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>(a)  drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>(1)  any drug abuse (see above definition); </P>

<P>(2)  illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; </P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>(1)  the drug involvement was not recent;</P>

<P>(3)  a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion E:  Personal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></P>

<P>(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </P>

<P> <STRONG> Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>(2) the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</P>

<P>(3) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts;</P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion J:  Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>  (1)  any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>(2)  the crime was an isolated incident.</P>

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate  to overcome the doubts raised by the
Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  </P>

<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </P>

<P><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion H: Drug Involvement</STRONG></P>

<P>The Government established its case with regard to Drug Involvement (Criterion H) as Applicant did use marijuana from 1989 through May 1995, LSD in 1990,
and mushrooms in college.  He at times had contributed to the purchase of marijuana and also purchased marijuana in high school and  LSD in college.  This
drug use and purchases raise a serious security concern that may be disqualifying which include:  (1) any drug abuse; and  (2) illegal drug possession, including
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.  While Applicant was not a regular user of drugs, his use was more than experimental.</P>

<P>On the other hand in reviewing the evidence in mitigation I find credible his testimony that he did not continue to use drugs after he began work at a defense
contractor in July 1995 and accordingly find that he does fall within mitigating condition (1), that his drug involvement was not  recent and (2), that he has
demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future as at the time of the hearing he had been drug free for more than eighteen months.   </P>

<P>While there were SOR allegations of drug use beyond May 1995, they were never established through his admissions or other evidence.  Indeed, while he was
ambiguous in his statements about his drug use to DIS Agent #2 when he stated he did not know when he used marijuana last and while his association with
friends who use marijuana at parties is not to his credit, the only clear admission of additional drug use established by Agent #2 was his admission of an
additional use of LSD in 1990, which is now dated.  Given the extensive and complex nature of the interview of over four hours with Agent #2, I find credible
Applicant's explanation that his statement to Agent #2 was incoherent because he was nervous and confused both by her questions and by not being able to
remember then the exact date of the concert where he remembers he last used marijuana.  </P>

<P>At the hearing, he was clear that he had not used any drugs after he had joined the staff of the defense contractor in July 1995.  While his credibility is hurt by
his having understated his drug use and omitted any purchases on his NAQ, his credibility is helped by the extensive details he provided voluntarily and without
confrontation to Agent #1 in the initial interview.  Thus, I find eighteen months is enough time to have passed for Applicant to have manifested his intent to
remain drug-free.  I have also considered the Adjudicative Process factors, and I find for the Applicant under Paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b, 1.c., 1.d,
1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.</P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion E:  Personal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P>Notably, Applicant's drug use was understated on his National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) and he denied any drug purchases even though he signed a
certificate that his answers were "true, complete, and accurate."  By withholding relevant and material information about his drug use and purchases on his
NAQ, his conduct falls within conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying as he deliberately omitted, concealed, or falsified relevant
and material facts from his personnel security questionnaire when he had an obligation to be truthful.  </P>

<P>On the other hand in considering factors that are mitigating, Applicant did not minimize his past drug use and drug purchases to DIS Agent #1.  At this
interview with DIS Agent #1 he disclosed almost all his drug usage (save one later additional use of LSD revealed to Agent #2), and he detailed his drug
purchases in full.  The only significant ambiguity that later developed in the security investigation concerned the date of his last use of drugs as there was an
allegation that he continued to use marijuana beyond May 1995.  However, he clearly denied this use to Agent #1 in this second interview.  </P>

<P>His interview with DIS agent #2 which took place several months later and took four and a half hours resulted in a confused Statement that could best be
described as incoherent.  I accept as credible his explanation that he was confused only about the date of the concert where he had last used marijuana and that
he did not mean that his initial statement to Agent #1 was false.  Even the Certified Result of Interview prepared by Agent #2 does not establish any significant
recent drug use beyond his May 1995 marijuana use that he had freely admitted to Agent #1.  </P>

<P>While ideally he should have revealed his drug use and purchases in full on his NAQ, I find credible his explanation that he did not understand fully what was
meant by purchases.  I do so based on the fact that in his initial interview he voluntarily detailed his high school purchases of marijuana and his minimal college
purchases of LSD.  Indeed Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the NAQ omissions before being confronted with the facts. In Agent #1's
testimony he did not reveal that he had any independent information with which to confront Applicant at the time of the initial interview.  When Agent #1 did
later develop some adverse allegations about Applicant's continuing use of marijuana, Applicant denied it and the Agent #1 had no further evidence to establish
such use.  (The Government did not call as a witness the individual who stated his use continued beyond May 1995.)  While the Applicant did reveal one more
use of LSD to Agent #2 than he had to Agent #1, I do not find that this limited factual development was sufficient to establish the government's case that he falls
within Criterion E's disqualifying condition (3): "deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness
determination."</P>

<P>Thus, having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and facts, I conclude that while the Government established its case
with regard to personal conduct, Criterion E, in part with respect to his NAQ, Applicant's conduct can be mitigated as he voluntarily revealed his drug use and
purchases to Agent #1 in his initial interview and made a prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with these facts in his
initial interview.  These factors together provide a basis for mitigation.  Thus, after also considering the Adjudicative Process factors, I find for the Applicant
under Paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a., 2.a. (1), 2.a.(2),  2.b., 2.b.(1), 2.c, 2.c. (1), 2.d, and d.(1).</P>

<P><STRONG>Criterion J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P>The Government established its case with regard to criminal conduct, Criterion J, as  Applicant did misrepresent his answers to the NAQ by minimizing his past
drug use and denying any drug purchases and consequently did mislead the Government on his NAQ.  Thus, he falls within a condition that could raise a
security concern and may be disqualifying over his incomplete answers to the NAQ.  However, even concluding  that his NAQ omissions constituted criminal
conduct (regardless of whether the person was formally charged), his conduct can be mitigated if it is found to be of an isolated nature.  Indeed, the only
information in evidence about the Applicant's drug use and purchases came from the Applicant himself.  While I do not fully accept Applicant's defense that he
did not intend to falsify his NAQ,  I do conclude that his initial omissions on the NAQ were not followed by repeated and willful falsifications at the interview
stage.  </P>

<P>Thus based on my credibility assessments, I do not find that the conduct will recur.  Supporting my credibility assessment is that fact that he fully revealed all
details of his drug use (save one 1990 LSD use) and purchases when these questions were clarified and asked again by DIS Agent #1 in his initial interview, as
discussed above.   DIS Agent #2 developed no significant inconsistent information from what he voluntarily revealed in this first interview.  While his June 11,
1996, Statement to DIS Agent #2 suggests that his first statement was "false" because he knew that there was "a possibility of them not being true," at the
hearing he said he could not explain what he meant by those words.  While on that date he could not remember the date of his last use of marijuana, I found
credible his explanation that his confusion was over the exact date of the concert where he last used.  There is no evidence beyond this confusion on his part
after a long interview, that he intended to falsify his most recent marijuana use to either DIS Agent #1 or #2.  I accept as credible his testimony that his last use
was in May 1995 as consistent with his initial interview with Agent #1; there is no other inconsistent evidence on his last use. </P>

<P>Consequently, after also considering the Adjudicative Process factors, I find for the Applicant under Paragraph 3 and subparagraph 3.a.</P>

<P><A NAME="F.3 Directive analysis"></A><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></P>

<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
