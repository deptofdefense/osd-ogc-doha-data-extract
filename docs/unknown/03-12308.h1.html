  Applicant has mitigated security concerns over his criminal conduct which began when he was arrested at 19 in 1984 and continued unbroken for five years until 1989; however, after he married in 1996 and began work for a defense contractor, he found his life's purpose and began his efforts at rehabilitation.

<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns over his criminal conduct which began when he was arrested at 19 in 1984 and continued unbroken for five years 
until 1989; however, after he married in 1996 and began work for a defense contractor, he found his life's purpose and began his efforts at rehabilitation.  While 
he had two more arrests in 1998, his subsequent record has been unblemished.  While in his twenties he was sentenced to serve more than one year of 
confinement, in fact, each time he served substantially less than one year.  Thus, the Smith provision as amended in 2004 (10 U.S.C. Section 986) no longer 
disqualifies him as  he was never incarcerated for more than one year.  As he has led a responsible and productive life for a significant period after release from 
confinement, clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on January 21, 2004. The SOR detailed reasons<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant. The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J), including an allegation that his criminal conduct 
disqualifies Applicant from having a security clearance because of 10 U.S.C. Section 986, unless in a meritorious case the Secretary of Defense authorizes an 
exception. Applicant responded to the SOR in an Answer notarized on February 9, 2004, where he requested a hearing and a waiver.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on June 10, 2004, attested it was ready to proceed; the case was assigned to me on June 17, 2004. 
Subsequently, a Notice of Hearing issued on June 24, 2004, set the matter for July 14, 2004, at a location near where Applicant works and lives. At the hearing 
the Government introduced seventeen exhibits which were all admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-17); Exhibit 15 was admitted over Applicant's objection.  (TR 
14-20) Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of Section 986 of Title 10, United States Code.  (Exhibit I)  (TR 13-14)  Applicant 
testified and offered three exhibits which were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits A - C) The transcript (TR) was received on July 28, 2004.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After the hearing, on October 9, 2004,Congress amended 10 U.S.C. 986, a statute relevant to a decision in this case.  Subsequently on December 14, 2004, 
DOHA was advised of a moratorium established on all cases involving 10 U.S.C. 986 matters and DOHA administrative judges were directed to take no action 
on pending cases until receipt of further guidance.  While no guidance was issued, on August 3, 2005, DOHA was advised that the moratorium was no longer in 
effect.  </SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant, 38 years old, has been employed with a Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 since September 1996. Subsequently, the contract was awarded to Defense 
Contractor #2 in January 2000; however he essentially remained in the same position doing the same job.  He currently makes $40,000 annually as a technician.  
(Exhibit 1; TR 48-52)  He completed his Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86) in January 1998.   (Exhibit 1)  Applicant was married in March 
1996.  (Exhibit 1)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct </STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On his SF 86 Applicant disclosed that he served one year in prison in State #2 in January 1984 for theft.  (Exhibit 1)  Applicant has had a series of arrests and 
convictions in three states from 1984 to 1998:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.a. When he was 19 years old, Applicant and a friend took the wheels off a totaled vehicle that had been sitting in a field; when he was putting the tires in 
his truck, he was arrested in State #2 in March 1984.  The arrest report valued the wheels at $400.  He was charged with Burglary of a Conveyance and Grand 
Larceny; in July 1984 he was sentenced to one year probation for Burglary; the prosecution of the Grand Larceny change was deferred.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 
4,10, 11, 12, 16, 17; TR 21-23, 33-34)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.b. Applicant admits he was arrested on May 19, 1985 in State #2 for violation of probation, not for Failure to Appear in relation to the prior Grand 
Larceny charge as reported in the FBI report.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 4, 17)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.c.   While Applicant denied his arrest on May 25, 1985 in B County in State #4 for Fraud-Insufficient Funds-Check, Failure to Appear in relation to 
Grand Larceny and Contempt of Court and was fined $150 for Contempt of Court, the state criminal history records substantiated this arrest and fine.  (Answer; 
Exhibits 2, 12, 13,17; TR 34-35; 39-41)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.d. Applicant admits he was arrested on July 3, 1985 in State #2 and charged with vehicle theft; the charge was dismissed when he established his 
ownership; he is attempting to expunge this charge.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 11, 13, 14, 16)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.e. Applicant denies he was arrested in October 21, 1985 in State #2 and charged with Buying/Receiving Stolen Property - Grand Theft and Failure to 
Appear in relation to a suspended or revoked driver's license where the charges were dismissed; he is attempting to expunge this charge.   The state criminal 
history and FBI records substantiate this arrest and show the charges dismissed.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 4)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.f. Applicant admits he was arrested on June 11 1986 in State #2 for Driving While Driver's License Suspended/Revoked; while he denies the Contemp 
of Court charge,  the state criminal history records substantiate this arrest and both charges.  (Answer; Exhibit 2)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.g., 1.h. In June 1986 his probation officer filed an Affidavit of Violation of Probation because of violation of conditions.  (Exhibit 11)  Applicant 
admitted he was re-arrested in State #2 in County I in July 3, 1986 and charged with Violation of Probation.  The FBI records support his testimony that after 
arrest in County I  he was turned over to another agency.  Applicant was transferred to and arrested in County B on July 9, 1986.  On August 25, 1986, he was 
sentenced to two years probation where he had to make daily reports. Again, he did not complete probation as he was working different jobs and moving.  
(Answer; Exhibits 2, 4, 11, 16, 17; TR 23-24; 41-43)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.i. In April 1987 a community control officer filed an Affidavit of Violation of Community Control which led to Applicant's re-arrest in State #2 in 
County B on July 3, 1987 and charge of Violation of Probation.  In December 1987 he was sentenced to one year and one day incarceration with 140 days' 
credit for time served for violating parole and unlawful use of driver's license.  Applicant attested he actually served 195 days incarcerated: "I spent six months, 
four and a half months of which I spent in the county jail waiting to go and then one and a half months in the actual prison system."  (Answer; Exhibits 2,  4, 
11, 15, 16; TR 24-27)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.j. Applicant denied this charge as he did not remember it;  but records establish he was arrested on July 21, 1987 in State #2 and charged with I Fraud-Obtaining Vehicle, II Forgery, and III Fraud-Unlawful Use of a Driver's License; he pled guilty to Count II and was sentenced to one year and one day 
incarceration with 142 days credit for time served, to be served concurrently with his previous sentence awarded in SOR 1.i.  (Answer; Exhibits 13, 14, 15; TR 
44)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.k. Applicant admitted he was arrested again in State #3 in January 1989 for Larceny over $250 after he took ski equipment from a dump when the ski 
company denied ever taking anything to the dump; he pled guilty<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of one year in jail with probation after three 
months.  (Answer; Exhibit 16)  The FBI reports in February 1989 he was sentenced to 364 days in the county jail with record to be reviewed in 90 days and 
probation to be considered; in March 1989 he was given ten months probation.  Applicant testified that, in fact, he was "released after three months." (Exhibits 
3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 17; TR 28-29)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.l. Applicant denied the arrest in 1.l. as it is the same offense as 1.k. He was sentenced to ten months probation in State #3 for the offense detailed in SOR 
1.k.  He had the probation transferred to State #1 and completed it. (Answer; Exhibit 4; TR 44-45)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.m. Applicant was arrested in January 1998<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> in State #1 for Theft of Check for an incident that happened in 1996; the charge was dismissed after he paid 
the amount due after he was arrested.  He explained that a customer had given him a bad check which in turn led to one of his checks for $599 being bad. 
(Answer; Exhibits 5, 8, 16; TR 31-32; TR 45-46; 51)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">SOR 1.n. Applicant admits he was arrested in State #1 in April 1998 for disorderly conduct and paid a bond of $147, but denies he was disorderly; he claims to 
have been upset when his mother was in an accident and not being treated properly by paramedics which led him to curse at a police officer.  (Answer; Exhibits 
5, 16; TR 29-31)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant had no arrests from 1989 to 1998.  (TR 45-47)  Since his last arrest in 1998 Applicant changed his life.  He began to focus on doing  his job and using 
his expertise to support the military.  (TR 37)  Since he married his wife in 1996 and found his job, he began to change his life as he found a purpose.  He has 
stepchildren and step-grandchildren as he married into a large family.  He now is financially stable with a net worth of $250,000.  Since 1998 he has had no 
violations of law.  (TR 47-48)</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant's direct supervisor, the site manager, reported that since 1996 Applicant has met customer needs superbly.  When needed, Appliant has also 
expedited  requests.  He has done his work with minimal guidance and direction. (TR 38; Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The military chief affirmed that Applicant has support his organization for four years.  He assessed Applicant's integrity and honesty as being above reproach.  
Applicant has shown initiative and enthusiasm.  The military chief assessed Applicant as having excellent technical expertise and being able to get "maximum 
production from the resources he was to work with.  His dedication, loyalty and courage is unsurpassed, and he sets high standards for himself and constantly 
exceeds them." Applicant plays a vital support role for the organization. (TR 38; Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In February 2003 Applicant received a Certificate of Appreciation for his work from December 2002 to January 2003. (TR 38-39; Exhibit B)  He also received 
a certificate of appreciation in December 2003.  (TR 39; Exhibit C)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATUTORY REQUIREMENT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A provision of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 ("The Smith Amendment"), mandates 
restrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances. This statutory limitation was implemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, 
emorandum, and within DOHA by Operating Instruction (OI) 64, issued on July 10, 2001. Statutory provision (1) disqualifies a person who "has been 
convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year." DoD implementing guidance interpreted 
this language to include "person with convictions in both State and Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses with sentences imposed of more than one year, 
regardless of the amount of time actually served." The Smith Amendment establishes authority for the Secretary of Defense (or the Secretary of the military 
department concerned) to grant a waiver where meritorious cases exist. This authority may not be delegated. Neither the statute, nor DoD, defined "meritorious 
circumstances."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">However, on October 9, 2004, portions of subsection (c)(1) of Section 986 of Title 10, United States Code were amended by Section 1062 of the Ronald W. 
Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 approved and adopted<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>and was incarcerated as a 
result of that sentence for not less than one year</EM>. [Emphasis supplied.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information. But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive. Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I applied relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Guideline J- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><EM>The Concern</EM>:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information. Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance. Under 
the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only 
after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, 
the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant mitigated security concerns over his criminal conduct which initially raised disqualifying<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> security concerns.  In 1984 he was first arrested at age 19 
in State #2 and he continued to have other multiple arrests and convictions in State #2 and later State #3 until 1989.  Even after Applicant moved to State #1 he 
was arrested again in 1998 on two minor charges.  While Applicant had several arrests where he was sentenced to serve more than one year, in fact, he never 
was required to serve a sentence of more than one year.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">As originally enacted the Smith Amendment restricted the granting or renewal of security clearances with a conviction in both State and Federal courts with a 
sentence imposed of more than one year, regardless of time actually served.  That provision changed when an amendment to 10 U.S.C. 986 was signed by the 
President on October 28, 2004 as part of the Defense Authorization Act: the first disqualifying provision of 10 U.S.C. 986 now reads: "(1) has been convicted in 
any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not 
less than one year."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">His first arrest in 1984 for removing $400 in tires from a vehicle led to him being given a sentence of one year of probation.  This arrest led to repeated 
subsequent arrests when he failed to complete probation because of his unstable life-style in his 20's.   In July 3, 1987, Applicant was charged with Violation of 
Probation and in December 1987 sentenced to one year and one day incarceration with 140 days credit for time served.  Applicant attested he actually served 
195 days incarcerated: "I spent six months, four and a half months of which I spent in the county jail waiting to go and then one and a half months in the actual 
prison system."  This period of incarceration falls within the 2004 amendment as he served less than one year imprisonment.  While Applicant pled guilty to 
Count II Forgery and was sentenced to one year and one day incarceration with 142 days credit for time served,  he served that term concurrently with his 
previous sentence awarded in SOR 1.i., discussed above.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant's second major arrest that led to security concerns was SOR 1.k. where Applicant admitted he was arrested again in January 1989 for Larceny over 
$250 after he claimed to have found ski equipment in the dump when the ski company denied ever taking anything to the dump.  After he pled guilty, he was 
sentenced to two consecutive sentences of one year in jail; however, he was granted probation after he served only three months. Again, this period of 
incarceration falls within the 2004 amendment as he served less than one year imprisonment.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In addition to establishing that the Smith prohibitions do not apply, Applicant demonstrated that he met conditions that mitigate<A HREF="03-12308.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> security concerns over his 
multiple arrests.  Significantly, he has been free of any criminal conduct since 1998, a seven year period.  Thus, under MC 1, the criminal behavior was not 
recent. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">To the extent financial instability led to his prior criminal conduct, he now is financially stable with a net worth of $250,000.  Thus, I  conclude under MC 4 
also that the factors leading to these repeat  violations are not likely to recur.  He now handles his responsibilities in a conscientious fashion according to the 
supervisors who praise his  work performance, and character.  Applicant has demonstrated his ability to lead a responsible and productive life for a significant 
period after conviction or release from confinement which is strong evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Thus, under MC 6, there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. After he married in 1996 and found his job, he changed as his life had purpose.  
Applicant documented he successfully completed his probation for serious charges in two states and paid fines for the lesser offenses.  Since 1998, Applicant 
demonstrated his rehabilitation and his ability to lead a responsible and productive life for a significant period after his release from confinement.  He has a 
history of employment stability and a reputation for excellence as a productive member of his company work force. Applicant obtained a job with the defense 
contracting company in 1996 where he has continuously worked effectively and achieved recognition for his contributions.  Both his civilian and military 
supervisors praise his superb work.  The military chief attested that Applicant has excellent technical expertise and has demonstrated loyalty and courage.  This 
supervisor assures that Applicant now sets high standards for himself and constantly exceeds his own standards.  Applicant plays a vital support role effectively.  
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After also considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o. incorporated 
under SOR Paragraph 1. </SPAN></P>
