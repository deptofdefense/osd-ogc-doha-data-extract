<P>Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows: (1) strike the introductory paragraph on page one and replace it with the paragraph below, and (2) in subparagraph 1.d strike "arrested" 
and replace with "issued a citation." In the absence of an objection, Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR is granted. The amended introductory paragraph on page one now reads:</P> 
 
<P>A review of your eligibility for occupying Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III to support a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) has been made pursuant to DoD 
Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992. This office recommends that your case be submitted to an Administrative Judge for a determination that you are not eligible for occupying such a position. 
This recommendation is based on the following reasons:</P> 
 
<P>Amended subparagraph 1.d now reads:</P> 
 
<P>You were issued a citation on May 23, 2003 in Madison, Wisconsin and charged with Possession of Marijuana or Cannabis in Public. You pled No Contest and were fined $100.00.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, 1.e and personal conduct under Guideline E, subparagraph 2.a. 
She denied the allegation pertaining to drug involvement, subparagraph 1.d. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the record, I make 
the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 21-year-old employee of a U.S. government contractor. She has worked for this contractor from August 2004 to present. She completed a SF 85P in November 2004 to continue her 
position as a customer service representative.</P> 
 
<P>From approximately February 2003 until at least June 2003, Applicant used marijuana daily. She also used marijuana one time in approximately July 2005.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant used opium on three to four occasions from approximately February 2003 until at least June 2003.</P> 
 
<P>From February 2003 until at least June 2003, Applicant used Vicadin, a prescription drug, without a prescription. Applicant stated: "[t]his was however Vicadin that was in my home that was from a 
prior prescription that I had and because of pain from a rib injury which I was prescribed Naproxan for I also took some Vicadin."<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She also stated: "In the past I have use [sic] marijuana, opium 
and prescription drugs that were not mine."<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>On May 23, 2003, Applicant was issued a citation and charged with possession of marijuana or cannabis in public. She pled no contest and was fined $100. In May 2003, Applicant tested positive 
for marijuana at a pre-employment drug test.</P> 
 
<P>On November 23, 2004, Applicant falsified material facts on her SF 85P, in response to Question 20 (Your Police Record:  In the past 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted 
of any offenses(s)?). Applicant failed to disclose that she was charged with possession of marijuana or cannabis in public. Applicant stated that this question was ambiguous and that she did not 
think that her citation was considered to be something that she was "charged with."</P> 
 
<P>Applicant started using drugs because of her depression.<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She is being treated by a psychiatrist, but not necessarily for her depression. She stated: ". . . I do not see my Psychiatrist as a need to work 
on depression but for getting my prescriptions (medications) for ADHD<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] and discuss problems I might be having."<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's usual setting for using drugs was at a friend's house or someone's vehicle.<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> She also explained: "I was using [drugs] because it helped me relax. I felt I became dependent and decided 
I needed to stop which I did. I don't see myself using drugs in the future."<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation. "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."<A HREF="06-11775.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline H, a trustworthiness concern exists for an individual who is improperly or illegally involved with drugs because it raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect sensitive information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functions, while increasing the risk of an authorized disclosure of sensitive information. Here, during the 
period from approximately February 2003 through June 2003, Applicant used marijuana daily, used opium on at least three occasions, and used Vicadin, a prescription drug without a prescription, 
approximately three times. Moreover, she used marijuana at least once in July 2005. She was issued a citation in May 2003 and charged with possession of marijuana in public. She also tested 
positive for marijuana during a pre-employment drug test. Consequently, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>any drug abuse</EM>) and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (<EM>illegal drug 
possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>) apply.</P> 
 
<P>Various conditions can mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from drug involvement. Here, Applicant, a 21-year-old, stated she was depressed and chose to satisfy her depression by using illegal 
drugs. She used marijuana on a daily basis from February 2003 until June 2003 and at least once in July 2005. Opium and Vicadin were used by her at least three times during the same four-month 
period. Moreover, she was issued a citation in May 2003 and charged with possession of marijuana in public and she failed a pre-employment drug screening as well, as marijuana was found in her 
urine. Based on the 2005 use of marijuana, I conclude that her drug involvement was recent. I conclude that Applicant's drug involvement was not an isolated or aberrational event because she used 
three distinct illegal drugs numerous times. Applicant does not plan on using illegal drugs in the future. However, not enough time has elapsed for Applicant to prove that she will restrain from 
using illegal drugs in the future. Thus, Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>), DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (<EM>the drug involvement was an 
isolated or aberrational event)</EM>, and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>) do not apply.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question of a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
sensitive information. Applicant deliberately falsified a material fact on her SF 85P when she failed to disclose that she was issued a citation and charged with possession of marijuana in public. 
Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies. None of the enumerated Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in this case. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant was 
self-medicating by using illegal drugs for a condition she called depression. Applicant should have relied on the assistance of her psychiatrist to get her condition under control and not randomly use 
illegal drugs. Under these circumstances, Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case under the pertinent drug involvement and personal conduct guidelines. Accordingly, I conclude that it is 
not consistent with the national interest to grant a favorable trustworthiness determination to Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>
