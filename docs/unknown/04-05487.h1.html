<P>Applicant, a 25-year-old employee of a security services firm, failed to mitigate multiple driving offenses some involving alcohol between 1997 and 2003 as 
well as drug use between 1992 and 1998. He did mitigate two personal conduct allegations concerning failure to list all of the many driving and drug offenses 
since he did list two on his SF86 and his drug use on his SF 86 questionnaire. He failed to mitigate two other allegations of personal conduct. Clearance is 
denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On July 18, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on September 29, 2005. A notice of 
hearing was issued on November 8, 2005, for a hearing on November 29, 2005, and held that day. The government offered 13 exhibits into evidence and 
Applicant offered one. All were accepted. One witness testified for Applicant who also testified. The transcript was received on December 8, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all but one of the 19 specific SOR allegations concerning criminal conduct. He denied the allegations concerning personal conduct. The 
government conceded that the one allegation he denied (SOR &para; 1.c.) was a duplication of another allegation. After a complete review of the record, I make the 
following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor performing security services. He has a long record of traffic and driving arrests and charges, some 
of them involving alcohol, between 1998 and 2003. One arrest in 1999 was for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He was convicted only on the 
second charge. In addition, he has had three other violations for speeding and reckless driving since the SOR was issued. He was on probation for driving 
violations at the time of the hearing.</P> 
<P>Except for listing two offenses, Applicant did not list all of the charges in answer to Question 24 on his SF 86 relating to his police record for alcohol/drug 
offenses as he was required to do. He stated he had forgotten many of the incidents involving driving violations and that caused him to omit them on his SF 86. 
He also failed to list four offenses at Question 26 on other offenses resulting fines of $150.00 or more answering in the negative to the question. Three of those 
four charges were the most recent in 2002 and 2003. He also denied use of drugs in response to Question 27 relating to illegal use of drugs. He offered evidence 
(Exh. A) that he had reported the drug use on a draft SF 86 but listed the end date for drug use as 1996, outside the seven year window provided in the question, 
whereas it was 1998. </P> 
<P>Applicant was married recently and has a baby. Subsequently he sold a motorcycle and a sports car he drove when the various driving offenses occurred. He has 
vowed to change his driving habits and now owns only a van. He is well regarded in his work and is a reliable employee. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged both as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001 by failing to answer question 24 (SOR &para;2.a) and as to the conduct itself (SOR 
&para;2.b). The allegations could be mitigated if the criminal behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1), the crime was an isolated incident (E2.A10.1.3.2.), or there is 
clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). The intentions of Applicant to change his life style and driving habits are praiseworthy, and in view 
of his new family obligations, I believe he can change his conduct. However, the fact that he has had three driving offenses since the SOR was issued and is still 
on probation, it is premature to grant a clearance at this time. Proof of changed conduct over a greater period of time is required. No mitigating conditions 
apply. Only the one allegation of criminal conduct that is a duplicate of another one is mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to report his police record for alcohol/drug offenses at Question 24, his other offenses resulting in fines of $150.00 or more at Question 26, 
and his drug use at Question 27 on his SF 86 raises issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability,</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). 
Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security 
concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to Applicant's failure to report the full extent of his arrests and charges of traffic and driving violations, he offered a plausible explanation for not 
listing all alcohol/drug offenses in response to Question 24 in view of the vast number of them over such an extended time and the fact that he did list one 
alcohol and one drug offense. Thus, I find in his favor on the allegations concerning falsification relating to Question 24 on his SF 86. However, his failure to 
acknowledge other offenses at Question 26 resulting in fines of $150.00 or more when three of those offenses were the most recent of all his charges (two of 
them in the same year and only a few months before the SF 86 was filed) strains credulity and I find against him on that allegation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has shown in Exh. A that he listed on his questionnaire for national security positions the two drug use charges (SOR &para; 2.c.1.and 2.) but they did not 
appear on the final version of the SF 86 at Question 27 since he had given the concluding date of the activity as outside the seven year window requiring 
reporting which was inaccurate. He did report at Question 24 two 1999 offenses one of them involving the conviction for drug paraphernalia, one of his most 
serious offenses and the only one conviction involving drugs. The other was alcohol related. While the evidence could be interpreted as a wilful withholding, 
based upon his demeanor at the hearing, I accept his interpretation since he listed two of the offenses and alerted his security officer to his drug charges through 
information given on the questionnaire. Also alleged under personal conduct is his long record of arrests establishing a pattern of misconduct and I find against 
Applicant on that allegation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I conclude it is premature to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
