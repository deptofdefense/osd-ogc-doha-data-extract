<P>Applicant's long-standing indebtedness and her intentional falsification of material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SCA) preclude a finding that it is 
now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 18, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 1, 2005, and elected to have her case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case (FORM) on or about June 8, 2005. Applicant did not file a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to 
me on July 19, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 40 year old employee of a defense contractor.</P> 
<P>Applicant admits all of the factual allegations under Guideline F. Accordingly, SOR Paragraphs 1a through 1r are incorporated by reference as Findings of Fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant admits all of the factual allegations under Guideline E. Accordingly, SOR Paragraphs 2a, 2b and 2c are incorporated by reference as Findings of Fact.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>The evidence establishes that at the present time, applicant has at least 18 past-due debts totaling approximately $42,000.00, all of which have been either 
charged off or placed for collection. These facts require application of Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1<EM> (a history of not meeting financial obligations) </EM>and 
E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</EM></P> 
<P>In view of applicant's long and extensive history of financial difficulties, and the lack of any evidence that would suggest her financial condition is likely to 
significantly improve anytime soon, it is not now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information. No mitigating 
conditions are applicable. Based on the foregoing, Guideline F is found against applicant.</P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, applicant's falsification of material facts on the SCA is extremely troubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and 
integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security clearance application, 
it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. 
Applicant's intentional falsifications require application of Disqualifying Condition  E2.A5.1.2.2 <EM>(the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire  . . .)</EM>.  No Mitigating Conditions apply.  Based on the foregoing, Guideline E is found 
against applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for applicant.</P>
