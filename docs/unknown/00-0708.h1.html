<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 1, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 4, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on February 8, 2001.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on or about February 12, 2001, and submitted nothing in reply.  
This case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to the undersigned for resolution on December 17, 2001.  
The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alcohol consumption, and related personal and criminal conduct militate against the granting of a 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 41 years of age, 
and his employer seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.h.  The Applicant consumed alcohol with varying frequency, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 1978 until at 
least December 22, 2000 (Item 3).  The Applicant describes himself as "a social drinker . . . I usually drank beer, maybe a six pack on the 
evenings that I drank" (Item 5 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In <STRONG>January of 1990</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) (Item 5 at 
page 1, and Item 6 at pages 3 and 12).  The Applicant was separated from his former spouse from about January of 1995 to July of 1996 (Item 5 
at page 2).  His former spouse "considered . . . [his] drinking to be a large part of . . . [their] problems" (<EM>id</EM>).  In <STRONG>January of 1997</STRONG>, the Applicant 
was again arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, DUI (Item 5 at page 1, Item 6 at page 3, and Item 8 at page 2).  As a result of this second 
conviction, the Applicant underwent alcohol-related counseling, and was assessed as suffering from Alcohol Abuse (Item 5 at page 1).  He also 
separated from his former spouse a second time from about April of 1997 to April of 1998 (Item 5 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In <STRONG>June of 1998</STRONG>, was arrested, and subsequently pled No Contest to Fighting (Item 5 at page 2, Item 6 at pages 1~2, and Item 8 at page 3).  He 
"had been out drinking, and when . . . [he] returned home . . . [his] wife and . . . [the Applicant] got into an argument about . . . [his] drinking" 
(Item 5 at page 2).  Between late 1998 to early 1999, the Applicant reported to his place of employment, on more than one occasion, under the 
influence of alcohol (Item 5 at page 2).  He continues to consume alcohol (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 3.a.  In answering question 23.d. on his July 1998 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP), the Applicant knowingly and 
wilfully failed disclose his alcohol related conviction of 1997 (Item 4 at page 7).  This lack of candor is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little, if anything, in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; 
which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according 
to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, 
it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to 
evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting . . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in a n intoxicated or impaired condition . . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment; or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the 
relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption), E (personal conduct), and J (criminal conduct); which 
establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an 
applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational 
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that 
the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unacceptable personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations; and criminal conduct also creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  The Government must be able 
to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an 
applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude 
towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has demonstrated a history of alcohol abuse, as evidenced by three alcohol related convictions: one in 1990, another in 1997, and, 
most recently, one in 1998.  In 1997, he was assessed as suffering from Alcohol Abuse, and in 1998 and 1999 he reported to work under the 
influence of the intoxicant.  Despite all of the above, the Applicant still consumes alcohol.  His alcohol consumption is thus clearly of security 
concern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering next the Applicant's personal conduct and related criminal conduct, he failed to disclose the existence of his 1997 conviction on his 
1998 QNSP.  This wilful falsification of his QNSP is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  Both guidelines are therefore found against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his alcohol consumption, and his related personal and 
criminal conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E, G and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  
Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E, G and J.</SPAN></P>
