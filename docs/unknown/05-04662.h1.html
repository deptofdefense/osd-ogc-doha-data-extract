<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or 
denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated September 13, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (RSOR). He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On 
June 30, 2006, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to 
file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file a response to the FORM. The case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">June 25, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2006, but it was then reassigned to this Administrative Judge on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">October</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 12, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-10), which were admitted without objection.

Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Two Credit Reports, dated September 14, 2004, and November 8, 2005, establish that both of these debts were charged off and are still owed by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibits 5, 9)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his RSOR. Affidavit and Interrogatory Response, Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">contended that these debts were incurred fraudulently, in 1997 or 1998, without his knowledge, by his wife with whom he was still 
married but separated, at the time that the debts arose (Exhibits 2, 7, 8).  He averred that he did not believe he was responsible for these debts and therefore, he engaged the services of an attorney to try 
to resolve these debts, so that he would not be responsible for them. He was unsuccessful at this attempt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Since, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has contended that these debts arose in 1997 or 1998, and the SCA shows that he was married until </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">November</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 30, 1999,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> these debts were incurred while he was still married.

of this, he has been unable to avoid liability for the debts.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence 
or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as 
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a 
person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>              </STRONG>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish 
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such 
factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government 
raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States 
Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and his current non-payment of the debts listed on the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3., because of Applicant's history 
of not meeting financial obligations and his inability to satisfy his debts. Regarding Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3, which involves debts that result from circumstances beyond the person's 
control,  I find it applicable to this case, but not controlling. While Applicant's indebtedness was in large part due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">problems</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> of  Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> ex-wife's actions, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant's debts are substantial, and there has been no independent evidence introduced to establish that Applicant has made a good-faith attempt to resolve these debts, which are still 
due and owing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Until Applicant can make greater progress toward reducing or resolving these overdue debts, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F.  I resolve Guideline F against Applicant, and I 
conclude Applicant has not established, at this time, that it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" that he should be granted the privilege of a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
