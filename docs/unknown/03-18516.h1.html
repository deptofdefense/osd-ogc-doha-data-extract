<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old divorced father of three children, employed by a defense contractor since 2000. Applicant has been arrested and convicted of driving 
on a suspended drivers license numerous times and has been driving without insurance for at least 8 years. Applicant continues to drive on a suspended license 
and intends to do so in the future. Applicant had a history of financial difficulties and had his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1999. Applicant continues to 
have financial delinquencies. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his criminal conduct, financial concerns, and personal conduct. 
Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 19, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline F, financial concerns, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Applicant 
submitted a response to the SOR, dated May 17, 2004, and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant denied some allegations contained in the SOR, 
and admitted others while providing explanations in an effort to extenuate and mitigate the security concerns raised by the allegations.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on November 29, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on November 27, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 16, 2004. 
The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted nine exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-9. They were admitted 
without objection into the record. The Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted nine exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-9. 
All of Applicant's exhibits were admitted without objection. The transcript was received on January 4, 2005. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The government requested to amend the SOR, whereby allegation 3.a. should allege subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e. vice 1.a. through 1.e. There was no 
objection and the request was granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 31 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since 2000. He was recently promoted to warehouse production specialist. He is 
divorced and the father of three children, two from a marriage and one from a previous relationship. He pays child support for all three children. </P> 
<P>Applicant was unable to meet his financial obligations and filed for bankruptcy. He had approximately $9,319.00 in debt discharged in bankruptcy in April 
1999. Since that time Applicant has accumulated new debt. The table below presents details about Applicant's current debts, their current status, and cites to 
relevant parts of the record. </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. </P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a 
preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-18516.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F pertaining to financial considerations, Guidelines E, pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case. </P> 
<P>Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, under Guideline F, I find Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>, and DC 3:<EM> Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>, apply in this case. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and find none apply. Applicant had 
$9,319.00 of delinquent debt discharged in bankruptcy in 1999. Bankruptcy is a legitimate means to resolve overwhelming financial difficulties. Applicant has 
accumulated new debt since his bankruptcy. Applicant's explanations are, he is  unaware of the claims, he does not owe them, (but provided no proof of 
payment), they were discharged in bankruptcy (but provided no verification), or they are his ex-wife's debt (again, no proof or verification provided). Applicant 
does admit that two of the debts are delinquent and he has not paid them. Applicant took out a loan to partially satisfy his debt to the court system for fines he 
owes. </P> 
<P>Applicant's monthly expenses are greater than his monthly take home pay. After his bankruptcy, Applicant obtained numerous credit cards that he pays a 
minimum balance to each month. In spite of his bankruptcy and clean financial slate, Applicant's financial history continues to be troublesome. Applicant 
appears to be unaware of some of the outstanding claims against him, and those he is aware of he has not done anything to correct his financial record. 
Applicant offered no evidence that since his bankruptcy he has sought or obtained financial counseling. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P>Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, under Guideline J, I find DC 2:<EM> A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, </EM>applies. I have considered all the mitigating 
condition under Guideline J, and conclude none apply. Applicant had his driver's license suspended sometime before 1994, and has consistently and routinely 
broke the law since then, by driving on a suspended license and driving without insurance, among other infractions. Applicant readily admits he regularly drove 
on a suspended license for many years. Applicant has driven without insurance in violation of the law for minimally a period of eight years. Applicant has over 
a ten year history of driving on a suspended license, he continues to drive on a suspended license and testified he will continue to do so in the future. Applicant 
has consistently failed to pay the fines associated with his criminal activity. His failure to pay the fines imposed on him have contributed to his financial 
problems. Applicant has a total disregard for the rule of law and any appreciation for his requirement to obey it. Guideline J is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P>Personal Conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Personal conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P>Under Guideline E, DC 5:<EM> A pattern of dishonesty or rules violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual 
and the agency, </EM>applies. Applicant's history of criminal violations and his assertion that he will continue to violate the law raises a serious question regarding 
his judgment, trustworthiness and his unwillingness to comply with the rules and regulations. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under Guideline E 
and conclude none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P>In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their 
acts, omissions, motivations and various other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, 
and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in this case, including Applicant's appearance, demeanor and credibility while testifying. I have also considered him under 
the "whole person" concept. I am satisfied that Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case 
against him. Accordingly, Guidelines F, J and E are decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P>
