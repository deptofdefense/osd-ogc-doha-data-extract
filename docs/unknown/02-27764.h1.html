<P>After discharging over $21,000 in debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993, Applicant has continued to experience financial problems including a mobile 
home repossession, collection accounts and dwindling cash flow. She has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR, has accrued new delinquencies, and has 
not presented sufficient information to mitigate the resulting security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On November 10, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). 
The SOR informed Applicant that, based on available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>On March 3, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer), wherein she admitted all of the allegations and chose to have her case decided without a hearing. On 
June 2, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which 
Applicant received on June 11, 2004. Applicant timely responded to the FORM (Rebuttal) to which Department Counsel did not object. The case was assigned 
to me on July 6, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 52 years old and has been employed by the same defense contractor as a manufacturing specialist since November 1972. She is a single mother of 
two boys, ages 20 and 27. In April 1999, she submitted a security clearance application in which she disclosed that she had experienced financial problems.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> A 
subsequent background investigation revealed she has filed for bankruptcy, lost a mobile home to repossession, and has several delinquent credit accounts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.a) In 1993, Applicant broke her arm and was unable to work for six months. She fell behind in her financial obligations and had to declare bankruptcy. 
In June 1993, after one of her creditors obtained a judgment against Applicant, she filed a Chapter 7 petition and was eventually discharged of about $21,000.00 
in debts.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.d) In 1997, after her mother died, Applicant moved in with her father to help him through their loss. In the process, Applicant fell behind in her 
mortgage payments on a mobile home she had financed for about $40,000 in September 1995. She decided to return the mobile home to the dealer with a 
balance on the mortgage of about $37,000.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> While there is no available information about whether the property was resold or if Applicant owes a deficiency 
after any such resale, it must be assumed some financial obligation for this account remains. It is also clear, as Applicant told a Defense Security Service (DSS) 
agent two years ago, that she is unable to resolve this obligation.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.b) Applicant also owes about $320 for a delinquent credit card account which has been charged off by the creditor as a business loss. She claims this 
account was discharged through her 1993 bankruptcy under a different company name; however, she has not provided documentation to support her claim. This 
debt remains unpaid.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.c) Applicant also owes $260 for a delinquent cable TV account. In 1999, she told   DSS she intended to pay this bill; however, there is no information 
showing she has done so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 1.e) Applicant has continued to struggle with her finances since her last interview with DSS in 2002. Her 1999 Personal Financial Statement (PFS) 
showed she had about $400 left over each month after expenses, yet, in 2002, her PFS showed she only had about $90 each month. Applicant relies from time 
to time on her sons to help with household finances, but she has three accounts not alleged in the SOR that are either late, in collection, or have been charged 
off.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of all of available relevant and material 
information, and application of the pertinent factors and criteria provided in Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Further, the Administrative Judge must consider as 
appropriate the "whole person" factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not 
determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against 
them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having 
reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed in the Directive under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one 
has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline F, a security concern exists where it is shown </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an individual is financially overextended, thus being at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An inability or unwillingness to pay one's debts and to manage one's finances in a reasonably sound manner may also indicate poor judgment 
and reliability. Department Counsel has presented sufficient evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and I 
conclude that Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  apply here.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial difficulties in 1993, standing alone, might not be of much security significance. She fell behind on her bills due to the unforeseen 
circumstance of an injury and resulting unemployment. She then took action to address her debts through federal bankruptcy protection intended for just such a 
circumstance. However, over the ensuing 11 years, she has continued to experience unpaid bills, collection actions and a voluntary repossession of a mobile 
home. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As for the mobile home repossession, my assumption there is still a debt owing is based on experience in other cases where a car is returned and resold or a 
home mortgage is foreclosed on and the house sold at auction. The car dealer or mortgage finance company generally tries to cover its lost business through 
resale and expects any difference between the original sale value and the resale price to be satisfied by the original buyer / mortgagee. However, without more 
information about what happened in this instance, it may still be that the repossession and any resale ended her obligation and Applicant owes nothing. 
Nonetheless, the fact Applicant fell behind on her mortgage payments in the first place is further indication of her inability to fulfill her financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, some of her bills were discussed with her in 1999 by a DSS agent. At that time, Applicant stated her intention to pay her debts, and she appeared to 
have the cash flow each month with which to do so. But she has not paid or otherwise attempted to resolve any of the debts listed in the SOR. Between 1999 
and 2002 her financial situation worsened as reflected in her net monthly cash flow, which dwindled from about $400 to less than $100. Neither of her financial 
statements showed she has paid any of the debts listed in the SOR and she has offered no information about how or if she will resolve her financial obligations 
from now on. In light of the foregoing, there is no basis for application of any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. I conclude this guideline against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="02-27764.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> of the 
adverse information about Applicant's financial history raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the 
requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, 
which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are as follows:</SPAN></P>
