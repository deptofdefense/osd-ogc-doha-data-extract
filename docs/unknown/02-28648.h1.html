<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent accounts that have been placed for collection.  While her financial statement indicates she has the financial ability to pay

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not find that 
it is clearly in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In a sworn written statement, dated December 17, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and elected to have her case decided on the written record in 
lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a  file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was 
received by Applicant on April 5, 2004.  Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation 
by May 5, 2004. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit anything further in her own behalf.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was previously assigned to another 
administrative judge on November 10, 2004, but was reassigned to me on February 1, 2005, due to caseload considerations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted 10 of 17 factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F, and denied the two allegations regarding Guideline 
E, as stated in the SOR. These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a single, 37-year-old project leader employed by a defense contractor.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR, paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.q., details 11 debts 
placed for collection, one judgment on a debt with four wage garnishments, a deficiency for an automobile repossession, and three bad debts written off but not 
paid.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant admits SOR subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.i.,1.k., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., and 1.r., and denies the rest.  She claims her financial problems 
started during 1996-97, when she stopped receiving child support for her only child.  She borrowed from small loan companies to get through these times, but  
Applicant soon found herself mired in unmanageable debt of approximately $11,285.00.  In May 2002, she secured a higher paying job which provided her in 
excess of $500 per month after all expenses were paid.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Though her income increased, she made no effort to reduce her indebtedness<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, and  in fact, she incurred 
more obligations that were written off as bad debt.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims the debts listed in 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g., have been paid but provided no corroborating documentation.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She claims she was unaware of debts 1.j. 
and 1.l., but both accounts are listed on her credit report, which was available to her.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, in response to SF-86, question 34, "<EM>In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished for any reason?</EM>",  Applicant failed to 
list three garnishments.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She denied knowledge but admitted her employer had documentation of that information,<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> which was available to her.  In answering 
question 38, <EM>"In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debts</EM>?",  and question 39, "<EM>Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on 
any debts</EM>?", Applicant failed to list 14 past due accounts.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant claims she did not know she was supposed to provide all the information required to 
answer the questions completely.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The questions are uneqivocal in calling for "any" past due debts.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The past due accounts were listed on the credit report.  
She made no effort to take remedial measures to correct her omissions, and in two interviews with DSS agents never acknowledged her omissions on SF86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case.  Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive: 
nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, 
and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of 
rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under guideline F (financial considerations), Directive,&para; E2.A6.1.1.1. <EM>An  individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds; </EM>and Guideline E (personal conduct), Directive,&para; E2.A5.1.1.1. <EM>Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The government bears an initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>prima facie </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-28648.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>
