</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 17 May 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of criminal conduct and personal conduct.<A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 27 June 2005 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the 
case to me 12 December 2005, and I heard it 21 February 2006. DOHA received the transcript 1 March 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of paragraph 1 of the SOR. I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He denied intending to falsify his criminal record 
(SOR, paragraph 2).  He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 35-year-old logistics manager employed by a defense contractor since January 2003. He previously had a clearance between 1988 
and 2002 while he was in the military.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in March 2003,  he deliberately concealed his criminal conduct between August 1992 and January 1999 by 
answering "no" to questions 24 (drug/alcohol offenses, ever), 25 (military offenses, last seven years), and 26 (other offenses, last seven years). In fact, he had 
been arrested and charged with public intoxication, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct in August 1992 ($750 fine), received non-judicial punishment (NJP) 
in January 1999 for assault ($353 forfeiture, 14-days restriction and extra duty), and been arrested and charged with assault in July 1996 ($100 fine).  In 
addition, in November 1995, he was arrested and charged with 2<SUP>nd</SUP> degree forgery and fined $500.<A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In October 2003, Applicant was interviewed by the Defense 
Security Service (DSS) and provided a sworn statement (G.E. 3) describing his financial difficulties. He failed to disclose any of the arrests listed above. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At 
hearing, he stated he did not think any of the arrests would show up on his record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provides varying explanations for his criminal conduct. Regarding his November 1995 forgery arrest,<A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> his answer states that he was just the driver 
for his cousin, suggesting that he was never in the store. Yet he was fined $500 for this offense. At hearing, he stated that he could not remember if he put any 
items in the shopping cart of electronics equipment his cousin tried to buy with a forged check, suggesting that he was in the store with his cousin. In any event, 
Applicant knew that the check his cousin intended to use to pay for the equipment was for a checking account that did not belong to his cousin (Tr. 41). 
Applicant characterized his July 1996 arrest for assault as one of a continuing string of brawls he used to have with his younger brother because Applicant felt 
the need to discipline him for what Applicant perceived as disrespect to their mother (Tr. 43). Similarly, he describes his January 1999 NJP for assault as the 
result of a bar fight he got into with a female friend, who he claims instigated the altercation (Tr. 45).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima 
facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a 
security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J and E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately concealed his 
criminal conduct from the government.<A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> He has given varied and conflicting explanations for his conduct, but has acknowledged that he did not think his 
arrests would show up on his record. I conclude he intended to conceal this information from the government. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This conduct violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.<A HREF="03-25310.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The 
underlying criminal conduct also bespeaks poor judgment and untrustworthiness as well as a willingness to take matters into his own hands in inappropriate 
ways. Ordinarily, the comparatively minor nature of the misconduct, as well as the passage of time since the last incident, might serve to mitigate the conduct. 
However, I conclude that the conduct has not been mitigated. Although Applicant claims that he is a new person, there is little evidence to support that claim. 
Further, his various, sometimes inconsistent, explanations reveal a common thread of failure to accept full responsibility for his conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to disclose his arrests demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant 
and material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse 
information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent 
security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the 
compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve 
Guideline J and E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
