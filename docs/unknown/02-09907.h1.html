<P>Applicant and her husband are naturalized U.S. citizens with family members who are residents and citizens of the People's Republic of China.  Applicant was 
unable to demonstrate that these foreign contacts <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">did not place her in a position of vulnerability to be influenced by coercive or noncoercive means</SPAN> such that she 
would be forced to choose between loyalty to her family and loyalty to the U.S.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  In accordance with the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-09907.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-09907.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 6 January 2003 detailing why a clearance was not granted and 
recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the SOR, DOHA 
alleged Applicant failed to meet the foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B) personnel security guidelines of the Directive. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 20 February 2003.  The case was originally assigned to Administrative Judge Elizabeth Matchinski on 13 May 2003, 
but was reassigned to me on that date due to a change in the location of the hearing.  On 26 June 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of four exhibits.  Applicant testified on her own 
behalf, called two witnesses, and submitted 12 exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 7 July 2003.<A HREF="02-09907.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old artificial intelligence engineer.  Tr. 70-71, 106.  She was born and raised in the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Applicant's 
grandfather was a prosperous farmer and her grandmother was a famous doctor.  Their property was confiscated when the Communists took over China in 
1949.  Tr. 60.  In 1957, the year Applicant was born, the PRC government invited non-communist parties to make suggestions for improving the government.  
Applicant's parents, who were teachers, recommended leaders be selected by the people and teachers' salaries be based on merit.  As a result, their salaries were 
substantially reduced and they were sent to a labor camp for over a year.  Applicant, who was less than one-year old, was cared for by a nanny and her eldest 
sister.  Tr. 59.  Applicant is emotionally close to her eldest sister who washed, dressed, and cared for her while their parents were at the labor camp.  Tr. 98.  </P> 
 
<P>The "Cultural Revolution" of the late 1960s and early 1970s deeply affected Applicant's family.  Applicant's education was interrupted during the cultural 
revolution because the PRC government forced her parents to move to the countryside.  Tr. 55.  None of her brothers or sisters were able to attend college 
because the family was in disfavor with the government.  Tr.  62.  In 1977, the educational system was restored and, after being coached by her parents and 
siblings, Applicant passed the national exam and was admitted to a university.  Tr. 56.  After graduation, Applicant earned a graduate degree in English for 
scientific purposes.  She then taught English at the university until she immigrated to the U.S.  Tr. 57.</P> 
 
<P>In March 1986, Applicant departed China for the U.S. where her husband was doing graduate work.  By the end of that year, Applicant was enrolled in graduate 
classes.  Tr. 64-65.  In 1989, Applicant and her husband organized a protest of Chinese students at the PRC Consulate in Washington, D.C., to protest the 
military assault on the pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.  As a result of those demonstrations, President Bush allowed 
Chinese students studying in the U.S. to stay.  Tr. 65.  Applicant received her green card in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.  Tr. 64-65.  Her PRC 
passport expired on 31 December 1999 and was returned to the PRC Consulate on 14 February 2003.  Tr. 86; Ex. D.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father is dead, but her mother and siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant speaks with her mother and eldest sister by phone a 
couple times a year.  Tr. 91-100.  Applicant's husband was born in the PRC and is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Tr. 77.  His parents and siblings are citizens and 
residents of the PRC.  Tr. 102.  His parents were members of the Communist Party.  Tr. 113.  Shortly after the couple adopted their daughter, Applicant's 
parents-in-law visited the couple for six months.  Tr. 94. </P> 
 
<P>In 2001, Applicant and her husband traveled to the PRC to adopt their daughter.  Tr. 87.  They own a house in the U.S., they vote, and attend town meetings.  
Applicant is well-respected by her colleagues and supervisors.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR &para; 1.a., DOHA alleged under Guideline C that the People's Republic of China (PRC) still considers Applicant a citizen because she was born in the 
PRC and the country provided her a master's degree.  Individuals who act in ways that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S. may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government did not establish facts by substantial evidence to demonstrate Applicant has a preference for the PRC, or any other country, over the U.S.  
Contrary to the allegation in the SOR, the PRC does not still consider Applicant a citizen of that country.  Article 9 of the Nationality Law of the PRC provides 
that "[a]ny Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will 
shall automatically lose Chinese nationality."  Ex. A.  Applicant did receive undergraduate and graduate degrees from state educational institutions in the PRC.  
However, under the circumstances, there is no evidence to suggest that has resulted in a preference for the PRC.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline B that the PRC still considers her husband a citizen despite his naturalization as a U.S. citizen (SOR &para; 2.a.), she 
maintains regular contact with her mother (SOR &para; 2.b.) her brothers and sisters (SOR &para; 2.c.), her mother and father-in-law (SOR &para; 2.d.), and her brother and 
sisters-in-law (SOR &para;2e) who are citizens and residents of the PRC.  A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family and other persons to 
whom she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  Such contacts have the potential to make 
an individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish by substantial evidence that the PRC considers Applicant's husband a citizen of that country.  By PRC law, he lost his PRC 
citizenship at the time of his naturalization.  Ex. A.  Finding on &para; 2.a. is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government did establish that Applicant has immediate family members-her mother, brothers, and sisters-who are citizens and residents of the PRC.  DC 
1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Furthermore, the evidence supports a conclusion that she has close ties of obligation to her in-laws, who are residents and citizens of the PRC.  DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A determination that the immediate family members or associates are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the family member or associate and loyalty to the U.S. is a mitigating condition under Guideline B.  
C 1.  Applicant presented evidence that her immediate family members and in-laws would not do anything to harm Applicant or her husband and are not 
agents of a foreign power.  Applicant asserts her contacts with her family members and in-laws in the PRC are casual and infrequent (MC 3), she promptly 
reported all contacts with these associates to proper authorities (MC 4), and she has no overseas financial interests (MC 5).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The inquiry in a foreign influence case is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or connections are agents of a foreign power.  Rather, the 
foreign contacts or connections must also be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a <EM>position of vulnerability </EM>to be influenced by coercive or 
noncoercive means, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability.  ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 
2003).  Thus, in addition to considering the nature of Applicant's contacts with the foreign individual, we must also evaluate (1) whether the country in which 
the foreign contacts live is hostile to and has interests inimical to those of the U.S., and (2) whether the applicant would have access to information of interest 
to, and targeted for collection by, that nation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is hostile to, and has interests inimical, to those of, the U.S.  The PRC is a totalitarian state that depends on the suppression of its people.  Applicant 
admits that her grandparents, parents, and siblings were mistreated because of their economic situation or political beliefs-her grandparents had their property 
seized, her parents were sent to labor camps, and her siblings were deprived of education opportunities.  These are examples of how this suppression affected 
Applicant.  The PRC has been involved in espionage against the U.S., both military and economic.  While Applicant's contacts in the PRC are not foreign 
agents, their presence in that country, subject to the pressures of the communist regime, places Applicant in a position of vulnerability that could force her to 
choose between loyalty to the persons involved and loyalty to the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Therefore, MC 1 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts that her contacts with her family and in-laws is casual and infrequent.  MC 3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this context, "casual" means "not close or intimate; passing."  
<EM>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</EM> 299 (3d ed. 1992).  "Infrequent" means "not occurring regularly; occasional or rare."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 927.  The 
closer the relationship the less contact is necessary to conclude this mitigating condition fails.  Similarly, the greater the contact the less close the relationship 
needs to be to cause the mitigating condition to fail.  Although Applicant's contact with her own family has decreased since she completed her security 
clearance application, the evidence does not establish that these contacts are casual.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[E]vidence that an applicant has contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country raises a rebuttable presumption that those contacts are not 
casual in nature."  ISCR Case No. 00-0484, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 85 at *11 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In fact, Applicant admits that she has "a sense of affection 
and fondness towards China through my family."  She has strong emotional ties to both her mother and her eldest sister, who played a large part in her 
upbringing.  Her association with her immediate family in the PRC is not casual.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also established that her husband's parents and siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is a rebuttable presumption that 
Applicant has ties of affection for, or at least obligation to, her husband's immediate family.  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. 
Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  That is because an applicant's spouse is in a position to influence the applicant.  In this case, Applicant's in-laws spent six months living in 
Applicant's home after she adopted her daughter and brought her to the U.S. from the PRC.  Although Applicant no longer has much contact with her 
husband's family, her husband does.  Applicant's association with her in-laws is not casual.  MC 3 does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the circumstances, Applicant failed to demonstrate that her foreign contacts do not place her in a position of vulnerability to coercion or 
influence.  Findings on &para;&para; 2.b., 2.c., 2.d., and 2.e. are against Applicant </SPAN></P>
