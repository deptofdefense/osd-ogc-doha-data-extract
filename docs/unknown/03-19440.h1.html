<P>Applicant is a systems engineer for a defense contractor.  He was convicted in 1983 for distribution of illegal drug to an undercover police officer, and 
sentenced to five years incarceration suspended for five years while Applicant was on probation.  In September 1986, he was arrested for possession of a 
controlled substance, and his probation was revoked.  He was incarcerated for 22 months in a state prison.  The provision of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 apply.  Clearance 
is denied.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 13, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 16, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 19, 2004, admitting the two allegations under Guideline J.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on September 22, 2004.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on 
October 11, 2004, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  His 
response was due November 10, 2004.  Applicant has not provided a response to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on August 24, 2005.  The processing 
of this case was delayed by the December 14, 2004 moratorium on cases affected by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The moratorium was lifted on August 3, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old and a systems administrator for a defense contractor.  He has a certificate from a technical school, and has never been married.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant admits he was arrested for and convicted of possession of marijuana and a controlled substance, distribution of the marijuana and the controlled 
substance, and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine to an undercover police officer in July 1983.  He was sentenced to incarceration for five 
years.  His sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation for five years.  Applicant admits he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in 
September 1986.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  His probation was revoked and he served his original sentence to a prison term from November 10, 1987, until released on parole on July 12, 
1989.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In addition to the above two criminal activities, Applicant admitted to other criminal acts not listed in the SOR.  In December 1979, Applicant was arrested for 
possession of controlled substance.  Applicant was sentenced to times served and one year probation.  In June 1982, Applicant was arrested for possession of a 
controlled substance.  These charges were dropped.  In February 1984, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery but the charges were not prosecuted.  
Applicant admits to using illegal drugs from 1979 to 1989.  He has been drug free since 1989.  While serving probation in the early 1980s, Applicant was 
enrolled in a residential drug treatment program.  He completed the program as well as a work release program.  Applicant admits to using drugs even after 
completion of the drug abuse program.  Applicant admits using drugs until 1988/1989, when he realized he needed to stop using drugs.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  There is no 
information that he has been or is presently enrolled in any drug treatment programs or drug abuse assistance program.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant 
meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</P> 
<P>The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the 
person.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct: A security concern exists because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability 
and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P>Additionally, 10 United States Code &sect; 986, prohibits the Department of Defense from granting or renewing a security clearance to any employee of a DoD 
contractor who has been convicted of a crime in any court of the United States, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was 
incarcerated for more than one year. The statute also provides that, in meritorious cases, the Secretary of Defense or his designee may authorize a waiver of the 
prohibition.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J.  Applicant's arrest and conviction for possession and distribution of illegal drugs, and his violation 
of parole brings the matter under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegation or admission of criminal activity. . . </EM>), and E2.A10.1.2.2 
(<EM>a single serious crime. . . </EM>).  Applicant's admission to the arrest and conviction for possession and distribution of drugs, his admission to violating parole, and 
his imprisonment for over one year establishes the government's case.  The government bolstered its case by presenting the court documents listing the arrest, 
conviction, and sentence, the probation report on parole violation, and the criminal information sheet on his sentence served in prison.  The above disqualifying 
conditions have been established.</P> 
<P>The Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions relevant to Applicant's case are E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>), E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>the criminal 
behavior was an isolated incident</EM>), and E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).  Applicant's last criminal activity was in 1989, over 
16 years ago, so the criminal behavior is not recent.  While committing criminal acts,  Applicant's crimes were not isolated.  Applicant admitted more criminal 
acts then listed in the SOR.  I have not considered these additional criminal acts as Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline J, but I have considered them in 
regard to application of the Mitigating Conditions.  From 1979 to 1987, Applicant engaged in a variety of criminal acts mostly triggered by the use, possession, 
and distribution of illegal drugs.  It has been 16 years since Applicant has completed his prison sentence, and there is no evidence of any further criminal 
activity.  Applicant completed a drug treatment program but continued to use drugs thereafter.  However, he has not engaged in any criminal acts since his 
release from prison in 1989.  I conclude Applicant's statement to security agents that he has not used drugs or engaged in criminal acts since 1989 is credible.  I 
conclude Applicant has established that he has mitigated the security concerns for his criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>Even though I concluded Applicant mitigated the security concerns, the mitigation is not sufficient to grant Applicant a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, a federal 
statute was enacted that prohibited the Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance for any applicant who was convicted of an 
offense in a United States court, and sentenced to more than one year in jail.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"In a meritorious case," the Secretary of Defense could authorize an exception to 
the prohibition. The Secretary was not authorized to delegate that authority.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  In June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing guidance for 
processing cases under the statute.  In response, the Director, DOHA, directed that, in cases in which the decision to deny or revoke a security clearance is based 
solely on 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge "shall include without explanation" a statement recommending or not recommending further consideration 
of the case for a waiver of the prohibition.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As amended in 2004, the prohibition on granting security clearances to applicants who have been convicted in U.S. courts was limited to those who are 
sentenced to more than one year in jail and were incarcerated as a result of that conviction for at least one year.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  The waiver provision was also amended. It 
now provides that an exception to the prohibition on granting a clearance may be authorized "[i]n a meritorious case, . . . if there are mitigating factors.  Any 
such waiver may be authorized only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance 
issued by the President."<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  No such executive order or other guidance has been issued by, or under the authority of, the President.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the Director's direction in DOHA Operating Instruction 64 that the administrative judge make a recommendation whether the statute's 
prohibitions should be waived, the Appeal Board has concluded that, under the 2004 amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge has </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">no authority to make a waiver recommendation.  According to [the amendments], any waiver decision 'may be authorized only in accordance with standards 
and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance issued by the President.'  Without such standards and procedures, 
the Judge had no legal authority to make any recommendation, favorable or unfavorable, concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I disagree with the Appeal Board's conclusion.  The Appeal Board conflated making a recommendation to waive with making a decision to waive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
amendment limits the authority to grant a waiver, not to recommend whether a waiver should or should not be granted.  Nevertheless, I am not at liberty to 
disregard the Appeal Board's decision even though I disagree with it.<A HREF="03-19440.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  However, to avoid the possibility of a remand if guidance is later issued by or under the 
authority of the President, I believe it is appropriate to note what my recommendation would have been had I the authority to make one.  Recognizing my 
recommendation is not binding on the waiver authority, I recommended further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
