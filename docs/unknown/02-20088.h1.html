<P>After Applicant was laid off from his job, he was unable to pay his bills while he was searching for other employment.  He consulted a debt consolidator, but

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 20 June 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-20088.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 11 July 2003 and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel 
submitted the Government's written case on 23 December 2003.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he 
was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM 
on 22 January 2004 and responded on 16 February 2004.  The case was assigned to me on 28 April 2004.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a 57-year-old applications developer for a defense contractor.  Item 4 at 1, 2.  He is married and has two adult children.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 3, 4.  He served in 
the U.S. Navy from 1965 until 1974.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.  He was previously investigated for a security clearance in 1966 and 1977 and on both occasions was granted a 
secret clearance.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 8.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was laid off from his position as a senior engineer in 1996.  He was unemployed for one year and then became a consultant.  He took a position with 
a defense contractor in May 2000.  During his unemployment and while working as a consultant, Applicant was unable to pay his bills.  He spent his severance 
package, his savings, and his 401K savings to try to stay current.  He was unable to keep up and turned to a credit counseling service to help him consolidate 
and pay his bills.  His consulting business did not bring in sufficient funds to maintain payments to the credit counseling service.  He became delinquent on his 
property taxes, but paid them off when he sold his house in 1999.  Item 6.  After Applicant found full-time employment in 2000, he has been able to stay current 
on his bills.  But he was unable to make satisfactory progress in paying off the past delinquencies.  He filed for bankruptcy protection and, on 3 February 2003, 
his delinquent debts were discharged.  Item 3 at 3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had numerous delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.l.) totaling over $80,000,  and his monthly expenses exceeded his monthly 
income so that he was unable to pay on his delinquent debts (&para; 1.m.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts 
to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the SOR allegations.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and was unable to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  But the conditions resulting in his delinquent debts were largely 
beyond his control.  MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  He was laid off from his employment and struggled to re-establish himself.  He attempted debt consolidation, but was 
forced to abandon the idea because his consulting business did not bring in sufficient funds to make the required monthly payments.  Finally, he was forced to 
file bankruptcy.  His debts have been resolved by the bankruptcy discharge.  MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  Although the bankruptcy is little more than a year old, it appears 
Applicant is living within his means and has been making payments on his current debts.  There is no evidence he had any delinquent debts before he was laid 
off.  After considering all of the evidence in this case, I find for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
