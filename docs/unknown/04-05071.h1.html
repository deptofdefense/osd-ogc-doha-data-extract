<P>Applicant was convicted of alcohol-related driving offenses in 1991 and 1998. He has mitigated the security concern that existed in this case. Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant submitted answers to the SOR that were received by DOHA on May 19, 2005, 
and June 13, 2005, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 22, 2005, and reassigned to me on March 15, 2006, due to regional rotations.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> A notice of 
hearing was issued on May 30, 2006, scheduling the hearing for June 14, 2006. The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted 11 
documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11. GE 1-6 and GE 8-10 were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant's 
objection to GE 7 was overruled and it was admitted into the record. Applicant's objection to GE 11 was sustained. Applicant testified and submitted two 
documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on 
June 22, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 55-year-old man who, with the exception of several months in late 1997, has been employed as a carpenter by defense contractors since October 
1996. He completed apprentice carpenter training in about 1980 and has worked as a journeyman carpenter since. He has been married since December 1976, 
and has an adult stepson and an adult daughter. He has lived in the same home since June 1993 that he purchased without a mortgage. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a high school graduate. He was drafted into the U. S. Army when he was 19 years old, and served a combat tour in Viet Nam as an infantryman 
where he earned a Bronze Star, an Army Commendation Medal, an Air Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. He received one nonjudicial punishment 
for missing a formation while in the service. He attained the rank of corporal (paygrade E-4), and was awarded an honorable discharge.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) in 1971. He testified at the hearing in this case he had not consumed any alcohol 
before being arrested on that occasion. Considering his appearance, demeanor, manner of testifying, and the subject matter of his testimony, that testimony is 
credible. On the advice of his attorney, he pled guilty to reckless driving and was fined.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with DUI in August 1991 after he attended a work-related party and admittedly consumed too much alcohol. He pled nolo contendere to 
the DUI charge and was convicted. He was sentenced to six months probation, ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling $455.50, and ordered to enroll in 
alcohol education and victim awareness programs. He was also ordered to serve 120 days in jail with the entire jail sentence being suspended.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was again charged with DUI in October 1997 after consuming beer with a friend. He pled nolo contendere and was convicted of this charge in 
September 1998. Applicant was sentenced to 12 months probation, ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling $806.00, and was directed to perform 30 hours 
community service (converted to an additional $300.00 fine). He was also required to enroll in alcohol education and victim awareness programs. Applicant 
successfully completed all conditions of his probationary sentence and received an early termination of probation after only six months.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attended an alcohol treatment program at a family counseling center for approximately two weeks as a result of his 1998 DUI conviction. While the 
SOR alleges he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent at that time, the record does not contain any evidence to support that allegation. Applicant stated in his 
response to the SOR that he was unaware of any such diagnosis having been made. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was again charged with DUI in July 28, 2000. He denies he was intoxicated at the time of this arrest. Applicant pled not guilty to the charge and was 
tried by a jury. The jury heard the testimony of the arresting officer, viewed a videotape made of Applicant at the time of the arrest and during the 
administration of a field sobriety test, and was able to hear a tape recording of portions of the conversation Applicant had with the arresting officer. The jury 
found Applicant not guilty after approximately 15 minutes of deliberation. The only other material evidence of record concerning this incident, the arresting 
officer's police report, does not provide sufficient evidence to disagree with the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">AE 1 and AE 2 establish that in addition to the July 28, 2000 DUI charge, Applicant was also mistakenly charged at the same time under an arrest warrant that 
had been issued for an individual with a similar name. The reason provided by the sheriff's office for mistakenly arresting Applicant on the warrant was 
because "the warrant was served by the Jail without proper verification." (AE 2)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not been arrested or charged with any offense since July 2000. The last time he was intoxicated was in approximately 1998. His consumption of 
alcohol for the past couple of years has been limited to about a single glass of wine or beer on those infrequent occasions when he goes out to dinner with his 
wife      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G 
(alcohol consumption) with its respective DC and MC is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access 
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="04-05071.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high-risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of alcohol-related driving offenses that occurred in 1991 and 1997. He received court-ordered treatment as a consequence of the 1997 
arrest. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, 
or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use </EM>applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The record fails to establish Applicant drove a vehicle while intoxicated as charged in July 2000. Further, his testimony that he was not intoxicated at that time 
is credible. His alcohol-related convictions were separated by six years and the last conviction occurred eight years ago. He credibly testified he has not been 
intoxicated since approximately 1998 and that his alcohol consumption for the past few years has been limited to those monthly or so occasions when he goes 
out to dinner with his wife. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of 
years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety </EM>apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by his alcohol consumption. He has 
overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security 
clearance. Guideline G is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
