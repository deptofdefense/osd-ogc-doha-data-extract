<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On October 15, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2006, after the hearing, Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant's 
request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in  finding that Applicant falsified his security clearance application, 
and whether Applicant's record of properly safeguarding classified materials in the past entitles him to a security clearance.  The Judge found that in 2002, 
Applicant requested separation and received an Other Than Honorable discharge from the Navy rather than undergo trial by court martial for 22 counts of 
inappropriate behavior toward women.  In 2001, Applicant violated police orders not to contact his girlfriend.  He failed to include these facts in the relevant 
sections of his security clearance application.  The Judge found that the record contains multiple, inconsistent explanations from Applicant for his failure to 
include the Navy's charges against him in his security clearance application.  The Judge had a duty to consider Applicant's explanations as part of the record as 
a whole, but he did not have to accept Applicant's explanations at face value.  The Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable.  With regard to Applicant's 
argument regarding his handling of classified information, the government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles classified information before it 
can deny or revoke access to such information.  <EM>See Adams v. Laird,</EM> 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1970).  Even in the absence of any security violation, the 
government can deny or revoke access to classified information based on the existence of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for 
mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons 
handling classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at pp. 4-5 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000).</P>
