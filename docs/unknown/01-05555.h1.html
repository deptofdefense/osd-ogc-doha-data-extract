<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant who was involved in two alcohol-related offenses (DuIs in 1997 and 1999), but has manifested no other security significant problems with alcohol 
and, accordingly, mitigates the Government's alcohol concerns, enough to justify Government's restoration of trust and reliability in his holding a security 
clearance.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 29, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on November 21, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 18, 2001, 
and was scheduled for hearing on January 23, 2002.  A hearing was convened on February 22, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four 
exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on March 15, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, Applicant objected and took exception to an evidentiary ruling permitting Department Counsel to inquire of Applicant's drinking in high school, 
which was not covered in the specific allegations in the SOR.  Government relied on the expressed central concern of the predicate of Guideline G.  Over the 
course of the past twelve years, technical pleading rules extant at DOHA have been liberalized to permit Government inquiry of facts that fall beyond the scope 
of the specific allegations, and which have not been opened by the Applicant.  Pleading evolution can be traced from the stricter inquiry practices imposed on 
Department Counsel in earlier Appeal Board cases (<EM>e.g., </EM>DISCR Case No. 87-0491 (Oct. 11, 1989); DISCR Case No. 90-1054 (July 20, 1992)) to the opening 
of permissible inquiry in a variety of contexts not specifically covered by the SOR in issue. Liberalized inquiry examples include: DISCR Case No. 89-1587 
(August 22, 1991) (where conduct is relevant to evaluating an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation and changed circumstances) and DISCR Case No. 
92-0721 (Sept. 23, 1993) (to evaluate an applicant's claims of success in rehabilitation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More recently, our Board has held in a string of cases that Department Counsel may inquire into areas of uncharged conduct to test an applicant's credibility 
(ISCR Case No. 91-0144 (Feb. 11, 2000), to explore an area generally placed in issue, such as criminal conduct (ISCR Case No. 99-0557 (July 10, 2000), and to 
pursue areas not technically covered in an SOR, where there has been fair notice of the gravamen of the Government's security concerns (ISCR Case No. 99-0554 (July 24, 2000).  Permission to explore areas generally covered by Guideline G in this case meets our Appeal Board's more recently expressed permissible 
areas of appropriate inquiry guidelines.  This does not mean that there are no limits: Certainly, any embarkation on subject matter unrelated to the Guideline in 
issue, or excessive fishing for facts to shore up an otherwise thin or uncertain case would be subject to imposed limits (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 16-17).  Fair hearing and fair 
notice rules are not mutually exclusive, but integrally intertwined: Break the second rule and the first is placed in jeopardy.  It is sufficient to say, though, that 
Department Counsel did not exceed established parameters of permissible inquiry in this case: Actual or at the very least constructive notice was afforded 
Applicant.   Applicant's objection was, accordingly, overruled and noted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 30-year old welder for his defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have been arrested for alcohol-related incidents on two occasions: He was arrested in May 1997 for DuI, to which he pled guilty and was 
fined $300.00 plus costs, had  his driver's license suspended for six months and was ordered to attend an alcohol awareness and safety course (ASAP), and he 
was arrested in January 1999 for DuI, to which he pled guilty as a first offender and was fined $250.00 plus costs and suffered the suspension of his driver's 
license for six months.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his DuI arrests and convictions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Appellant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking during his high school years.  Before his two DuI arrests and convictions in 1997 and 1999, respectively, he had no history of abusive 
drinking.  He has completed all of the court imposed conditions relative to his two DuI convictions.  The ASAP course prescribed for him by the court hearing 
his 1997 case was a three-day education program, which he satisfactorily completed the same year, with no alcohol diagnosis of any kind (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1; R.T., at 19-20). He was offered a choice to continue with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but was not urged to do so.  He chose not to.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Currently, Applicant consumes beer at home two to three times a week to relax after work, with no recollected instances of drinking to abusive levels.  His 
consumption level varies with each sitting from a six-pack to three beers: the amount he consumed at home the night before his hearing (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 25).  His 
current drinking  pattern is one he has maintained since his last DuI arrest in 1999, and to the best of his knowledge has not entailed his ever drinking to 
intoxication.  Other than his two DuI arrests, his use of alcohol has caused him no problems at home, at work, or in public.  He likes to keep busy with fishing 
and work on old cars in his spare time (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 26)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is considered reliable and trustworthy by his supervisors who are charged with administering a zero tolerance drinking policy on the work site.  
Applicant's efforts since his most recent alcohol-related incident (<EM>i.e., </EM>in 1999) are restorative and sufficient to reflect an emergent  pattern of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk 
of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1 Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1 The alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2 The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication or a recent problem.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate the facts 
proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a respected employee of his defense contractor who bears two convictions for alcohol-related incidents: one in 1997 and the other in 1999.  With 
no history of abusive drinking before his two DuI incidents, he completed his prescribed ASAP education course and cut back on his drinking (mainly beer) at 
home, two to three times a week, but never to abusive levels.  He is amply corroborated by his supervisors in his claims he never drinks at work, or in any way 
abuses alcohol around the work place, where his company maintains a zero tolerance drinking  policy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related incidents must reflect  the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely the information developed during 
his investigation.  And in making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance eligibility, major emphasis must be accorded his most recent drinking history, 
performance and supervisor endorsements. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions and improved understanding, Applicant demonstrates he has taken the necessary restorative and corrective measures to ensure he does not repeat 
the same or similar judgment lapses associated with his prior problems with alcohol abuse.  His mitigation efforts not only reflect important seasoning without 
any further incidents or problems in this covered area, but manifest impressive and sustaining positive steps to ensure he does not experience any alcohol abuse 
relapses or recurring problems with law enforcement authorities.   It is noteworthy that Applicant's  moderate drinking pattern over the past four years has not 
netted him any problems with either law enforcement authorities or his supervisors.  Applicant's efforts to remedy his cited instances of alcohol abuse provide 
sufficient demonstrative indications of sustained mitigation to overcome any residual security risks associated with his past judgment lapses.  Based on his 
demonstrated restorative efforts to date, he may take advantage of several mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for alcohol: MC 1 (no indication 
of a pattern), MC 2 (problem occurred a number of years ago) and MC 3 (positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant makes a convincing showing  he has the maturity and resource support to avert recurrent problems associated with 
alcohol abuse to warrant safe predictions he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with such conduct.  Favorable conclusions warrant with 
respect to the judgment impairment allegations covered by Guideline G.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS and CONDITIONS listed above, this 
Administrative Judge makes the following separate FORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Appellant's eligibility for a security clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
