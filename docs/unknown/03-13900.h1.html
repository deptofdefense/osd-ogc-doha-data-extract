<P>KEYWORD: Financial; Personal Conduct</P>

<P>DIGEST: Applicant, an employee of a federal contractor, had a history of unpaid debts which led to a 1992 revocation of his security clearance.  Even after his
clearance was subsequently reinstated, Applicant continued to have financial difficulties.  Notwithstanding the ability to presently maintain current expenses
with a surplus each month, Applicant testified he had no intention of paying his debts, even though he acknowledged it was irresponsible conduct.  In 2002, he

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On August 5, 2004,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts
under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) which detail reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral
to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated September 1, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was  assigned to
me on February 10, 2005.  Notice of the hearing was mailed February 28, 2005.  A hearing was conducted on April 22, 2005.  The transcript was received May
2, 2005.   </P>

<P>Applicant has admitted to all eight SOR allegations pertaining to Guideline F financial considerations (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.), and denied the two
allegations of Guideline E personal conduct  (subparagraph 2.a. and b.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and
thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant, is a married, 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He was employed as a senior communication
technician by this contractor in November 2001.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He obtained a security clearance in February 1981, which was revoked in May 1991, for financial
considerations, and reinstated in May 1995.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN>       </P>

<P>    </P>

<P>Applicant  has a history of financial problems.  He wrote two insufficient funds checks in 1986 but paid restitution.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In 1992, his home mortgage was
foreclosed which led to the prior revocation of his security clearance.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>   His clearance was reinstated in 1995.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June
2000.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Subsequent to his discharge in bankruptcy, Applicant's car was repossessed resulting in a $11,0451.00 deficiency, which has not been paid.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN>  On April

<P>In his answer he said he could pay 1.a. through 1.c. in a few months.  He testified that his and his wife's income is about $76,000.00 per year<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>, which is

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> "Since my last interview I have thought about paying these debts off, but I decided not to for several reasons.  First of all, my financial situation is too tight to
pay them off.  Also, they're simply not a priority in my life.  I realize I am responsible for them.  However, the debts have been around for a while.  I haven't
paid them, so why should I pay them now.  I acknowledge that this is irresponsible, but I'm still not going to pay them.  None of the creditors contact me
anymore.  My federal tax refund is always returned to me, and it is never applied to any of the debt.  The only problem that my bad credit history has caused me
is that I have a high interest on my car payment."<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified
information."<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in Â¶ 6.3 of the
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  An applicant
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-13900.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here
are those conditions listed under Guideline F (financial considerations) (FC), Directive,Â¶ E2.A6.1.1. <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts</EM>; and Guideline E
(personal conduct) (PC), Directive, Â¶ E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F.  Failure to pay outstanding financial obligations gives rise to Financial Considerations
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy
debts</EM>).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's own words answer the question of how to conclude the Guideline F allegations.  <EM>"Also, they're simply not a priority in my life.  I realize I am
responsible for them.  However, the debts have been around for a while.  I haven't paid them, so why should I pay them now.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">I acknowledge that this is
irresponsible, but I'm still not going to pay them.</SPAN>"  </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no applicable mitigating factors.  I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  two questions on his security clearance application, by failing to disclose that he had debts in
arrears more than 180 and 90 days respectively.  These false statements come under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC)
E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant testified that he thought the fact the debts had been charged off meant they were
no longer delinquent.  He testified that he did not ask anyone what the word "delinquent" meant when answering the questions on SF 86.  I do not find his
testimony persuasive.  With his long history of financial difficulties, it isn't plausible that Applicant didn't know what a delinquent debt is.  Additionally, these
debts had been delinquent in excess of these periods before they were written off.  No mitigating conditions are applicable.  I conclude SOR allegations 2.a. and
2.b. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
