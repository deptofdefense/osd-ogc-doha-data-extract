<P>Applicant is a 30 year-old employee of a defense contractor.  Security concerns are raised </P> 
 
<P>based on three misdemeanor convictions, five unpaid debts, and the falsification of material facts on his security clearance application.  Applicant has not 
mitigated these concerns and serious concerns remain as to his security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated February 28, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested a hearing.  This case was originally 
assigned to Administrative Judge Joseph Testan on May 6, 2003.  The case was reassigned to me on May 8, 2003 due to caseload considerations.  A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on May 27, 2003, setting the hearing for July 2, 2003.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Hearing on June 2, 2003.  
Department Counsel contacted him on Monday, June 30, 2003, to reconfirm the hearing and seek his consent to start the hearing earlier in the day.  He agreed 
to the change, but did not appear on the hearing date. On July 2, 2003, I convened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented ten exhibits which were admitted into evidence. Applicant did not appear.  Instead, 
his mother appeared and acknowledged he was aware of the scheduled hearing, but decided to go to work instead (Tr. at 8) and defaulted his hearing.  I received 
the transcript of the hearing on July 14, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1, 2, and 3.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking a security classification</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is divorced and has two children. (Exhibit 4 at 3 and 4; Answer)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has two misdemeanor arrests and convictions in 1993 for discharging a firearm and underage possession and consumption of alcohol.  He has an 
arrest and conviction in 1997 for a misdemeanor shoplifting charge. (Exhibits 1, 2 and 7; Answer)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has five unpaid debts incurred from 1997 onward, and which were unpaid in 2001. (Exhibits 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant failed to disclose on his security clearance application completed on April 7, 2000, that he had the three arrests and convictions in 1993 and 1997.  
He answered "No" to Question 26 when he should have answered "Yes" and list the three arrests and convictions. (Exhibit 4 and Answer)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(A) The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </P> 
 
<P>(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </P> 
 
<P>(1) Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;  </P> 
 
<P>(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P> 
 
<P>(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>(1) The criminal behavior was not recent.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN>(A) The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(A) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:  </P> 
 
<P>Refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a 
personal security or trustworthiness determination.  </P> 
 
<P>(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </P> 
 
<P>(2) The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  </P> 
 
<P>(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </P> 
 
<P>None</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, I can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Likewise, I have attempted to 
avoid drawing any inferences that are based on mere speculation or conjecture.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, it should be noted that because of Applicant's failure/refusal to appear at the hearing, the Department Counsel was unable to exercise her right to 
cross-examine Applicant to develop any desired additional information or clarification.  However, the state of the record is such that I have sufficient 
information upon which to base a decision, notwithstanding Applicant's absence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government proved its case.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, 
reliability and trustworthiness.  A security concern arises and may be disqualifying in this case when there are allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person is formally charged, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1, or a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses occurs, 
which is DC 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Mitigating Conditions (MC) that  apply are MC 1 ( incident was not recent) and MC 3 (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation).  The arrests were 10 
and six years ago.  There are no repeated offenses on record.  Applicant is employed now and was married.  The offenses occurred when Applicant was 20 and 
26, not a teenager.  He should have known better.  But he has stayed out of trouble since then with the help of his mother and his sister.  Therefore, I find for 
Applicant on Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering Guideline F (Financial Considerations), I find DC 1 and DC 3 apply.  These debts are small, but they show a pattern of over-expenditures from a 
lack of responsibility about money.  MC 4 and MC 6 apply here.  While Applicant has not received formal counseling on his debts, his statements are that his 
sister and mother have helped him prepare a budget and plan the repayment of his debts.  His statement of October 30, 2001, was that he was going to pay off 
all his debts which were not included in his 1999 bankruptcy.  By not appearing at the scheduled hearing, I do not know if he paid off these debts.  However, 
Exhibits 9 and 10 show Applicant's financial problems continue, and subparagraph 2.e. loan appears to be unpaid as of May 5, 2003.  Therefore,  I find against 
Applicant on Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, I conclude the Government proved its case as it sets forth in subparagraph 3.a. that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his 
police arrest record on the personnel security questionnaire submitted in .  Under Guideline E conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicated that the person may not properly safeguard 
classified information.  A security concern may exist when an applicant deliberately omits, conceal, or falsifies relevant and material facts from her personnel 
security questionnaire or deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection a 
personnel security determination.  I find DC 2 applies to this issue.  I do not find any MC which  applies here.  Consequently, I find against Applicant on 
Guideline E.</SPAN></P>
