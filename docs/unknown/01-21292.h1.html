<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Applicant's admitted use of marijuana during the time he held a security clearance accompanied by his avowed intention to abstain from further marijuana use 
if it is necessary to retain a clearance, is identical to his vow made five years earlier. Despite that vow, he resumed such use. In light of his continuing substance

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">On August 22, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearing Appeals (DOHA),pursuant to Executive Order 10865, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry </EM>as</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> 
</SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">In a sworn written statement dated September l6, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR requesting an administrative determination of the case in lieu of a 
hearing. A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was submitted to the Applicant by Department Counsel on October l0, 2002 providing the Government's case and 
Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in response to the FORM. Applicant did not submit any additional information  in 
response. The undersigned was assigned to the matter on December 20, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Applicant has admitted some of the factual allegations as to drug abuse under Guideline H (Subparagraph l.a.) and personal conduct under Guideline E 
(Subparagraph 2.a.) These admissions are incorporated as a finding of fact. He denied the allegations in Subparagraph l.b. and failed to respond to 
Subparagraph l.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Applicant is a forty year old employee of defense contractor who submitted a security questionnaire in October 2000 and a sworn statement to an investigator in 
ay 200l. In that statement he admitted use of marijuana over a period of eighteen years. In an earlier statement in September, l983 he also admitted 
recreational use of marijuana and stated that, if such would jeopardize his security clearance, he would not use it in the future. Apparently, he has held a 
clearance since that time. Applicant made a similar statement in the 200l statement regarding his intention for future use. He now states that he intends to 
continue infrequent use of marijuana, presumably if it does not jeopardize his clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">Based upon the two uncontested statements provided by the Applicant, I find that the Applicant used marijuana at various times from approximately l983, the 
date of the prior investigation, and May 200l, a date of use to which he admits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"> Applicant has indicated an intent to use marijuana in the future in his investigatory response subject to the qualification that he will cease use if such is 
necessary to keep a security clearance.  Applicant has admitted to use while holding a clearance in his May 200l statement.  </SPAN></P>

Guidelines H and E are controlling in the present case and l0 U.S.C. 986 is applicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt">An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of

the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;

<P>(1) Any illegal drug use.  Directive, &para; E2.A8.1.2.1.</P>

<P>Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not 
properly safeguard classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. An applicable condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying is 
Applicant's pattern of rule violations including a violation of a written or recorded agreement with the agency. Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.2.5. .</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"> In the defense industry the security of classified material is entrusted to civilian workers 
who must be counted upon to safeguard such information at all times. The Government has concerns when information indicates that a worker may be involved 
in drug use particularly while holding a security clearance. Such is an indication of poor judgment and unreliability. The Applicant has failed to offer evidence 
of mitigation in accordance with mitigation standards. His statements that he only used marijuana while on camping trips and that he would give it up if he 
couldn't keep his security clearance are conditional and are unpersuasive. The fact that he obtained a clearance before when making a similar statement does not 
persuade me today. The Applicant has failed to overcome or mitigate the evidence offered by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN>. Furthermore, while a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future is a condition that could mitigate security concerns, the Applicant has expressed 
such intent only conditionally and did not discontinue use when a similar condition was stated by him in l983. Under these circumstances, the Department of 
Defense is prohibited from granting or renewing a security clearance for a person who is an "unlawful user" of controlled substances.  10 U.S.C. &sect;986</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12pt"></SPAN>The Applicant's lengthy history and pattern of rule violations stemming from his continued use of marijuana despite such use being both illegal and against 
Defense Department policy raises grave concerns over his willingness to comply with rules and regulations and indicate a possible inability to safeguard 
classified information. There are no apparent applicable conditions under the Directive that would mitigate these security concerns.</P> 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude that the Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information. </P>

about 1977 or 1978 until 1983.  He purchased marijuana three to five times during this period.  In his 1983 statement, Applicant claimed he intended to 
continue to use marijuana socially, but would give it up if it meant he wouldn't get a clearance.  Item 7 at 2.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">On his security clearance application, dated 24 October 2000, Applicant, a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor, admitted using marijuana from 5 
August 1999 to 5 September 2000, while he had a security clearance.  Items 2 and 5.  He claims he used marijuana recreationally approximately eight times 
since 1999.  He reiterated his intent to continue to use marijuana socially, but "would consider ceasing usage of marijuana if my secret clerance is dependent on 
this."  Item 6 at 1.</P>

"United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, 
honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to

be renewed.  It appears that Applicant was granted a security clearance in the past based on a similar offer to quit using marijuana.  Nevertheless, Applicant 
continued to use marijuana after being granted a clearance that was apparently based on that offer.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has not refuted or 
mitigated the evidence against him to demonstrated that it is in the national interest to grant him a security clearance.  Furthermore, as an "illegal user" of a 
controlled substance, Applicant is barred from being granted a security clearance.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P>
