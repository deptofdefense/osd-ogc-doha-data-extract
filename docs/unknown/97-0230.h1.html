<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</U></STRONG></P>

<P>On March 24, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written
statement, dated April 17, 1997<A NAME="SOR Answer's date"></A>, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and elected to have his case determined on a written record, in
lieu of a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on June 11, 1997<A NAME="date FORM received"></A>.  The Applicant also received an opportunity then to file
objections and submit material in refut-ation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant elected not to respond to the FORM within the requisite 30 days, <EM><STRONG>i.e.</STRONG></EM>,
on or before July 11, 1997.  The record of the case, therefore, closed on July 11, 1997.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on
July 18, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following single criterion: paragraph 1, Criterion H (drug involvement).  The
Applicant has admitted the factual allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.e. through 1.k of the SOR, inclusive.  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's
admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the
following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>The Applicant is a 41-year-old ----------------------- employed by a U.S. Government contractor.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret personnel security
clearance granted over 13 years ago by his present employer.</P>

<P>The Applicant has suffered from chronic kidney stones<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> for over twenty years.  Due to the frequency and severity of the kidney stones, he was in excruciating
pain for long periods of time.  On occasion the pain persisted for 4-6 weeks.  He has passed the stones numerous times without any medical procedures.  The
Applicant has also had surgery to remove stones.  On four occasions they were removed by use of a cystoscope.  He had the lithotripsy procedure performed six
times and had a stent installed in his urinary tract twice.  His physicians have over the course of his affliction pre-scribed various painkillers (narcotic
analgesics) on Controlled Substances Act schedules of drugs with "a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,"<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> including Lorcet<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
(hydrocodone), Demerol<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (meperidine), and Percocet<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (oxycodone).  When in the hospital, the Applicant has been prescribed morphine intravenously for
intense pain.  He has also taken a muscle relaxant, Soma<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (carisoprodol),<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> under prescription. </P>

<P>In about 1991, the Applicant became addicted to prescription analgesics.  From October 1991 to June 1993 he had a severe bout with kidney stones and
underwent the lithotripsy procedure four times.  The Applicant began to abuse these drugs by using them more frequently than prescribed or in greater quantities
than necessary.  He became dependent upon them for day-to-day functioning.  He obtained the medications under prescriptions from several doctors and also
bought some.<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In 1995 the Applicant, realizing that he had a drug problem, referred himself to a doctor<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> and participated in an outpatient alcohol/drug treatment program in
October 1995 conducted by a licensed professional counselor.  Although the Applicant completed the program, he had another kidney stone attack within a
week and resumed abusing prescription drugs.  On May 8, 1996, while driving a com-pany vehicle under the influence of Percocet<SUP>&reg; </SUP>and weaving from lane to
lane, he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI).  He pleaded <STRONG><EM>nolo contendere</EM></STRONG> in September 1996 and was fined.  He was also suspended from his
employment for 30 days.<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  Upon his arrest the Applicant contacted the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) of his employer and continued to consult weekly
with an EAP consultant through at least January 1997.  The Applicant also went back to the doctor he saw in 1995, who suggested admission in a seven-week
inpatient drug addiction rehabilitation program.  He was admitted on June 24, 1996, and successfully completed that program in August 1996.</P>

<P>The Applicant last abused prescription analgesics on June 24, 1996.  SOR answer, April 17, 1997.  Since his discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation program
in August 1996, he has faithfully attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) several times each week--and daily
during many weeks.  His leadership in NA is inferred from the fact that he was made the secretary of his NA group.  He feels great, intends to stay away from
any type of drug use in the future, and intends to stay active in his AA/NA groups.  FORM item 7. page 2.  He has tested negative on all the random drug tests
at work.  He also is supported in his desire for a drug-free lifestyle by his parents, wife, and three children all of  whom live in his hometown.  <EM>See</EM> FORM item
4; FORM item 6, page 7.</P>

<P>The Applicant had another kidney stone attack for which he was hospitalized in November 1996.  When he was admitted on that occasion, the Applicant alerted
the hospital staff that he was (and remains) a recovering drug addict.  The doctors at the hospital carefully monitored all his medications.  FORM item 7.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluation of an individual's
security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying
Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating
Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts
of this particular case.</P>

<P>The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION H - DRUG INVOLVEMENT</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>  (a) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). </P>

<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>  (1) any drug abuse (see above definition); </P>

<P>  (3) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical pro-fessional (credentialed medical professional: licensed
physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified psychiatrist).  Current drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clear-ance,
or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will normally result in an unfavorable determination.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>  (3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P>  (4) satisfactory completion of a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional (credentialed medical professional: licensed
physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified psychiatrist).</P>

<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences
involved.</P>

<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P>

<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P>

<P>The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made
only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of
record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly
classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing
from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of the
evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum
<STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but something
less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of
refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and
further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified
information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0230.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant successfully
rebutted and overcame the Government's case with regard to Criterion H.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Applicant has a five-year history of abuse of prescription painkillers.  The Directive defines the term "drug abuse" to include the "use of a legal drug in a
manner that deviates from approved medical direction."  Page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  In addition, the Applicant experimented with marijuana, an illegal drug, over a six-month period.  This conduct falls within the scope of DC #1, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  A drug-related incident at work is also involved.  Moreover, his
relapse within a week of completing an outpatient rehabilitation program in the autumn of 1995--although due to a kidney stone attack rather than to his
addiction--raises a serious concern as to whether he had "failed to successfully complete" the program within the scope of DC #3, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>. 
There is, of course, a manifest distinction between the facts in this case and the more problematic case in which an applicant outright refuses to comply with
competent medical direction to enroll in a rehabilitation program or in which an applicant quits halfway through the program.  Nevertheless, any relapse within
the last two years before the record closes in a case requires considerable pause and ought not to be just dismissed when evaluating the current risks of relapse. 
Finally, a medical diagnosis of substance dependence by a credentialed medical professional, rather than one of substance abuse, increases those risks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Estimates of the prevalence at all economic levels of prescription drug abuse throughout our society has often been attempted in authoritative journals.  It may
be gauged by the reported numbers of patients involved in rehabilitation programs, retreats, camps, <STRONG><EM>etc.</EM></STRONG>  It suffices for present purposes to note simply that
abuse of legal drugs is widespread and just as endemic within the United States as the abuse of illegal drugs.  The easy availability of prescription painkillers
despite rigorous enforcement of Federal law and pharmaceutical regulations is, unfortunately, seen in the instant case.  <EM>See</EM> page 3 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  Here, the Applicant's
addiction appears to have led to his abuse rather than <STRONG><EM>vice versa</EM></STRONG>.  The potential for addictive side effects of narcotic analgesics is noted annually in the <EM>Physi-cians' Desk Reference</EM> and warned those who prescribed them for the Applicant.  The issue in this case is not whether the Applicant is addicted to painkillers
nor is it whether a drug addict can ever be eligible for a personnel security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The crucial issues based on the entire record in this case, rather, are whether there has been sufficient rehabilitative efforts of sufficient intensity over a sufficient
time period with sufficient support of friends, sponsors, and professional advisers to justify a prudent conclusion that the likeli-hood of prolonged relapse in the
future is minimal.  This Administrative Judge reaches that conclu-sion.  The Applicant has demonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future and has
satis-factorily completed in August 1996 a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional.  This falls within the scope of MC #3 and
C #4, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  But that is not the end of a searching inquiry into the Applicant's security clearance eligibility.  The Applicant has engaged
wholeheartedly in a continuing aftercare program and has a close support structure to deal with relapse triggers.  He has been clean for over a year.  His job is at
stake every time his takes a random drug test at work.  Yet, the fact that "tips the balance" in his favor is the mature manner in which he handled the kidney
stone attack in November 1996 in contrast to his reaction to the one he suffered in the autumn of 1995.  The Applicant needed inpatient treatment, not just
outpatient counseling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Directive requires that the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive, identified on pages 5-6 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, be considered, as appropriate, in
making this decision.  The seriousness of the Applicant's addiction, a mental health problem, is large, but he understands that and has taken appropriate steps to
deal successfully and maturely with it.  His addiction to painkillers was not caused willfully or voluntarily through immature, abusive experimentation.  He has
not abused drugs from June 24, 1996, to at least the close of the record on July 11, 1997.  There is abundant evidence of rehabilitation and a reasonable
probability that he will not relapse.  Should there be a relapse, there is a support structure available and competent to catch him.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3 of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional
procedural guidance contained in item 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</FONT></P>
