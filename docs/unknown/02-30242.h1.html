</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 19, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In response, by letter of September 13, 2004, Applicant admitted to the 12 allegations contained 
in the SOR and requested an administrative determination based on the record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on February 9, 2005, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to Applicant.  
Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant signed for a copy of the 
FORM on March 9, 2005, and, in response, timely submitted a narrative with 11 attachments in mitigation of the allegations.  I was assigned this case on May 
12, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to the 12 allegations set forth in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 26-year-old who has worked for a defense contractor since June 2002.  In 1998, at age 19, Applicant married his then 18-year-old girlfriend.  By 
2000, he was in college and his wife was with child.  A son was born that December and Applicant's wife chose to stay at home rather than work.  Applicant, 
who worked throughout college as a part-time student employee in a career-complementary position, as well as holding down anywhere from one to two 
additional part-time jobs in the food service industry,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> continued his studies and provided for his family.  In 2002, at age 23, he became a graduate of a leading 
engineering university and, several months later, he secured his present employment.  In 2003, their son faced an unanticipated medical crisis.  Months later, 
Applicant's wife left and commenced informal separation as a precursor to divorce, leaving Applicant as a single parent with custody of his son.  As of 2004, 
the couple was heading toward an uncontested divorce, with Applicant maintaining custody of their son and, pursuant to state law, paying for his wife's life, 
health, dental, and automobile insurance policies until the formal, legal separation is sanctioned.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Around the same time in 2003 that he and his wife first separated, and well in advance of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant took a hard look at his finances 
and realized they were in sad disorder.  He soon recognized that he and his wife had spent money on "unnecessary expenses such as dining out and needless 
purchases which made the other bills late."<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> With the help of financial planning software, diligent self-analysis, and a commitment to be more financially 
responsible, Applicant instituted a budget and a plan to pay back debts.  His method was to first reduce debts by using cash then on-hand, then to use excess 
funds saved under his new budget restrictions, and then to apply the proceeds from a loan drawn against </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his 401k retirement account. These funds became 
available in September 2004, shortly after the issuance of the August 19, 2004, SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At issue in the SOR are 12 debts set forth as the 12 allegations.  With the exception of Debt 1.k, each was considered by the Government to have been past due 
as of August 9, 2004.<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  They include debts amassed by both Applicant and his estranged wife, some of which are noted as having been her debts<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and, 
apparently, assumed by the Applicant.  Those bills of a medical nature are related to the balance of his baby son's medical crisis in the summer of 2003, 
consisting of anesthesiology, radiology, pathology and both in- and out patient services.<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As listed below, #1.a - #1.l mirror, <EM>in seriatim</EM>, the allegation of debt set forth in each corresponding subparagraph of the SOR.  The current status of each debt 
alleged is explained in <EM>italics</EM>; where the debt has been satisfied, reference is made to the appropriate document supporting that conclusion.  As of March 2005, 
SOR subparagraph 1.a, also referenced as debt 1.a (balance on automobile after repossession), is the sole remaining unpaid debt.  All others were paid in full 
either before the issuance of the August 19, 2004, SOR or shortly thereafter, as noted:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.a </STRONG>- Indebted to a (limited liability company) in the approximate amount of $7,141.66, the balance owed after resale of your automobile which has been 
repossessed for non-payment, in approximately April 2001. (<EM>This debt remains the sole debt yet to be satisfied.  Applicant has expressed his intent to pay this

Applicant's balance, subject to clearance of any non-certified funds and no charge backs on any credit cards, if applicable.</EM>  <EM>There is no evidence that such was

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.g </STRONG>-  Indebted to (a credit agency), in the approximate amount of $82.26, for an account placed for collection by a cable/internet/multimedia provider, in about

$82.26 for these network services.</EM>)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.h</STRONG> -  Indebted to (a collection agency), in the approximate amount of $102.08, for an account placed for collection by a telephone service provider, in about

infant son's care, date of service July 28, 2003, paid in full.)</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.k<EM> </EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>- </EM>Indebted to (a collection agency), in the approximate amount of $355.42, for an account placed for collection by the local medical facility that was not 
settled as of March 25, 2004.(<EM>Applicant's Attachment 10 demonstrates that as of February 2005, the first collection agency's successor confirmed that 
Applicant's account was settled in full.</EM>)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.l </STRONG>- Indebted to (a state electric and power company), in the approximate amount of $41.00 for an account charged off as a bad debt in about July 1999.  
(<EM>Applicant's Attachment 11 demonstrates that his check (# 166) in the amount of $41.06, dated September 9, 2004, to the local division of that company was 
posted from his account on September 21, 2004, satisfying his past bad debt.</EM>)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has neither disputed the accuracy of Applicant's supporting attachments, nor questioned their veracity in any terms.  The Applicant's 
supporting attachments are both well organized and well narrated.  Based on the discrepancies between some of the "approximate" debt amounts alleged in the 
SOR and the actual amounts spent to settle them, the SOR occasionally used inflated or unadjusted figures.  Although asserted without supporting 
documentation, Applicant extends this variance to logically imply that the balance owed after repossession and sale of his then-three year old, 1998 car, 
originally purchased for approximately $11,000, should be closer to the $5,600 he claims it to be, than to the "approximately" $7,141.66 balance alleged in the 
SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant was totally unaware of the 1999 power bill debt noted at SOR subparagraph 1.l, having thought the amount was covered by his former 
apartment deposit. This misunderstanding was compounded by the fact that he shortly thereafter moved out of that state and no bill followed him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it should be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>The concern. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG><A HREF="02-30242.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits he had a history of not being able to cover 
his debts, specifically admitting to 12 instances of accounts past due.  Such a history raises a genuine security concern with regard to Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The most significant debt, the one arising from the automobile, was triggered shortly after the birth of Applicant's son in December 2000.  The rest of the debts 
were amassed as the remainder of their marital issues and child's health problem snowballed between 2001 and mid-2003.  Therefore, this 12 incident history 
cannot be found to be mitigated under either Financial Considerations Mitigation Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he behavior is not recent</EM>)<EM>  </EM>or FC MC 
E2.A8.1.3.2 ([<EM>i</EM>]<EM>t was not an isolated incident</EM>).   Moreover, while it is highly arguable that Applicant learned more through his commendable, self-initiated 
approach to tackling his finances problems, budgeting for the future, and implementing a repayment plan, such efforts, no matter how successful, do not qualify 
as receiving financial consulting under the Directive. Therefore, FC MC E2.A6.l.3.4 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he</EM> <EM>person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The root of Applicant's financial problems began with their son's birth in December 2000 and ran through the time his wife left him in 2003.  This period 
included the loss of income from his wife's decision not to work, his need to seek new, full-time employment after college, his son's unplanned major medical 
crisis, the couple's separation, and their preparation for divorce.  Each one of these events is individually capable of resulting in financial mishap or derailing 
the most careful financial planning and of providing extenuating circumstances.  While it is true that Applicant and his wife's lifestyle set the tone for living 
paycheck-to-paycheck in the beginning, it was extenuating circumstances such as these that tossed Applicant from the realm of modest solvency into his 
financial abyss.  Therefore, I find that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, separation</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After his wife left, Applicant addressed his finances directly.  Choosing active self-initiative over fain&eacute;ant passivity, he set out to make things right.  With his 
budget in place and a plan in mind, he had already commenced paying off debts by the time the SOR was issued in August 2004.  By March 2005, every debt 
but one was paid.  Such resolve and significant headway cannot be overlooked.  Nor can his expressions of commitment to fulfill this last remaining obligation 
just as diligently and successfully as the others.  Therefore, I find that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he</EM> <EM>individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies.  The other mitigating conditions do not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the record evidence and assessed Applicant using the "whole person" concept.  Despite the disintegration of his marriage and his early 
financial difficulties, Applicant has proven himself to be ever-increasingly responsible, conscientious, and mature.  Based on his track record for addressing 
these debts, I have no reservation that he will renege on his commitment to pay his final debt last and in full.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under these circumstances, I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated or overcome the Government's 
case.  Having thus carried his burden, I find all the allegations in Applicant's favor.  For the reasons stated, I conclude that Applicant is eligible for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P>
