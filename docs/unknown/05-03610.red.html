<P>Applicant has approximately $10,544 in delinquent debt.  Although he has paid off one debt and is making payments towards two other debts, no action has been taken to resolve the majority of the 
debts. His plan to pay off each debt one at a time until the debts are resolved in 2012 is too speculative and does not take into account any unplanned financial issues. His initial steps to deal with his 
financial delinquencies occurred too late. A promise to pay in the future does not mitigate the security concern under financial considerations. I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify his security

<P>On November 21, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan, 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On September 20, 2005, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. 
The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>October 18, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on 
arch 29, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>May 17, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-5 and 
admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented one character witness, and submitted seven exhibits which were marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-G. The 
record was held open until May 31, 2006. Applicant timely submitted five exhibits that were marked as AE H-K. The exhibits were admitted without objection. </SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on May 25, 2006.</P>

<P>Prior to accepting his current position, Applicant lived with his mother in another state. They  shared living expenses. They struggled financially since his mother only made $6.16 an hour and he was 
employed in several low paying jobs between 1995 to 2003.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In 1999, Applicant got his first credit card.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  In 2000, he and his mother purchased a home for $8000 from his great-uncle's estate. The 
expenses of owning a home further complicated their financial situation. He began to rely on credit cards for living expenses.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>In October 2003, Applicant accepted a job with his current employer which was located in another state. He more than doubled his income.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> He agreed to send his mother $375 each pay period to help 
her with her living expenses. He is paid every two weeks.  He sends her approximately $750 each month via direct deposit.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In November 2003, Applicant incurred unforeseen medical expenses.  He broke a tooth and discovered he needed some extensive dental work. In January 2004, he injured his back. In March 2005, he 
was treated for allergies and it was discovered he had an irregular heart rate. As a result, he was prescribed medication.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> All of the medical bills which were not covered by insurance have been paid 
with the exception of an MRI for $415 which was turned over for collection in January 2004.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>On September 15, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Special Investigator for the Office of Personnel Management regarding his delinquent debts.  He acknowledged his debts and indicated that he 
planned to have all of his debts either paid in full or in a manageable status within six months. He denied the debt in SOR &para; 1.i indicating it should have been paid by insurance.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  In his answer to the 
SOR, he also denied SOR &para; 1.j.  The debt was a cell phone account. He claims that  this was a pre-paid service account with no contract. He is disputing both debts.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>In November 2005, Applicant started making payments towards the credit card account alleged in SOR &para; 1.b.  He pays $100 per month and hopes to pay the account off by April 2007.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  In March 
2006, he paid off the Direct TV account alleged in SOR &para; 1.l.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  In June 2006, he started payments towards the debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.f.  He intends to pay $40 per month and will increase the 
payment to $140 per month once SOR &para; 1.b is paid off.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> He intends to pay off each delinquent account in succession and hopes to have them all paid off by 2012.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> He has not contacted any of the 
creditors regarding his repayment plan.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>In November 2004, Applicant bought a used car.  It was a 2004 model that was previously owned by a rental car company.  The purchase price was $26,000. His car payment is $400 a month.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> In 
February 2005, he received a state income tax return of $711 and a federal income tax return of $2179.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  This year, he received a federal income tax return of $2000 and a state income tax return of 
$700. He used part of this year's return to pay the debt in SOR &para; 1.l for $169. He did not apply the remainder of his income tax returns towards his other delinquent accounts. He bought clothes and 
replaced the brakes on his car.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  In January 2005, he received a $500 bonus.  He did not use the money towards his delinquent debts.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On April 6, 2006, Applicant attended financial counseling.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> He does not have a formal repayment plan with his creditors. A few weeks before the hearing, he wrote up a budget.  After expenses, he has 
approximately $29 left over each month.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  His budget does not include payments to the creditors listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j and 1.k. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded at work.  His supervisor testified that he is a conscientious worker who is good with the customers.  As the resident Blackberry expert, they rely heavily upon his knowledge 
in this area.  His supervisor has no reservations recommending him for a position of trust.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the company states they will support Applicant 
in his efforts to resolve his debts.<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> His overall performance appraisal between October 2003 and October 2004 is "exceeds expectations."<A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> As a result of his excellent performance, he has received

<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC 3 E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations since 2001. Although his financial situation has improved, he is unable to 
resolve his delinquent accounts.  He has only $29 left over each month after expenses.  Based on his current budget, he is unable to satisfy his delinquent debts.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  The majority of Applicant's delinquent debt remains unresolved.  Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The 
behavior was not recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because he still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, 
divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies to some degree since Applicant encountered some unforeseen medical and dental expenses in 2003 and 2004. However, I cannot conclude that the medical and dental 
expenses were so burdensome that it prevented Applicant from paying his delinquent accounts.  He had the option to monitor his expenses and to come up with a plan to repay his creditors earlier in the 
process.  He was put on notice in September 2004 that his delinquent debts would be an issue in his trustworthiness determination when he was interviewed as part of his background investigation.  He 
did not seek financial counseling until April 2006.  When he purchased a car in 2004, he could have shopped around for a less expensive car.  He had the opportunity to pay off some of the delinquent 
debt with his 2004 and 2005 state and federal tax returns. While he paid the $169 debt (SOR &para; 1.1) with part of his tax return, he spent the remaining money received from his tax returns on other items.</P> 
 
<P>I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem  is being resolved or under control</EM>) since much 
of the debt remains unresolved.  One month prior to the hearing and seven months after the SOR was issued, Applicant attended financial counseling. The action taken towards resolving his delinquent 
accounts occurred too late.  Much of the debt remains delinquent. It is likely the balances will grow on some of the accounts due to interest and late fees.  His financial problems are not likely to be 
resolved in the near future.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) cannot be applied as well.  Although he has paid off one of the debts and is 
making payments towards SOR &para;&para; 1.b and 1.g, he has taken no steps to resolve the other accounts.  He disputes SOR &para;&para; 1.i and 1.j. However, there is no documentary evidence showing that he entered a 
formal dispute against either creditor. At the close of the record, Applicant had not contacted the majority of his delinquent creditors about resolving these debts.  Based on Applicant's past financial 
history, it is too soon to conclude that his financial situation will be resolved. He has failed to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits he did not list all of his delinquent debts on his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position Application (SF 85 P) in response to question 20. However, he 
maintains that this omission was not intentional. He misunderstood the question.  He thought the question required him to list only loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the federal government. I 
find it plausible that he could have misunderstood the question. Question 20 reads:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">20. Your Financial Record - 180 Day Delinquencies. Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal 
Government).</SPAN><A HREF="05-03610.red.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Based on my observation of Applicant's testimony at hearing and his educational background, I find that he did not intentionally falsify his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position Application (SF 85 P).  
I find for the Applicant under Guideline E.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the 
"whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
trustworthy implications. Although Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not in question, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that he failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns 
regarding Guideline F, and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
