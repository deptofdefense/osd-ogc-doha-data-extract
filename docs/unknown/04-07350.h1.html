<P>Applicant was terminated from two jobs under adverse conditions. She deliberately falsified her employment application for a defense contractor and a 
statement to a Defense Security Service agent. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised under Guidelines E and J. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-07350.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On 17 May 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="04-07350.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 June 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was 
assigned to me on 12 October 2005. On 14 November 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 28 November 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 25-year-old data analyst for a defense contractor. She is divorced and has a 21-month old child. </P> 
<P>Applicant obtained a secret clearance in August 2000 while working for a defense contractor. Her employer terminated her employment and administratively 
terminated her security clearance for accepting collect, personal long-distance telephone calls on government telephones. Ex. 4. Applicant acknowledged 
accepting collect telephone calls from her husband on Government telephone lines, but asserts she mistakenly thought he was suicidal. </P> 
<P>In January 2001, Applicant was hired as a computer/network technician for another company that was working as a subcontractor on a defense contract. As a 
result of a favorable annual performance review, Applicant received a salary increase in January 2002. In March 2002, Applicant was terminated. The letter 
issued to her does not state a reason for the termination. Ans. at 4. But Applicant admits she had been counseled by her supervisor on two previous occasions 
about being tardy to work and, that despite her salary increase, she had been warned during her performance review about unexcused absences from work. She 
admits being told the prime contractor no longer wanted her working on the contract because she had taken a two-hour lunch without authorization.<A HREF="04-07350.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant was hired by another defense contractor in June 2003 for work on a classified project, causing an investigation of her security clearance termination 
in 2002. In December 2003, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). She admitted to the agent she had been terminated 
in 2000 for misuse of a government telephone, but denied "any other terminations from any other jobs for adverse reasons." Ex. 2 at 3. She asserted she was 
terminated from her job in 2002 for reasons unknown. <EM>Id.</EM></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was terminated from her employment in December 2000 for misuse of government equipment (&para; 1.a); was terminated 
from her employment in March 2002 for poor attendance (&para; 1.b); falsified her employment application in 2003 by failing to admit she had been terminated from 
her employment in December 2000 (&para; 1.c); and falsified material facts in a signed sworn statement to a Department of Defense investigator by failing to admit 
she had been terminated from her employment (&para; 1.d). Applicant admitted the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a and 1.c. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly 
safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established each of the allegations in &para; 1<A HREF="04-07350.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline E. The terminations for cause 
are reliable, unfavorable information provided by employers. DC E2.A5.1.2.1. By lying to her employer and the DSS agent, Applicant was involved in personal 
conduct, the concealment of which increased her vulnerability to exploitation (DC E2.A5.1.2.4) and demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty (DC E2.A5.1.2.5). 
Although none of the mitigating conditions listed under the Guideline apply, I considered her age at the time of her terminations and the circumstances under 
which she wrongfully accepted the collect telephone calls. Nevertheless, I am unable to find for Applicant. She still does not accept full responsibility for her 
deliberate omissions from her statement to the DSS agent. She admits she knew she was terminated because of her attendance problems, but refuses to 
acknowledge that she deliberately concealed this information from the DSS agent.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant committed a felony by deliberately falsifying material facts in a signed, sworn statement to a Department of Defense 
investigator, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Applicant denied the allegation. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527. The reasons an applicant was terminated from previous employment is material to a determination 
of her security worthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Applicant deliberately lied in the signed, sworn statement she completed for a DSS agent for the purpose of obtaining a security clearance. Although 
the letter of termination did not specify the reason for termination, she was specifically told the catalyst for her termination was her taking an unauthorized long 
lunch. I further conclude Applicant's conduct violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may be disqualified if allegations of criminal conduct are raised against her regardless of whether the person was formally charged. DC 
E2.A10.1.2.1. In this case, the criminal offense was a serious crime-a felony punishable by confinement for five years. Although the criminal offense was an 
isolated incident (MC E2.A10.1.3.2), the evidence established Applicant also lied to her employer about the reasons for her 2000 discharge. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as the adjudicative process factors in Directive &para; 6.3, I find against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
