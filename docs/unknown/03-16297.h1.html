<P>During a two-week period in August 1991, Applicant sexually molested his eight-year-old daughter at least twice. In October 1991, he was charged with a 
felony sexual offense, but pled guilty in March 1992 to a lesser included misdemeanor sexual offense. Applicant deliberately omitted the felony charge from his 
2001 security clearance, and deliberately falsified the details of his criminal sexual conduct in a May 2003 signed, sworn statement to an agent of the Defense 
Security Service (DSS). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On November 2, 2004, DOHA issued 
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline D (sexual behavior), Guideline 
E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely responded to the SOR,<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> admitted with explanation all of the allegations, except for 
SOR 3.a.,<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2005, and I convened a hearing on August 16, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented 
two exhibits (GE 1 and GE 2), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and presented a single exhibit (AE A), consisting 
of five letters of reference, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on August 25, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 46 years old and employed as a computer systems analyst by a defense contractor on a contract with the Navy. He requires a security clearance as 
part of his job. His work performance has been outstanding since he joined his current employer in October 2000. He has received several commendations, 
formal and informal, for his work in support of a new Department of the Navy information system.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married twice. His first marriage began in May 1983, but ended in divorce in January 1991. He has three children by that marriage, 
including a daughter who is now 21 years old. Applicant met his second wife in 1992, and they were married in 1994. Both are active in their church, and they 
appear to have a close, mutually supportive relationship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant and his first wife separated before their divorce, the children stayed with their mother. Applicant was allowed periodic visitation with the 
children. During a two-week period in August 1991, when the children were staying with Applicant, he sexually molested his eight-year-old daughter. In a May 
2003 subject interview with a DSS agent, Applicant claimed all he did was touch his daughter's vagina to apply anti-itch ointment in response to the child's 
complaint of discomfort one night. He may have done this, but on at least two occasions, he also made his daughter rub his penis to masturbate him, details he 
deliberately did not disclose to the DSS agent. Applicant testified he was too embarrassed to discuss these details with the DSS agent because the agent was 
female. Applicant also characterized his conduct as innocent and isolated, and claimed he only agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge to avoid putting his 
daughter through a prosecution. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on October 7, 1991, and charged with felony sexual abuse of a minor child under 13 years of age. On March 26, 1992, pursuant to an 
apparent plea bargain, Applicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sexual battery. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail, with all but 20 days suspended, 
assessed court costs, ordered to undergo therapy for sex offenders, and ordered to have no contact with the victim unless and until his therapist approved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's children are now grown, having been raised by their mother since 1991. He has had no contact with any of them since 1991. Around 1996, 
Applicant sent his children Christmas cards, which earned him a verbal reminder from the court that he was not to contact his daughter in any way.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1984 until 1993. After his arrest, he participated in counseling through the Navy Family Advocacy 
Program. Applicant conscientiously attended twice weekly sessions until his end of active obligated service. The Navy did not allow him to re-enlist, gave him 
an honorable discharge, and assigned him an R-4 re-enlistment code, which precluded any further military service. Applicant's service in the Navy was 
otherwise characterized by solid performance and steady advancement. At the time of his discharge, he was still in paygrade E-5 (Petty Officer Second Class), 
but was pending advancement to paygrade E-6 and had been "frocked;" that is, he was authorized to wear the uniform and assume responsibilities of a Petty 
Officer First Class but was not yet getting paid for his rank.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on November 28, 2001. In response to question 21, which asked if Applicant had "ever been 
charged with or convicted of any felony offenses." Applicant answered "no." He does not contest he was aware when he completed the form that he initially 
was charged with a felony sex offense, but has claimed he either thought the scope of the question extended only seven years prior, or that he simply 
misunderstood the question. Applicant did not otherwise disclose his arrest anywhere in the SF 86.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To that end, the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline D 
(sexual behavior), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government alleged under Guideline D the Applicant was charged in October 1991 with a felony sex offense, but pled guilty five months later to a lesser 
included misdemeanor sex offense (SOR &para; 1.a), and that the conduct behind his arrest is also disqualifying under Guideline J (SOR &para; 2.a). The government 
further alleged, under Guideline E, he deliberately falsified his November 2001 SF 86 (SOR &para; 3.a), and he deliberately falsified a May 2003 sworn statement to 
DSS about the details of his conduct towards his daughter (SOR &para; 3.b). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has produced sufficient information, through Applicant's response to the SOR and his hearing testimony, to support the allegations under 
Guideline D. Under this guideline, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sexual behavior becomes a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, 
may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant sexually molested his daughter, who was 
then of tender years and completely dependent on him for care and protection. Available information also shows his conduct was criminal in nature and may 
still make Applicant vulnerable to pressure, coercion, or blackmail insofar as it still embarrasses Applicant, as discussed under Guideline E, below. Based on 
the foregoing, Guideline D disqualifying condition (DC) 1,<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 3,<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 4<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the Guideline D mitigating conditions (MC) and conclude only MC 2<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. However, for reasons discussed under Guideline E, below, I 
still question Applicant's judgment as it relates to his willingness to be candid about his conduct and accept full responsibility for his actions. I am also 
concerned Applicant's sexual misconduct may still be used to pressure or coerce Applicant to act against the national interests. Based on the totality of available 
information, I conclude Guideline D against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. A person who is willing to 
ignore the law, thereby risking criminal sanctions including fines and incarceration, may also be willing to disregard rules, regulations, and procedures intended 
to protect classified information. Available information shows Applicant engaged in serious criminal conduct when he molested his daughter. Further, although 
not alleged as a criminal matter, I am compelled to consider that, as discussed below, Applicant deliberately made false statements to a government agency 
concerning matters within its jurisdiction. This conduct is a violation of federal criminal law under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the facts presented here, Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. By contrast, a review of the listed mitigators shows none apply. Had his conduct in this case 
been limited to the 1991 arrest, it is possible MC 1<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 2<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> would apply. However, Applicant's deliberate falsifications of his SF 86 responses and his 
statement to DSS, discussed below, bring current the government's concerns about his judgment and willingness to protect the government's information. I 
conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern stated under Guideline E is that conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In response to claims he 
deliberately falsified his response to question 21 of his 2001 SF 86, Applicant has provided inconsistent responses but has failed to explain why he did not 
disclose his felony charge anywhere on the form. Available information, in the form of his response to SOR &para; 3.b and his hearing testimony, shows Applicant 
deliberately falsified his statement to DSS in May 2003 regarding details of his sexual molestation of his daughter. Applicant has since admitted the underlying 
facts, but was embarrassed about discussing the facts with a female DSS agent. His embarrassment does not excuse him from being candid and forthcoming at 
all times in responding to government inquiries in the context of his background investigation. More to the point, his reaction in the May 2003 interview 
underscores the government's concern he may be vulnerable to coercion or blackmail over his sexual misconduct. Based on the foregoing, Guideline E DC 2<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
and DC 3<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. Further, because of the effect his 1991 conduct had on his Navy career, DC 4<A HREF="03-16297.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, I conclude none of the listed mitigators under Guideline E apply. Applicant's falsifications must be considered recent as they occurred during his 
current background investigation. Applicant made no attempt to correct his November 2001 SF 86 information during the 18 months that elapsed before his 
ay 2003 DSS interview. When he finally had an opportunity to fully disclose the facts about his sexual behavior, Applicant deliberately withheld the most 
salient facts at issue in a sworn statement to DSS. He wilfully attempted to mis-characterize what happened and minimize the severity of his conduct. For these 
reasons, his falsifications cannot be considered isolated. Regarding possible duress or coercion stemming from this information, Applicant has acknowledged 
he was too embarrassed to discuss details with anyone other than his current wife, but has presented no information about any steps he may have taken to 
reduce his vulnerability in this regard. On balance, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. No single fact or adjudicative factor is dispositive of my 
decision in this case; rather, I have considered Applicant's suitability in light of the record evidence in its entirety. Reasonable doubts persist, based on 
information about Applicant's criminal sexual conduct and his lack of candor about that conduct, about his ability to protect classified information and to 
exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate 
these doubts, which Applicant has failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
