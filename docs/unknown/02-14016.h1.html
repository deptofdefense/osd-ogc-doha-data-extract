<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 69 year old senior engineer has worked for the same defense contractor for 38 years.  He has held a DoD security clearance for almost the entire period, 
with no apparent problems.  In 1975 and 1983, he had drunk driving arrests.  In his 2000 security clearance application (SCA), he answered "No" to a question 
asking about alcohol-related arrests.  In his 2002 interview with the Defense Security Service (DSS), he at first denied any alcohol-related arrests, but after 
being asked again, remembered first one and then both incidents.  He claims he had forgotten both arrests until his memory was prompted by the repeated

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 22, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The matter was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to me on June 26, 2003, because of region 
rotation.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 5, 2003, setting the hearing for August 18, 2003.  At the hearing, the Government called one witness and 
offered five exhibits, which were marked for identification and admitted as Government Exhibits (GX) 1-5.  The Applicant testified and offered one exhibit, 
which was marked and admitted as Applicant's Exhibit (AX) A.  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on September 2, 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 69-year-old senior electrical engineer for a defense contractor and has been employed by this company for 38 years.  The SOR contains two 
falsification-related allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) Criminal Conduct).  As I understand Applicant's response, he denies that he made the 
statement alleged in his October 4, 2000 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) (SOR1.a.) and in his February 8, 2000 interview with a Defense 
Security Service (DSS) (SOR 1.b.). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the contents of the FORM, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR 
allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - Applicant omitted a material fact on his October 4, 2001 SF 86 when he answered "No" to Question 24 Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses).  
Specifically, he omitted citing his alcohol-related 1975 arrest and conviction for Drunk Driving and his 1983 arrest for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  In an 
earlier SF 86, completed on September 6, 1989, Applicant did report his 1975 drunk driving arrest, but not the one that occurred in 1985.  I find that the 
omissions in the 2001 SF 86 were caused by a lapse of memory, rather then from an intent to deceive the government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. - During his February 8, 2002 interview with an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), Applicant initially omitted any mention of his alcohol-related 
1975 arrest and conviction, and his 1983 arrest for DWI.  Instead, he said "No" when asked if there was anything else he wished to report, and "Absolutely 
Not," when then asked if he had been involved in any alcohol-related offenses.  When asked a third time, he mentioned an incident in the 1980s and, thereafter 
discussed both incidents. I find that the initial omissions/denials were the result of a lapse of memory, and not the result of an intent to deceive the government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
(Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE E</STRONG> (Personal Conduct) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation could indicate 
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire. . . .  However, I find the 
omission was not deliberate.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . in connection with a personnel security 
or trustworthiness determination.  However, I find that the false or misleading information was not deliberate.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None that are established by the evidence of record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to 
the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance. In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the Directive's "whole person" concept, I am not permitted to speculate, but can only draw those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must 
make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the Government meets its initial burden of proof and establishes conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within 
specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence. As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is clear from the totality of the record that the omitted information cited in both allegations, all pertaining to Applicant's alcohol-related arrests and 
convictions, is relevant and material to a determination of Applicant's eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. Second only to direct violations of rules and 
regulation dealing with the  protection of specific classified documents, lying on a SF 86 or to a DSS agent goes most directly to the heart of the security 
clearance adjudication process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>SF 86 of October 4, 2000 </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SF 86, Applicant answered "No" to Question 24, which asks "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense that was alcohol or drug-related arrested."  He had in fact suffered such charges and convictions, so his answer was false.  His answer of: "Absolutely not" to a similar question asked by 
the DSS agent was also false.  Such false answers to relevant and material questions have a nexus, or rational connection, to an applicant's eligibility to hold a 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only real issue to be resolved is whether Applicant's explanations qualify as acceptable mitigation or extenuation.  I have carefully considered the fact that 
Applicant did report the 1973 incident on his 1989 SF 86, and his explanations for the recent omissions. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>DSS Interview of February 8, 2002 </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this interview, Applicant's explanation was that he had forgotten the 1975 and 1983 arrests when first speaking to the DSS agent in February 2002, even 
when asked if he had left anything out of his statement.  He stated that only when asked a followup question, whether he ever had any incidents involving 
alcohol, was his memory triggered and he remembered first one incident and then the other. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In his May 22, 2003 response to the SOR, Applicant stated: "The truth is that I just plain forgot about [the 1975 matter] because of the length of time that had 
elapsed since they occurred,"and that "it was simply a lapse of memory because of the length of time from which it had occurred" that caused his failure  to 
report the incidents on his SF 86.  As to the 1983 arrest, Applicant noted that he completed the SF 86 in 2000, 17 years after the fact and that, "in hindsight, I 
should have taken more time with my answer to make sure nothing had been omitted, but the truth of the mater is that I just plain forgot about them."  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On his February 8, 2002, Applicant spoke at length with the DSS agent.  In the written statement that resulted, Applicant discussed the two incidents in 
considerable detail, along with claims that he had not originally remembered the incidents until the DSS agent asked the specific alcohol-related question earlier 
the same day. (GX 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Report of Investigation (ROI) prepared to document the conversation agrees with Applicant's claims, up to a point.  As the ROI records it, once the agent 
asked the alcohol-related trigger question, Applicant responded with a "rambling story" about his having received several speeding tickets in the 1950s, before 
going into the service. (GX 2).  The agent then asked if any of these incidents were alcohol related and Applicant stated "No."  The agent then asked the 
question again, and this time, Applicant stated: "I think I do remember one incident in the 1980s," and provided some details.  When asked by the agent if there 
were any other such incidents, Applicant again stated "No," but after being specifically asked about another incident in the 1970s, Applicant  added some 
details. (GX 5). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, when asked if he remembered the 1975 and 1983 incidents, Applicant replied, "I do now," and provided considerable detail. (Tr at 26-29).  He 
explains his "No" answer to Question 24 on the SF 86 as resulting from his having answered many questions on the SF 86 that really didn't apply to him <EM>and</EM> 
having forgotten forgetting about the 1973 and 19985 arrests.  The two arrests did have "an impact" on Applicant (Tr at 47).  When asked if he had any health 
problems that affect his memory, he responded, "Age." (<EM>Id.</EM>).  He does remember filling out the 1989 SF 86 (GX 4), in which he did report the 1973 incident, 
but doesn't know why he omitted mention of the 1985 incident.  He is surprised that he did not remember and report the two incidents on his 2000 SF 86.  (GX 
1) (Tr at 48, 49).  The DSS agent's testimony about the interviews questions and answers add more detail and perspective, but does not refute Applicant's 
explanations. (57-69).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The major issue to be resolved is whether Applicant intentionally omitted relevant and material information from his SF 86 and in his initial statements to DSS.  
Applicant's state of mind </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on both occasions cannot be objectively determined, but must be discerned in the context of the overall record.  Applicant was in his mid 60s at the times in 
question.  He is now 69 and nearing retirement, but he is currently actively employed in a responsible position, and an excellent employee according to his 
supervisor.  At the same time, at the hearing, he did show some indication of forgetfulness as to other times in the past, e.g., the mixup of his Army discharge 
date as 1967, when it was actually 1957. (Tr at 44).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I note his 38 years of service to this major defense contractor and the absence of any evidence of security-related problems or any other derogatory information.  
The Director of Applicant's DoD program, who has known him for 26 years, views Applicant to be a "valued and conscientious employee, with high regard for 
matters of security.  On those programs where I have worked with [Applicant], he has always exhibited good judgment and a high degree of responsibility and 
professionalism." (AX A).  This evidence is more directly probative as to how Applicant is likely to handle classified information than that presented by the 
government in support of the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of the record, I conclude that Applicant did forget the 1975 and 1983 incidents when completing his 2000 SF 86 and during the initial part 
of his 2002 interview with DSS, until his memory was sufficiently stimulated.  The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant had any reason to lie or 
that he was lying about the 20 and 28-year-old arrests.  Overall, I conclude that the omissions cited in SOR 1. and 1.b., were the result of forgetfulness and not 
of any intent to deceive the government. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that neither Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2 (deliberate omission on SF 86) nor DC 3 (deliberate omission to DSS agent) is established by te record. </SPAN></P>
