<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old corporate real estate planner and worked for  defense contractors in the past.  Between 1999 and 2001, she was unemployed on three 
different occasions.  The longest period of unemployment lasted five months; she was not eligible for unemployment benefits because she quit her job and 
moved to a different city so she could live rent-free with relatives.  During the periods when she was unemployed, she paid for what she considered to be the 
basics (car, food, utilities, mortgage, and condo fees).  Once she paid her basic expenses, she did not have enough income left over to pay her credit card debts.  
Living with relatives, she was able to eventually pay off all of her debts.  Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns regarding Guideline F, 
financial considerations.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the Directive).  On March 31, 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision:  financial considerations under Guideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR on April 7, 2005 and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>This case was assigned to me on July 7, 2005.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on July 11, 2005.  On July 12, 2005, Applicant signed a waiver of the 15-day 
notice period.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on July 21, 2005.  The government presented five exhibits (Exs. 1-5).  Applicant 
presented two exhibits (Exs. A and B) and Applicant's testimony.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 5, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the allegations stated in &para;&para; 1.a, and 1.c through 1.f of the SOR.  She denied the factual allegations in &para; 1.b of the SOR.  Those admissions 
are incorporated herein.  After a complete and thorough review of the record evidence as a whole, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 31-year-old female who is now working in a corporate real estate office and was recently promoted to a position as a corporate real estate 
planner.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Her annual salary is about $57,000.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In February 1999, she was laid off from her job and was unemployed for about two months.  Her salary at that time was $36,000.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Initially, she was denied 
unemployment insurance.  After appealing the denial, she was awarded back pay for two months.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She was living in a condo that she owned at the time she was 
unemployed.  During her two-month period of unemployment, she fell behind in her bills and only paid the basic ones (i.e., car, food, utilities, mortgages, and 
cond fees).<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After nearly two months of unemployment, she was employed with a temporary agency; she was placed in a position in a bank, where she later was employed 
full time at a salary of $29,000.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In October 2000, she was laid off again.  This time, she was unemployed for a month.  In September 2001, she decided she 
was disappointed with her financial situation and her new job; she quit her job that paid only $24,500 and decided to move closer to relatives.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After moving, she was unemployed for five months.  She moved in with her grandparents and lived rent-free for approximately two years.  During this period, 
she became delinquent on her mortgage for the condo in another state.  However, she was able to work out a payment plan with her mortgagor to get her 
mortgage payments back on track.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">She was about to lose her car because she could not afford the car payments; however, she borrowed money from her grandparents and paid off the balance of 
the car.  She now repays her grandparents $400 per month for the car until the balance is paid off.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On July 30, 2002, Applicant signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  She worked for a federal contractor at the time she completed the SF 86. In the 
SF 86, she indicated having several outstanding debts.  On November 6, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by security investigators about her financial 
situation.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  She provided a sworn statement and a personal financial statement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Six debts were listed in the SOR as delinquent.  During the hearing, the government indicated that this case involves five delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $18,087.  The government acknowledged that allegations &para; 1.a and 1.f are the same debt.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She offered evidence at the hearing that the debt in &para; 
1.a was paid on February 16, 2005.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The allegations in &para; 1.b were denied because this was an error on her credit report; the evidence offered supports this 
contention.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the present time, the other delinquent debts listed in the SOR have been paid either in full or in settlement of the matter.  Applicant has settled other matters 
with creditors for a portion of what she owed; these debts were not part of the SOR and have all been paid off.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant is current on her other bills since 
paying off her delinquent debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Since August 1997, Applicant has owned a condo in another state that has gained equity over the years.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  In the past she received rental income on this property 
of about $650 per month.  At one point in time her mother and sister lived in the condo but because of their unstable finances, they lived rent-free for 
approximately seven months.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Currently, she is receiving rental income.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  She is hopeful that this condo will eventually become her retirement home. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, and the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.  Specifically, these are:  (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation, and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-26475.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations:  a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts.  An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable 
criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on all the evidence as a whole, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) 
and FC DC E2.A6.1.3.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to pay debts</EM>) apply in this case.  Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt due to several periods of 
unemployment, including the time when she quit her job, moved to another state, and as a result was unemployed for approximately five months.  Applicant's 
debts were mismanaged and out of control initially but with advice from her grandparents, she was able to get back on track and pay off her delinquent debts.  
Applicant settled some accounts rather than paying the balance owed.  When she did settle accounts, it was at the amount directed and negotiated by the 
creditor.  Some accounts could not be settled and she paid them in full.  The bottom line here is that Applicant successfully paid off her debts and did not run 
away from that responsibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and specifically considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in 
the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation</EM>).  I conclude that it applies in this case.  Applicant was unemployed at least three times between 1999 and 2001.  While she was unemployed, her 
debts started to accumulate and became delinquent due to her lack of funds to make payments.  To pay her expenses, she chose to move to another state to live 
with her grandparents rent-free and get on track toward financial responsibility.  I conclude also that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies in this case.  In spite of the amount of debt she incurred, over $18,000, Applicant was able 
to pay off her debts.  She actually paid some of them before she received the SOR.  Appellant was determined to get her credit back in good shape and I 
commend her for doing so.  She also is a property owner and receives rental income.  Her demeanor at the hearing indicated that she has matured since her 
financial downward spiral and that she is receiving good advice about budgeting and saving.  She has been given a new opportunity to start over again 
unburdened by financial delinquencies.  She is timely in making payments on her current bills.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered all the evidence in this case.  I also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests.  Applicant is a mature individual who once encountered financial difficulties, including the inability to timely pay her delinquent debts.  She 
encountered a few periods of unemployment, and with financial assistance from her grandparents, and a desire to get her finances under control, she was able to 
recover financially.  Her grandfather appears to be mentoring her regarding her finances.   She has a rental property from which she receives a monthly income.  
She has started to take vacations, saves money, rents her own apartment, and receives rental income from a condo she owns.  With a clean financial slate since 
her delinquent debts are paid, she currently pays her other bills on time.  I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns caused by her financial considerations.  Accordingly, Guideline F, pertaining to financial considerations, is decided for Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
