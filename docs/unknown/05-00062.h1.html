<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Between 1988 and 2004, Applicant was  arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) or Driving Under the Influence (DUI) four times and two 
other alcohol related offenses. He was also arrested in 1992 and 2004 for possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia. His assertion that he no longer drinks 
alcohol and does not use drugs is insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns regarding his alcohol consumption and drug involvement. 
Clearance is denied. <BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>On April 5, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865,Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6,Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline H (Drug 
Involvement) of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. On April 13, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy on March 20, 2006. Applicant had 30 days 
from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an additional response dated April 10, 
2006, but no additional evidence. This case was assigned to me on April 28, 2006.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except the allegation in subparagraph 1.g., which he denied.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated as 
findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old engineer for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He has worked for this contractor for sixteen years.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He held a security clearance from April 
1990 until October 1995.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He has held his current security clearance since November 1997.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He completed his security clearance application (SF 86) in

<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant began consuming alcohol at age 17.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He usually drank beer.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> His first alcohol related incident occurred in 1988, when he was arrested for 
shoplifting a pair of shoes after drinking.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He plead no contest to the charge, and was fined $75.00.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> In 1990, the police arrested him for having an open 
container of beer outside a club.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He paid a $55.00 fine.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In January 1992, the police arrested him for DWI after the breathalyzer test indicated his blood-alcohol levels were .166 and .171.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> He was found guilty of 
this charge, and sentenced to one year of probation, fined $455.50, and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service and to attend an alcohol-related 
driving safety program and a 10 week alcohol awareness class.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> He attended the court ordered alcohol programs.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Two years later, in April 1994, while working in Canada, the Canadian police arrested him and charged him with DWI.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> He pled guilty to the charge, and the 
court fined him $400.00 and suspended his driving privileges in Canada for three months.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> In 1997, in a signed statement, he opined that his alcohol 
consumption had decreased since his 1994 DWI arrest.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He stated that he continued to drink socially, but would not abuse alcohol.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On November 10, 2001, the police arrested and charged him with DWI and possession of an open container. He pled not guilty.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The court found him guilty, 
sentenced him to one day in jail and six months of probation, revoked his driver's license for six months, fined him $828.00, and ordered him to attend alcohol 
driving school.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> In late December 2001 pursuant to court order, he enrolled in an alcohol counseling program and attended two classes.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> This program 
assessed his driver risk at the lowest alcohol and drug level. He was referred him to an outpatient alcohol treatment and education program in January 2002.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> 
(25)</SUP></A>He began this program in February 2002,<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> attended 12 sessions, participated in some of the discussions, and successfully completed the program.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> His 
certified alcohol abuse counselor diagnosed alcohol abuse and noted that his prognosis was good, if Applicant stayed away from alcohol.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> In December 2002, 
he advised that during the past year, he had drank to the legal definition of intoxication 12 times, that he no longer drove a car when he consumed any alcohol, 
that he drank socially, and that he did not have an alcohol problem.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On October 14, 2004, the police arrested Applicant for his fourth driving and alcohol offense (DUI).<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> In a statement prepared a few days later, he 
acknowledged that his alcohol consumption had increased since his prior statement.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> He admitted drinking a couple of beers after work and two to five beers 
in a social setting.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> On February 3, 2005, he pled guilty to DUI, a second degree misdemeanor offense.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> The court fined him $800.00, revoked his driving 
privileges for a year, impounded his car for 30 days; placed him on one year of probation, and ordered 50 hours of community service and attendance at alcohol

<P><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>From 1978 until 1987, Applicant occasionally smoked marijuana as a high school and college student.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> He denies smoking or otherwise using marijuana since 
this time.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> When he was arrested for DWI in 1992, the police also charged him with possession of cannabis (marijuana), which was later dismissed by the 
court.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> He states that the marijuana belonged to someone in the car.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In June 1994, local police watched his house as part of a drug operation. One evening, the police observed a car leave Applicant's house.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> When a traffic 
violation occurred, the police stopped and searched the car.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> The passenger in the car admitted purchasing marijuana from an occupant at Applicant's house

drug and drug-related items, including a small bag of marijuana, marijuana seeds, and a bong.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> Applicant and his roommate were arrested.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> On July 25, 
1994, the state prosecutor notified the court that he had no intent to file formal charges or an information on Applicant.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> On August 26, 1994, the court issued 
an order cancelling all charges against Applicant.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A><BR>

<P>When Applicant was arrest for his fourth DUI, the police also charged him with possession of drug paraphernalia. The record does not reflect the disposition of 
this charge.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Although the presence or absence of a 
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be 
measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the 
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A>Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against him.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Drug Involvement - Guideline H: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's DWI or DUI arrests in 1992, 1994, 2001, and 2004 as well as his 1978 arrest for theft 
and his 1990 arrest for an open container are alcohol-related incidents away from work. Applicant drank for more than 26 years, often to excess and to 
intoxication, causing his judgment to be impaired. Although Applicant has denied a drinking problem, his DWI and DUI arrests reflect that his alcohol 
consumption has been excessive on numerous occasions. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse by his certified counselor who initially interviewed him in 2002. 
Applicant's conduct clearly falls within Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. (Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such 
as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents  related to alcohol use), AC DC E2.A7.1.2.4. (Diagnosis by a 
credential medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5. (Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment). <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions and conclude that none apply. Applicant's six alcohol-related arrests in sixteen years 
reflects a pattern of conduct which cannot be ignored. His last DUI arrest occurred less than two years ago, and is indicative of a recent problem. He has stated 
on several occasions that he reduced his alcohol consumption and would not drive when drinking, when, in fact, the opposite occurred. Thus, his recent 
statement that he no longer drinks because he is a born again Christian is entitled to little weight. Finally, his statement is insufficient proof that he has been 
rehabilitated from his long pattern of alcohol consumption. He has always denied that he has an alcohol problem, even after a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Given 
his inability to control or cease his alcohol consumption over the years, it is highly likely that he will drink in the future. Applicant has not overcome the 
government's case and mitigated the government's security concerns. Guideline G is found against Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government established its case as to allegations 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d. under Guideline H. While a high school and college student and until 1987, Applicant 
illegally used marijuana, a controlled substance. To use this drug, he had to possess it. In 1992, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, and 
in 2004 with possession of drug paraphernalia. Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (Any drug abuse...),<A HREF="05-00062.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> and DI DC 
E2.A8.1.2.2. (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution) apply.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government did not establish its case as to Allegation 2.c. The state prosecutor's decision to drop the drug charges one month after Applicant's 1994 arrest 
support his contention that he was not involved in his roommate's drug activities. The passenger in the car had identified his roommate as the person who sold 
her marijuana, not applicant. From this evidence, it can be inferred that the prosecutor believed Applicant had not been involved in his roommate's drug 
activities. Allegation 2.c. under Guideline H is found in favor of Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant's admitted use of marijuana occurred many years ago, his most recent arrest and charge for drug paraphernalia raises questions about his 
continued occasional use of this illegal substance. His denial of drug use is insufficient to overcome the government's case. He has not mitigated the 
government's concerns. Guideline H is found against him. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant a security clearance to Applicant.<BR>
