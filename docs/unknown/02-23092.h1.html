<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol-related arrests and convictions (four in all) over a 17-year period spanning 1984 and December 2001.  While he has since cut 
back significantly on his drinking, he has declined any counseling or evaluations by a credentialed substance abuse counselor, refused breath tests by 
investigating police officers at the scene in connection with two of his alcohol-related incidents, and still shows too many signs of potential denial to make the 
safe predictions he is no longer a recurrence risk.   By contrast, he successfully mitigates security concerns associated with his SF-86 omissions, domestic abuse 
arrest, and his post-military financial problems that prompted his bankruptcy in 2000 by showing these actions were either unsubstantiated or involved isolated 
financial setbacks that Applicant has been able to studiously avoid since his discharge.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 19, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 6, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 6, 2003.  Pursuant to 
notice of August 15, 2003, a hearing was scheduled for September 23, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  A hearing was convened as scheduled.  At hearing, the Government's case 
consisted of  six exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the  was received on October 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 52-year-old specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1973 to at least 
ay 2002, (b) been charged with public intoxication in June 1984 and fined $70.00, (c) been involved in three DuI incidents between January 1987 and 
December 2001 in which he was both arrested and convicted, and (d) reported to work in May 1999 smelling of alcohol on at least 4 to 5 occasions, after which 
he was confronted by his supervisor about it. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) in March 2000 by omitting his June 1984 and January 1987 
arrests.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have filed for Chapter 13 relief in October 1999, changed to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2000, in 
which his liabilities totaled $187,168.34.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  He denied his alleged arrest of December 2001 as well as his alleged reporting to 
work in May 1999 smelling of alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant retired from the Army in 1999 at the rank of master sergeant after holding a security clearance for over 24 years.  Over the course of a 17-year period 
spanning his military service and civilian career, Applicant was arrested on four separate occasions for alcohol-related incidents.  Most of these incidents 
occurred while Applicant was in the military (<EM>i.e.,  </EM>between May 1973 and July 1999).  In the first such incident, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication 
in June 1984 and fined $70.00.  Three years later (in January 1987) he was arrested for DuI and having a blood alcohol concentration of .10 per cent or more.  
He had been involved in an altercation with another person at a local nightclub.  He was arrested for DuI at the scene after he refused to submit to a 
Breathalyzer.  In court, Applicant pleaded guilty to his DuI charge and was sentenced to four days in jail, fined $700.00, ordered to make restitution to the 
victim, complete a drinking driver program II and placed on three years of probation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested for a third alcohol-related incident (a DuI offense) in October 1998 after consuming 12 beers over a 6-hour period at a local club.  On his 
way home from the </SPAN>club he stopped at a red light and fell asleep.  When the police arrived at the request of a caller, they administered a breath test to Applicant, 
which he failed.  Applicant later pleaded no contest to a DuI charge and was fined $200.00, in addition to being sentenced to five days in jail (which he served 
on weekends).  Later (in1999) he binged on alcohol for about a week after suffering a string of family losses: his mother, sister and mother-in-law passed away 
over a three-month period (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 46).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's fourth alcohol-related incident (a DuI offense) occurred in December 2001.  He had frequented a bar with his girlfriend and consumed three beers 
and a shot of tequila over a 4 to 5 hour span.  As the result of a brief ensuing argument with his girlfriend, she called the police and accused him of domestic 
abuse.  This was not the first such time she had charged Applicant with domestic abuse: She had called police with a domestic abuse charge just three months 
earlier (in September 2001).  After investigation of this earlier 2001 incident involving Applicant and his girlfriend, the police arrested both of them for 
domestic abuse (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).</P> 
 
<P>After being confronted by police in his driveway of his home on the report of his girlfriend in December 2001, Applicant was charged with DuI after refusing to 
take a breath test at the scene.  In their police report, the arresting officers described Applicant as exhibiting bloodshot eyes and unsteadiness on his feet when 
administered a field sobriety test.  In court, he pleaded guilty to the DuI charge and was fined $350.00, ordered to attend DuI school, and placed on 
unsupervised probation for six months.  </P> 
 
<P>Since his December 2001 DuI arrest, Applicant has cut back on his drinking to one to three times a week, mostly at home.  When he drinks at social gatherings, 
he designates a driver when a car is involved.  Applicant has never thought he had a drinking problem; although, he did abstain from alcohol entirely for a two-year period between 1996 and 1998 after being advised to do so by his physician for health reasons (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 46-47).  He has never been diagnosed or treated 
for alcohol problems or attended an AA meeting.  He assures no one has ever told him he has an alcohol problem, and he continues to believe that despite his 
history of alcohol-related incidents, he does not  have an alcohol problem that needs addressing. </P> 
 
<P>Until recently, Applicant consumed alcohol one to three times a month, consuming about 4 beers per occasion (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  Since 1973, Applicant has consumed 
more than 4 beers at any one sitting on no more than 12 occasions.  He assures he gave up drinking altogether two weeks before the hearing as the result of his 
finding God in his life (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 42).  He provides no corroboration for his conversion to abstinence, however, and nothing to document a positive prognosis 
free fo recurrence risks. </P> 
 
<P>When completing his March 2000 SF-86, Applicant omitted his June 1984 and January 1987 DuI arrests.  He attributed his omissions to a misunderstanding 
over the scope of question 24 (inquiring about his alcohol-related arrests).  His FSO had counseled him to limit his response to incidents within the previous 10 
years (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 26).   Applicant had listed these two arrests in a previous SF-86 (<EM>see </EM>ex. 5) and impresses to be sincere about his misundestanding.  
Considering all of the circumstances surrounding his omissions and explanations, inferences warrant that his omissions are attributable to mistake and not 
deliberate concealment.</P> 
 
<P>After retiring from the military in 1999, Applicant and his spouse encountered significant income losses: from $4,000.00 a month to around $1,800.00 a month.  
Unable to stay up with their debts, he and his spouse filed for Chapter 13 wage earner's relief in October 1999.  Later they converted their Chapter 13 petition to 
a straight Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and were discharged in bankruptcy in July 2000.  Following their separation in March 2000, Applicant and his spouse 
later finalized their divorce and have maintained separate lives. </P> 
 
<P>Since his July 2000 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant  has managed to keep his debts current and has avoided any financial problems with his creditors.  
Applicant has been able to reduce the $30,000.00 loan balance on his car purchase to about $20,000.00.  With a current monthly income of $3,600.00, he has 
about $200.00 in remainder each month.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a specialist for a defense contractor with over 20 years of holding a security clearance in the Army preceding his retirement in 1999 at the 
rank of master sergeant.   His four alcohol-related incidents over 17 years reflect alcohol abuse by Applicant and documented proof of his having a recurring 
problem with alcohol through December 2001 (when he was involved in his last-reported DuI incident).  Never diagnosed as an abusive drinker or alcohol 
dependent, Applicant, nonetheless, occasionally drank excessively while in social situations or more recently in the company of his girlfriend. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his 1998 DuI conviction, Applicant was sentenced to ten days in jail in addition to being fined and directed to surrender his driving privileges for six 
months.  Still not believing he had any kind of a drinking problem he avoided counseling or treatment.  Three years later (in December 2001) he was convicted 
of still another DuI offense, and this time was ordered to attend a DuI school and placed on six months probation.  Again, he declined to seek counseling or AA 
assistance, self-assured he didn't have an alcohol problem.  He continued to drink, albeit less frequently, up until two weeks ago when he made the decision to 
give up alcohol altogether.  He attributes his decision to embrace abstinence to finding God, however, and not to coming around to the belief he might have an 
alcohol problem.  In addressing the questions raised in this proceeding as to whether he is still at risk to recurrent abusive drinking he provides no corroboration 
or documentation of any kind from family, work colleagues, or substance abuse counselors to counter his past impressions of denial. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having continued on with his drinking following his latest two alcohol-related incidents, Applicant manifests not only denial of any potential alcohol problems 
associated with his drinking but also his unwillingness to seek the documentary support to corroborate his assurances.  On the strength of the evidence 
presented, one disqualifying condition (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away 
from work).  Allegations  of Applicant's smelling of alcohol when reporting to report on several occasions over the past three years were never substantiated 
and cannot be considered disqualifying.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related conduct must be made on the basis of a review of the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely the 
information developed with respect to his identified four alcohol-related offenses.  In making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance eligibility, major 
emphasis must be accorded his most recent drinking history, his lack of any resort to counseling or evaluation by a credentialed substance abuse counselor to 
assess any risks associated with his continued drinking, even at reduced frequency levels, and the adequacy of the time elapsed since his last DuI in the face of 
his continued drinking.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions to date, Applicant provides too little evidence of his learning from his judgment lapses associated with his alcohol-related incidents.  Applicant's 
situation is one where he might have acquired a firmer understanding of past excessive consumption of alcohol preceding his use of a motor vehicle but chose 
to rely on his own self assessments.  Whether Applicant is in denial of an alcohol problem is uncertain and cannot be accurately assessed without a professional 
evaluation.  His noted failure to submit to breath tests in two of his alcohol-related incidents (with the last preceding his December 2001 DuI arrest) are 
troubling, considering applicant's continued insistence he doesn't have an alcohol problem.  His actions reveal possible denial.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, all in all, Applicant's mitigation efforts to date reflect too much uncertainty to absolve him of risks of recurrent alcohol abuse.   His avoidance of any 
additional alcohol-related incidents over the past 22 months, while encouraging, is still not enough to facilitate safe predictive judgments about his ability to 
avert any alcohol abuse relapses or recurring problems with law enforcement authorities in the foreseeable future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's still limited efforts to remedy his judgment lapses associated with the abue of alcohol preclude him at this time from taking enough advantage of 
any of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption to mitigate security concerns associated with his prior alcohol-related incidents.  While he is to be encouraged in his recent abstinence commitments, more time is needed to mitigate current security concerns over his 
drinking.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make the convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert 
any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with 
such conduct.  Un favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.e of Guideline G.  
Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraph 1.f, which were never substantiated. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concern as well are Applicant's omissions of two of his previous DuI arrests from his March 2002 SF-86.  Applicant's explanations of 
his misreading the question, which were preceded by his listing his omitted 1984 and 1987 DuI arrests in his 1994 SF-86, are sufficient to enable Applicant to 
surmount the falsification implications of his omissions.  In a similar vein, Applicant's September 2001 arrest for domestic abuse of his girlfriend was 
subsequently dismissed and is too isolated to reflect any pattern judgment impairment and untrustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the strength of the evidence presented, Applicant may invoke MC 1 (information unsubstantiated) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct and 
carries his evidentiary burden in refuting the allegations he falsified his SF-86 by omitting his two prior alcohol-related arrests in 1984 and 1987, respectively.   
Further, his lone September 2001 domestic abuse arrest is sufficiently unproven as to his culpability and isolated to avert inferences of questionable judgment 
and untrustworthiness.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of the allegations covered by Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potential security concerns raised by Applicant's 1999 Chapter 13 petition and ensuing Chapter 7 conversion and discharge in March 2000 are neutralized by 
Applicant's demonstrated </SPAN>stabilization of his finances and avoidance of delinquencies.  Altogether, Applicant can  reasonably claim over three years of 
uninterrupted financial stability, with good prospects for maintaining healthy finances in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Based on Applicant's testimony, Applicant's covered debts are both extenuated and mitigated by circumstances and time (<EM>viz., </EM>his reduced income following his 
military retirement in 1999).  Applicant may take advantage of two mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate and mitigate his actions: 
C 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) and MC 6 (good-faith effort to repay creditors).  Favorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with 
respect to sub-paragraph 3.a  of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing  financial considerations.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
