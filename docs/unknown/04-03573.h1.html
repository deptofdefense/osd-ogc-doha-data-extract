<P>Applicant was born in the Republic of Vietnam, now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, in 1965.  He became a United States citizen in 1993.  While also born 
in the Republic of Vietnam, his wife, one of his sisters, one of his brothers, his mother-in-law, father-in-law are all United States citizens, living in the United 
States.  His United States born children reside with him.  Security concerns have been raised because Applicant's elderly mother, sister and brother are citizens 
of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and continue to reside there.  Applicant has failed to mitigate security concerns arising from possible foreign influence.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On March 18, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program  </EM><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN>Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">,</SPAN> issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR, which is essentially an administrative complaint, detailed 
reasons under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant a security clearance to the Applicant.  DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted.</P> 
<P>On April 12, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the case decided on the written record. On July 5, 2005, Department Counsel 
prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the file on July 12, 2005.  He did not submit additional information.  
This case was assigned to me on August 24, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P>

<P>Applicant's father and mother were born in the RVN.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  His father is deceased.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Applicant is one five children all of whom were born in the RVN.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  One of

tactics as is the way of life there."<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline.  In addition, each security 
clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against her.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence</STRONG>): A security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he 
or she may be bound by affection, influence or obligation <EM>are not </EM>citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in 
other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</P> 
<P>As noted by the Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v.</EM> <EM>Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), "it should be obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance"<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> and "the 
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  The decision to 
deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of the appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>An immediate family member, or 
person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in a foreign country).  </EM>An immediate family 
member includes a spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother and sister.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> Applicant has a mother, sister and brother who are citizens of SRVN and live 
there.  While the possession of family ties with a person in foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B,<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> such ties do raise a 
<EM>prima facie</EM> security concern.  This concern is sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the 
applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.<A HREF="04-03573.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>I have considered all the potentially mitigating conditions under Guideline B in this case. I specifically considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI 
C) E2.A2.A.1.3.1. <EM>(A determination that the immediate family member(s), spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, cohabitant, or 
associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States)</EM>,<EM> </EM>and conclude it does not apply in this case.  No information was provided to show whether 
Applicant's family has any ties to the government.  No information was provided  about their background, employment history, or present status, which would 
reassure this government that they are not in a position that would subject them to exploitation by their government and subsequently, compromise the 
Applicant's loyalty to the United States</P> 
<P>I have also specifically considered FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2. <EM>(Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent)</EM>, and conclude it does not 
apply.  Applicant has infrequent contact and visits with his family.  However, he occasionally sends money to them for their personal use, indicating his 
intention to be helpful and remain connected.  I find this contact to be more than casual.</P> 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept.  It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables.  Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>I have considered the evidence in this case in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interest, including his work history, 
education and citizenship of family members residing in the United States.  However, Applicant's mother, sister and brother are Vietnamese citizens.  With the 
limited information provided, the contact Applicant has with his relatives could create a position of vulnerability for him.  These facts raise doubts about 
Applicant's ability to protect classified information unfettered by concerns about family members who may be subject to the interests of a foreign government 
and thus, his suitability for access to classified information.  Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, and 
considering the whole person, I find applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that 
it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
<P>Paragraph 1 Guideline B (Foreign Influence):     AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:      Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:      Against Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for
