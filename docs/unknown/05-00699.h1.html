<P>From the mid-1980s until 2005, Applicant incurred significant debt while self employed. In 1995, the Internal Revenue Service filed a tax lien for unpaid taxes. 
With interest and penalties, this lien totals more than $26,000. In 2004, the state filed a lien for unpaid taxes in the amount of $4900. In December 2005, a 
United States Bankruptcy Court discharged all his debts, except the approximately $31,000 in tax liens, which remain unpaid. He has not made any effort to pay 
these liens nor has he developed a repayment plan. He has not mitigated or overcome the government's security concerns based on financial considerations. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 24, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On December 
14, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations, and requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>This case was assigned to me on January 3, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on January 20, 2006, and a hearing was held on February 10, 2006. Five 
government exhibits and four Applicant exhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on February 16, 
2006.</P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative</P> 
<P>guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with 
the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in 
reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against him.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-00699.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a long history of excessive debt, including a foreclosure on his house. In 1992 and 
1993, he reorganized his debt under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and then continued to pay his creditors. In 1995, the IRS filed a tax lien for unpaid taxes, and in 
2004, the state filed a tax lien for unpaid taxes. Neither tax lien has been paid. In 2005, all of his debts, except the tax liens, were discharged under Chapter 7. 
Applicant's financial problems clearly fall within the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial 
obligations</EM>) and E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>)</P> 
<P>A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways., Applicant's debt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, are not 
recent, and are not an isolated incident. Thus, he has not established a mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 
E2.A6.1.3.1. and E2.A6.1.3.2. Likewise, his continued lack of a livable income from his business because of poor management skills is not a factor beyond his 
control. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. is not a basis to mitigate in this case.</P> 
<P>He has owed federal taxes since 1995. He has not taken any steps to actually pay his back taxes. While he is not unwilling to pay his outstanding tax debt, he 
has lacked the financial resources to make any payments. By discharging his debts in bankruptcy recently, Applicant has an opportunity to start anew. He has 
not developed a plan to pay his outstanding taxes with the extra money each month, not has he sought counseling for resolving this problem, thus, he has not 
established a mitigating factor under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. and E2.A6.1.3.6. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated and overcome the government's 
security concerns under Guideline F. </P> 
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. He still owes 
significant money on back taxes. In the last four years, his employment and income have stabilized, allowing him to continue paying some of his old debt. 
Nonetheless, he filed for bankruptcy because his debt was too high to manage. He, however, has never made any arrangements to pay his overdue taxes. While 
his expressed desire to pay the debt is admirable, he has no plan to pay this debt and does not believe he has the financial resources to do so. He has not 
explained how the excess profit from the sale of his foreclosed property could have been used to pay his tax liens. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that 
it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
