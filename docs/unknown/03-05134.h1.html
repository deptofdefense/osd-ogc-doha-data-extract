<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol consumption concerns as a result of seven alcohol-related incidents in the 1980s and four alcohol-related incidents in the 
1990s.  Beginning in 1995, Applicant began tapering his drinking down until he reached total abstinence in January 2004.  Additionally, he has undergone 
positive behavior changes supportive of sobriety.  Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns as a result of past alcohol-related incidents.  
Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 15, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-05134.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 23, 2004, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me March 22, 2004.  On April 30, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government withdrew SOR &para;&para; 1.c., 1.e., 1.g., 2. and 2.a.  The government offered 11 documents, which were admitted without objection as Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11.  The Applicant offered three documents, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C.  DOHA 
received the transcript on May 11, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old unmarried man, who lives with his girlfriend, girlfriend's 14-year-old daughter, and their one-year-old son.  Applicant provides total 
support for his girlfriend's daughter and their son.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant is employed as an electrical engineering assistant for a defense contractor.  He has been with the same employer since August 1982, approximately 
23 years as a technical specialist.  He seeks to renew his security clearance as a requirement for employment.  He has held a secret security clearance since 
September 1982.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 1980, Applicant was charged with underage drinking and leaving the scene of an accident.  He paid a fine for both charges.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 22, 1981, Applicant was arrested and charged for being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The charges were amended to disorderly conduct and 
he paid a fine.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1983, Applicant was cited for disorderly conduct after he had been drinking.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 30, 1984, Applicant was cited for disorderly conduct.  Applicant advised the reporting officer that he was "drunk."  GE 11.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 14, 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged for driving under the influence.  The case was nolle processed.  GE 10.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 8, 1989, Applicant was cited for disorderly conduct and public drunkenness.  He pled guilty to both offenses and paid a fine.  GE 9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1989, Applicant was arrested for public drunkenness in lieu of driving under the influence.  He paid a fine as a result of this incident.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 30, 1991, the police responded to a domestic disturbance involving Applicant and his girlfriend.  Applicant and his girlfriend had been drinking.  
Applicant was neither arrested nor charged as a result of this incident.  GE 8, GE 2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 6, 1993, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated.  Applicant pled guilty and was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for not less 
than 48 hours nor more than 12 months to perform litter pickup, to pay costs of prosecution and a fine of $300.00, to obtain an alcohol evaluation and treatment 
if recommended, and attend safe driving school.  GE 6, GE 2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 5, 1996, Applicant was arrested for simple assault and harassment during a domestic disturbance involving his girlfriend. All of the subjects 
involved were intoxicated.  The charges were dismissed based on the victim's failure to appear.  GE 5, GE 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 16, 1999, Applicant was arrested on a military installation and charged with disorderly conduct, harassment, resisting arrest, and terroristic threats.  
On January 6, 2000, he was found guilty of resisting arrest and ordered to pay a fine and special assessment totaling $1010.00.  Applicant was intoxicated when 
arrested.  GE 4, GE 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the 1980s, Applicant drank heavily on weekends and occasionally during the week.  Alcohol was involved in all of the incidents discussed above.  From 
1995 to 2002, Applicant drank primarily on weekends, and occasionally during the week, limiting his drinking to beer or wine supplemented with occasional 
hard liquor.  From 2002 to 2004, Applicant primarily drank beer on weekends.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since January 11, 2004, Applicant has abstained from drinking completely.  He realized the adverse impact alcohol was having on his life.  This realization 
came  after a heated argument with his father.  Additionally, the responsibility of becoming a father weighed on him causing him to modify his lifestyle. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon the advice of counsel, Applicant consulted a health care professional after his October 1999 incident, discussed above.  He "went in for a couple 
sessions."  Applicant has not been diagnosed as an alcoholic or as alcohol dependent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a superb work record.  His supervisor testified, "[Applicant's] work is viewed very highly in the company.  He is ranked as one of the top two 
people in the company . . . in his particular peer group."  Tr. 22.  A former supervisor testified Applicant was "one of the best technicians" he ever worked with.  
Tr. 36.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's girlfriend testified to his good character, his being a model parent to their one-year-old son and stepdaughter, and verified he has not had a drink 
since January 2004.  She further confirmed that before he quit drinking, his drinking was moderate and limited to weekends.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted three exhibits attesting to his honesty, work ethic and overall good character.  AE A through C.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had a number of alcohol-related incidents (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.o.) to include six arrests and five incidents not resulting in an 
arrest.  Three alcohol-related SOR allegations (&para;&para; 1.c., 1.e., 1.g.) were withdrawn by the government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case in part by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted for each of the remaining allegations contained in the SOR.  
There is no doubt that Applicant's use of alcohol has caused him considerable problems in the past.  The 1980s were a particularly troublesome time for him 
with a total of seven alcohol-related incidents followed by four alcohol-related incidents in the 1990s.  Fortunately, none of the reported alcohol-related 
incidents or conduct carried over to Applicant's work place.  Applicant has held a clearance since 1982 and renewed it in 1992.  Such conduct gives rise to 
Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Condition (AC DC) &para; E2.A7.1.2.1. <EM>(Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, 
fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use);</EM>and AC DC &para; E2.A8.1.2.5.<EM> (Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the 
point of impaired judgment).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began tapering his drinking down starting in 1995 until he finally stopped drinking in January 2004.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest 
Applicant is an alcoholic or alcohol dependent.  Applicant's past problems with alcohol appear to be behind him.  Weighing heavy on his mind are his new 
responsibilities at home and the jeopardy his conduct has placed him with his employer.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has demonstrated that he has been a dedicated employee for 23 years without any security violations.  He has not had any alcohol-related incidents at 
work and is a valued and trust employee.  He is a homeowner, in a steady relationship, and a new father and stepfather.  Applicant's turnaround behavior 
triggered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) &para; E2.A7.1.3.2. <EM>(The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a 
recent problem) </EM>and AC MC &para; E2.A7.1.3.3. <EM>(Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety).  </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of the circumstances to include his documented actions coupled with his credible testimony, I find for Applicant on SOR &para; 1 and &para;&para; 1.a. 
and 1.b., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.h. through 1.o.  &para;&para; 1.c., 1.e., 1.g., 2. and 2.a. were withdraw by the government.</SPAN></P>
