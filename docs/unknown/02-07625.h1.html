<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Jordan, has failed to fulfill the requirements of the Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum) by not relinquishing his Jordanian passport to the proper 
Jordanian authorities, despite his indicated desire to return it.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> None of Applicant's immediate family members </SPAN>are in a position to be exploited in a way that 
could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN>Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 
28, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied. The SOR was based on foreign preference (Guideline C) related to his exercise of 
dual citizenship with the United States and Jordan and his retention of a  foreign passport, and on foreign influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the 
foreign residency and citizenship of close family members.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated June 5, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in 
lieu of a hearing. On September 8, 2003,  Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
had until October 16, 2003, to file a response to the FORM, and a response was received. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 27, 
2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 10). Applicant's response to the FORM has been identified and entered as 
Exhibit A.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all eight allegations, 1.a. and  1.b., and 2.a. through 2.f. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 36 year old employee of a defense contractor. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He is unmarried and has no children.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He received a bachelors degree and a masters degree in 
mechanical engineering from a United States university.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was born in the Jordan in 1967 and immigrated to the United States in 1987. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Since he came to the United States, Applicant has traveled to Jordan to visit his family in 1991, 1999, and 2001 (Exhibit 5).  He used his Jordanian passport on 
the trips in 1992 and 1999, before he became a United States citizen. W</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">hen in Jordan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, i</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">n 1999, he renewed his Jordanian passport, which </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">will expire in July, 
2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  He has not used, but has retained his Jordanian passport after he became a United States citizen.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> considers himself a dual citizen of  Jordan and the United States. While he has expressed a willingness to renounce his Jordanian citizenship and 
relinquish his passport he has taken no affirmative step to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">relinquish his Jordanian  passport to the proper Jordanian authorities</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> or to renounce his citizenship 
(Exhibits 3 and 5). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate 
family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are citizens of Jordan, and  may be subject to duress. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's mother is a citizen of Jordan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and now resides </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in the United States.  He has two sisters and one brother who are dual citizen of Jordan and United 
States and now reside in United States. He has one brother who is a citizen of Jordan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and resides </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in the United States. Finally, he has one brother who is a 
Jordanian citizen and lives in Jordan. This brother is in the process of attempting to acquire a visa so he can also move to the United States. None of these 
family members is connected with the Jordanian government. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or 
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">          </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline C  (Foreign Preference)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2.1 The exercise of dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2.2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.3.4. Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence</STRONG>)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's failure to relinquish 
his Jordanian passport to the proper Jordanian authorities, despite his stated intention to relinquish said passport, raises serious foreign preference Guideline C 
concerns. Applicant's retention of his Jordanian passport is a violation of the Money Memorandum, and therefore Applicant is absolutely barred from retaining 
a security clearance. Disqualifying Condition (DC)  E2.A3.1.2.2. applies because of Applicant's failure to return his passport to the proper authorities. 
itigating Condition  (MC) E2.A3.1.3.4. applies in this case under Guideline C because of Applicant's stated willingness to renounce his Jordanian citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an 
initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline B</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. Applicant has five immediate family members who are citizens of Jordan, and one 
who is a citizen of and resides in Jordan, which creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information, because 
it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require 
Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The existence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, who are citizens of and reside in Jordan comes within 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I conclude that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's family does not constitute an unacceptable security risk. 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because all of Applicant's family members now reside in the United States, with the exception of one brother, who is in the process of moving here, and there 
has been no</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> government involvement with any of these family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">MC E2.A2.1.3.1. applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN></P>
