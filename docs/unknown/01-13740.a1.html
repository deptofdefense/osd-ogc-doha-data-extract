  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence.  Most of the Judge's factual findings are sustainable.  The factual errors identified by Applicant are harmless.  The Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines is reasonable in light of the  Judge's sustainable factual findings.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued a decision dated July 31, 2002 in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: 1. Did the Judge make errors in his findings of fact?; 2. Did the Judge fail to consider pertinent record 
evidence?; and 3. Did the Judge apply the Adjudicative Guidelines properly?  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse 
security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant dated February 6, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Appellant declined a hearing and the case was decided on the 
administrative record.  The Administrative Judge issued an unfavorable decision dated July 31, 2002.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from 
that decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found Applicant had ten recent delinquent accounts, with seven still unpaid.  The Judge also found Applicant had made two 
inadequately explained false statements on his security application.  The Judge concluded that the matters were disqualifying under Guidelines F, E and J.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">1.Did the Judge make errors in his findings of fact?</SPAN>  Applicant challenges many of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact.  These may be broken down into 
several categories.  Applicant essentially argues that: (a) the Judge made a factual mistake concerning Applicant's age; (b) the Judge erred in finding that 
Applicant has had $1,641.00 per month available to him to pay off his delinquent debts; (c) the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had failed to satisfy certain 
debts: (d) the Judge erred in finding that Applicant engaged in willful falsifications when he omitted certain information about his delinquent debts from his 
security questionnaire; and (e) the Judge erred by failing to give due consideration to  favorable evidence about Applicant's character and job performance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes the Judge misstated Applicant's age in the synopsis of the decision.  However, the Judge correctly stated Applicant's age in the body 
of the decision, and a reading of the Judge's decision as a whole persuades the Board that this error is harmless because the Judge's adverse conclusions do not 
turn on Applicant's age.  Applicant persuasively argues the Judge's findings concerning SOR paragraphs 1.g and 1.h are erroneous.  However, the Judge's 
remaining findings about Applicant's history of financial difficulties and falsification of the security questionnaire reflect a reasonable interpretation of the 
record evidence and are sustainable.  Given the totality of the Judge's sustainable findings about Applicant's history of financial difficulties and falsification of 
the security questionnaire, the Judge's factual errors concerning SOR paragraphs 1.g and 1.h are harmless.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">2. Did the Judge fail to consider pertinent record evidence?</SPAN>  Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider favorable record evidence including Applicant's 
uncorroborated statements that several of the debts were now satisfied, Applicant's statements that the false answers on his security clearance application were 
errors rather than intentional lies, and a letter from his supervisor.  There is a rebuttable  presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record 
evidence.  The Judge is not required to discuss or give the same weight to each piece of evidence.  A review of the Judge's findings and conclusions 
demonstrates that the decision (except for a few harmless errors) represents a sustainable interpretation of the record.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate that 
the Judge failed to consider the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also claims the Administrative Judge had several procedural options available to him that, had they been exercised, would have cast his case in a 
more favorable light.  Specifically, Applicant asserts that if the Judge chose not to believe Applicant's version of events, the Judge (1) could have granted 
Applicant more time to provide proof of his debt payments; (2) could have requested another investigation by another investigative party; or (3) could have 
placed Applicant on probation.  Regarding a time extension to allow further development of the record, Applicant's assertion is untimely as the record in the 
case below does not indicate he made such a request directly to the Judge.  Moreover, requests for time extensions are largely within the discretion of the 
Administrative Judge.  Applicant fails to establish the Judge erred in this instance.  Regarding the proposals concerning an additional investigation and the 
placement of Applicant on probation, the Directive does not authorize DOHA Administrative Judges to engage in either of these acts.  Applicant's arguments 
concerning them therefore fail to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">3. Did the Judge apply the Adjudicative Guidelines properly?</SPAN>  Applicant disputes the Administrative Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines to 
Applicant's case.  To a great extent Applicant's claims are predicated on his interpretation of the facts of the case.  Since the Administrative Judge did not share 
Applicant's view that the record showed Applicant's debts were paid and that his false statements were explained as errors, it follows that the Judge applied the 
Adjudicative Guidelines in accord with his view of underlying facts rather than Applicant's view.  The Judge articulated a rational analysis of Applicant's case 
that is founded on his generally sustainable view of the record evidence.  He concluded that Applicant's misconduct was pertinent, recent, and not isolated.  The 
Judge concluded that Applicant's conduct was disqualifying and unmitigated under Guidelines F, E, and J.  Applicant's alternative analysis of his situation, 
relying on a different interpretation of the record evidence fails to demonstrate the Judge erred in applying the Adjudicative Guidelines.</P>
