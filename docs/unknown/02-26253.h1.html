<P>Between 1995 and 1998, Applicant was arrested six times for drug- and alcohol-related offenses. His adverse alcohol-related conduct and his involvement with 
illegal drugs are mitigated by the passage of time; however, Applicant deliberately omitted his use of marijuana between 1995 and 1997, as well as all but one 
of his arrests from a recent security clearance application (SF-86), because he was concerned about the adverse consequences such information might have on 
his ability to get a clearance. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On August 11, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns about his criminal and personal conduct, alcohol consumption, and involvement with 
illegal drugs. The SOR informed him DOHA adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding, based on available information, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On October 10, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), admitted all of the allegations therein, and requested a determination without a hearing. On 
January 16, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) with 11 exhibits (Items 1 - 11) attached in support of the 
government's preliminary decision. A copy of the FORM was sent to Applicant on July 15, 2004, and the Applicant timely submitted an undated response to 
which Department Counsel did not object. The case was assigned to me on August 11, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 27-year-old senior network engineer employed by a defense contractor full-time since March 2002. This appears to be his first application for a 
security clearance, but he has worked in the information technology field, primarily as a network engineer, continuously since at least October 1995.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking during his senior year in high school. He drank every weekend, usually to intoxication, after consuming between seven and ten beers. 
After his arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI), discussed below, he abstained from alcohol altogether until October 1999. As of April 2002, his drinking 
consisted of going to happy hour with co-workers twice monthly and consuming three or four beers each time.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 1995, Applicant was cited for illegal possession of alcohol, a misdemeanor. He was 18 at the time, but the legal age for drinking in his state was 
21. Applicant appeared in court, was found or pled guilty, and paid a fine.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 12, 1996, Applicant was cited for reckless driving, a misdemeanor; specifically, he was driving in excess of 80 miles per hour. In court, he was 
convicted, his driver's license was suspended for 30 days, and he was fined $1,500, all but $200 of which was suspended.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 12, 1996, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was convicted in March 1997, given a 30-day suspended jail sentence, 
assessed a $3,000 fine, and ordered to attend an alcohol safety awareness program (ASAP). His driver's license was suspended for 12 months.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1997, Applicant was charged with simple possession of marijuana. Applicant was holding almost one-half ounce of marijuana for a friend. Two 
months later, Applicant was also charged with felony possession of a controlled substance after the marijuana confiscated from him tested positive for 
phencyclidine (PCP). When Applicant appeared in court in November 1997, the earlier charge of simple possession was <EM>nolle prosequi </EM>and entry of judgment 
withheld as to the felony possession charge. Applicant was placed on one year supervised probation, which included random drug screening. He was also 
ordered to enroll in intensive outpatient alcohol and drug services (ADS) treatment from April 1998 through August 1998. Due to a DWI arrest in August 1998 
(discussed below), Applicant was re-enrolled in the ADS program from October 1998 through July 1999. During this time, he was also ordered to attend ASAP 
sessions and his probation was twice extended to allow him to complete these programs. Applicant was released from probation in December 1999.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 14, 1997, just before his 20<SUP>th</SUP> birthday, Applicant was charged with driving on a suspended or revoked driver's license. His license had been 
suspended for 12 months as part of his sentence for the aforementioned DWI conviction in March 1997. He was jailed for two days, assessed a $100 fine, and 
his driver's license was suspended for an additional 90 days.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 1998, Applicant was arrested for DWI while still on probation for his June 1997 felony drug possession arrest. (He had been drinking at the house 
of the same friend who had given him the marijuana he was convicted of possessing.) Applicant was convicted, given a 30-day suspended jail sentence, fined 
$600, ordered to attend ASAP, and his driver's license was suspended for 12 months.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana between 15 and 20 times from 1995 until his arrest in June 1997, when he was 19 years old. He no longer associates with his friends 
who use drugs and does not intend to use marijuana in the future.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 18, 2002, Applicant submitted an SF-86. In response to question 24 regarding alcohol- or drug-related charges or convictions, he disclosed his 1998 
DWI arrest and conviction. However, he omitted his 1995 arrest for illegal possession of alcohol, his 1996 DWI arrest, and his 1997 drug possession arrest.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also answered "no" to question 21 regarding felony arrests, but it is clear from his own statements in the pre-sentencing reports that he knew the 
earlier simple possession charge was being changed to a more serious charge.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant also answered "no" to question 27 regarding illegal drug use. The 
question covers any use of illegal drugs, including marijuana, during the preceding seven years; in this case, to March 18, 1995. Yet Applicant used marijuana 
between 1995 and 1997.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to question 26, which addresses arrests, charges or convictions not listed in other SF-86 questions concerning criminal conduct, Applicant answered 
"no." However, he should have listed his 1996 reckless driving arrest and his 1997 arrest for driving on a suspended license. Applicant also failed to list, in 
response to question 30 regarding alcohol-related treatment or counseling. He claims he did not list his ADS treatment because it was delivered on an outpatient 
basis.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 18, 2002, Applicant told a Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator he did not list his felony drug conviction on his SF-86 on advice of counsel. 
He had been told that if he stayed out of trouble during his one-year probation, the charges would be dismissed and the record of his arrest would be expunged. 
However, because Applicant was convicted of DWI during that year, his probation was twice extended, each time for six months. The charges were dismissed 
in December 1999, but there is no mention in the court records of any action to expunge or otherwise seal the record . In the same interview, Applicant also told 
the investigator he did not disclose his marijuana use because he was concerned such a disclosure might prevent him from getting his clearance, and he "didn't 
want [his marijuana] use to uncover that charge of the marijuana and PCP possession."<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the pre-sentencing report for his 1997 drug arrest, Applicant's mother described him as a good person and conscientious worker who nonetheless had trouble 
maturing.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Applicant recently married his girlfriend of five years. They are trying to start a family and have bought a house. They both have full-time careers 
(she is a teacher), and Applicant ended his  association with his high school friends with whom he used drugs and alcohol in about 1998.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline H (illegal drug 
involvement), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion on the issue of whether, despite the government's information, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern (Guideline G) because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has established a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. Between 1995 and 1998, Applicant was convicted of three alcohol-related crimes. (SOR 2.a) There is also 
evidence that he abused alcohol for a period of about four years starting when he was a senior in high school. After his two DWI arrests, he was ordered to 
attend ASAP sessions, and, in connection with his 1997 drug possession arrest, he was ordered to attend alcohol and drug outpatient counseling, which was 
extended for an additional 10 months after his 1998 DWI conviction. (SOR 2.b and 2.c) Guideline G disqualifying condition (DC)  1<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 5<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant abstained from alcohol from about October 1998 until October 1999. Since then, the only available information indicates Applicant's 
drinking has moderated and there is no indication he drives after drinking. The SOR alleges he has continued to drink even after he completed the court-ordered 
ASAP sessions and ADS treatment. (SOR 2.d) While this is a relevant fact, because there is no evidence Applicant was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or 
alcohol dependent, I do not conclude it works to disqualify Applicant. Further, there is no indication of a current problem insofar as Applicant has not 
experienced any adverse alcohol-related conduct or incidents in over six years. The record also contains information which indicates positive lifestyle changes 
in support of sobriety. Applicant has continued to work without interruption in his chosen profession, he has severed ties with former friends with whom he 
drank and abused drugs, and he has assumed added responsibilities of marriage and home ownership. Guideline G mitigating condition (MC) 2<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> 
apply here. On balance, I believe Applicant's abuse of alcohol is no longer a part of his life and, based on the absence of adverse alcohol-related conduct since 
1998, that he is unlikely to repeat this conduct in the future. I find for Applicant as to the allegations contained in SOR paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Involvement with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">illegal drugs is a security concern (Guideline H) because it </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> The illegality of this conduct further undermines the government's confidence that an applicant who is involved with drugs can be relied on to 
follow rules and procedures for safeguarding classified information. The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. 
Applicant used marijuana several times between 1995 and 1997 (SOR 3.a) and was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 1997. (SOR 3.b) 
Guideline H DC 1<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, there is no indication Applicant has used marijuana or any other illegal substance since 1997. Applicant was 20 years old at the time and was 
associating with at least one friend with whom he used drugs and alcohol. On two occasions, his association with one friend directly resulted in Applicant's 
arrest, once for DWI (SOR 1.a) and once for drug possession (SOR 1.c and 1.d). Applicant no longer runs in these circles and is unlikely to become involved 
with drugs in the future. Guideline H MC 1<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> and MC 3<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> apply here. The same change of circumstances that make it unlikely he will be involved with illegal 
drugs again also support a conclusion Applicant will not abuse alcohol or be involved in alcohol-related incidents in the future. I find for Applicant as to the 
allegations in SOR paragraph 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct is a security concern (Guideline J) because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness. A person who is willing to disregard laws intended to protect society may also disregard rules and procedures intended to protect classified 
information. The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. Between 1995 and 1998, Applicant was twice 
convicted of DWI (SOR 1.a and 1.e).He was also charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana (SOR 1.d), a charge that was later changed  to felony 
possession of a controlled substance, for which he was placed on probation for over two years. (SOR 1.c). Applicant was also convicted of reckless driving 
(SOR 1.f), driving on a suspended driver's license (SOR 1.b), and illegal possession of alcohol as a minor (SOR 1.g). These facts support application of 
Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> and DC 2.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In weighing availability of the listed Guideline J mitigating conditions, MC 1<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> and MC 6<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> might apply. Applicant's last arrest was over six years ago and his 
probation ended in December 1999. He has also made significant changes in his life as noted above. While he may be credited with leaving behind his drug and 
alcohol problems, as discussed below under Guideline E, Applicant recently, deliberately, and repeatedly falsified his SF-86. He also made a false statement to 
a DSS agent during a subject interview. This conduct is a violation of federal law under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which makes it a felony to make a false statement or 
representation to a U.S. agency concerning a matter within its jurisdiction. When Applicant signed his SF-86, an advisement about the applicability of this 
statute was printed clearly just above the signature line. The written statement he gave to DSS (Item 6) also contained a similar advisement. Applicant's conduct 
in this regard negates application of either MC 1 or MC 2 and severely undermines the government's confidence in his judgment and reliability relative to 
abiding by rules for safeguarding classified information. I find against the Applicant as to the allegations in SOR paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct (Guideline E)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government is concerned with Applicant's 
allegedly deliberate falsification of a security clearance application and has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his 
Answer, Applicant admits he falsified his answers to SF-86 questions regarding his criminal conduct SOR 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d), his drug use (SOR 4.a), and 
alcohol-related treatment and counseling (SOR 4.e). He also told a DSS agent he did not disclose his drug use because he was afraid it would lead to discovery 
of his 1997 drug possession arrest and would hurt his chances of getting a clearance. Also significant, although not alleged, is Applicant's statement to DSS that 
he did not get into to trouble while on probation between from November 1997 through at least November 1998, when the record clearly shows he was arrested 
for DWI in August 1998. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring applicants for clearance can be relied on to be candid in responding to inquiries 
about their background, even if it means disclosing information that may be adverse to their personal interests. The facts here support application of Guideline 
E DC 2<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> and DC 3.<A HREF="02-26253.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's falsifications cannot be mitigated on these facts. They are recent, multiple, and there was no effort made to correct them. If anything, 
Applicant attempted to minimize his criminal conduct by lying about his conduct while on probation. I find against the Applicant as to the allegations in SOR 
paragraph 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These facts raise reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. While Applicant should be lauded for leaving his drug and alcohol problems behind and for the 
changes he has made in his life, his ongoing criminal conduct and lack of candor prolong the government's concerns about his judgment and reliability. Absent 
substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I conclude the record evidence weighs in favor of the government's decision 
to deny Applicant access to classified information.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
