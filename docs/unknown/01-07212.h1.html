<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 29, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 15, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on September 27, 2001, and 
was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on October 12,  2001, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant 
relied on two witnesses (including himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on October 22, 2001.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year old president of a soft-ware defense contractor whose</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> government contracts are entirely devoted to domestic work: it does no work 
overseas (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 30).  He </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> seeks retention of his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have (1) exercised dual citizenship with Pakistan and the US, (2) reapplied for a Pakistani passport in October 1998 even though he had 
become a naturalized US citizen in February 1986 and received a Pakistani passport which will not expire until October 2003, and (3) used his Pakistani 
passport instead of his US passport when entering and exiting Pakistan in at least 1993.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have a father and two brothers, both citizens and residents of Pakistan, with whom he maintains regular contact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to most of the allegations covered by foreign preference, but denied exercising dual citizenship or using his 
Pakistani passport to enter or exit Pakistan in 1993 or at any other time after becoming a US citizen.  He claimed a willingness to renounce his Pakistani 
citizenship if necessary and to already have surrendered his Pakistani passport to the Pakistani deputy chief of mission in June 2001.  Applicant claimed his 
major reason for renewing his Pakistani passport in 1998 was to ease his ability to obtain a travel visa to travel to Pakistan, and not to enter/exit Pakistan or any 
other checkpoint to Pakistan.  He claimed that had he known that his possessing a Pakistani passport could create a security clearance issue, he would not have 
renewed it.  Applicant claimed he used his US passport to travel to Pakistan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Addressing the foreign influence issues, Applicant admitted to his father and two brothers being citizens and residents of Pakistan, but denied any exposure to 
influence/duress by reason of his father and brothers being citizens and residents of Pakistan.  He claimed to have sponsored his parents and brothers to become 
permanent US residents, but because his mother died in 1988 and his father is aged and in poor health, they never accepted US residency.  He claimed his 
brothers and their families still  intend to become permanent US residents.  Applicant claimed, too, that he has no financial assets in Pakistan, owns no property 
there, maintains no bank or stock accounts there and has not voted in a Pakistani election since becoming a US citizen.  He claimed by contrast to have voted 
regularly in US elections since becoming a US citizen, to be married to a US citizen by birth, to have two children who are US citizens by birth, to have a home 
and other assets in the US  and to be actively involved in his community, both individually and through his company, which sponsors an annual charity golf 
course to fund leukemia research.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  
Additional findings follow.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born and reared in Pakistan to Pakistani parents, Applicant emigrated to the US in 1975 at the age of 21 to pursue college studies in information technology.  
Before emigrating to the US, he never served in the Pakistani military.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon emigrating to the US in 1975,  Applicant pursued a technical curriculum.  He graduated from a local university in 1977 with a BS degree in information 
systems and began his professional career </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as a computer programmer with a local employer.  Over the course of the ensuing 10 years, he worked his way up the 
corporate management chain, first to manager, and then to project director, before he left his company in 1988 to found his own company, which specializes in 
two defined areas: software development, maintenance and enhancement is one area, and infrastructure support network management, desktop support provide 
the other area of emphasis.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married in 1982 to Ms. A, who is a US citizen by birth.  He  has two children by his spouse: ages 5 and 2.  Applicant and his spouse have lived in the 
same  area of their established US community since 1985 and have owned their home since 1988.  All of Applicant's financial assets (including his home, bank 
accounts, insurance plans, stock accounts and 401(k) plan) are located and administered in the US.  Since becoming a US citizen, he has voted only in US 
elections, a privilege of US citizenship he has regularly exercised (R.T., at 49).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides voting in US federal, state and local elections since becoming a citizen, Applicant  has been very active and instrumental in raising money for charity, 
both personally and through his company.  His company (which employs over 200 employees), for instance, sponsors an annual charity golf tournament to raise 
money for leukemia research (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 26, 34).  Applicant encourages his company employees to stay involved in community activities and programs with 
their voluntary efforts (R.T., at 36). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents were born in India and became Pakistani citizens by virtue of the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.  His mother and father were both 
physicians in the Pakistani Army traveled extensively throughout the world for educational and work-related purposes.  Applicant has two brothers: The eldest 
(a retiree of the Pakistani Army) is an operations manager for a Pakistani telecommunications company;  the younger brother is a physician who has never been 
in the Pakistani military or government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Soon after he became a US citizen, Applicant sponsored his parents and brothers for permanent residence in the US.  But although his parents were approved 
for permanent residency in 1987, his mother died in 1988; while his elderly father (who is in poor health) is unable to travel. Applicant anticipates both his 
brothers emigrating to the US within the foreseeable future (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 31-33).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Hopeful of taking advantage of a more streamlined visa process in place for persons who previously resided in Pakistan (and for no other purpose), Applicant 
renewed his Pakistani passport in 1988, after he had become a US citizen and obtained a US passport.  At the time of his making application, he had no 
intention of using his renewed Pakistani passport to enter or exit Pakistan.  To date, he has not used his foreign passport (R.T., at 39-40).  On the two occasions 
he has traveled  since renewing his Pakistani passport, he traveled to Pakistan (in 1993 and again in 1998) to visit his family.  In both instances, he used his US 
passport to enter and exit the country (<EM>compare </EM>exs. B and D with R.T., at 43-45).  At the time of issuance of the SOR, his Pakistani passport carried an October 
2003 expiration date (<EM>see</EM> ex. E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2001, Applicant took concrete steps toward renouncing his Pakistani citizenship and surrendering his Pakistani passport.  Pakistan's embassy official 
responsible for receiving surrendered passports acknowledged Applicant's surrender of his Pakistani passport later in June 2001 (<EM>see</EM> ex. G).  He feels no 
allegiance or obligation to Pakistan (R.T., at 40) since taking his oath of allegiance as a US citizen.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant does harbor some fears for the safety of his family residing in Pakistan in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001 (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 50-51), he 
has no reason to believe that either his father or brothers and family members currently residing in Pakistan are at risk to foreign pressure or influence to obtain 
classified information from Applicant or the US (R.T., at 41, 56).  But if were pressures were ever exerted on his family members, he would work with US 
authorities to resolve the problem (R.T., at 54).   He received  no assistance of any kind from Pakistani authorities in the processing of  his US residency 
sponsorship application in behalf of his parents and brothers. Applicant assures he has no reason to return to Pakistan to reside and has unwavering loyalty to 
the US.  His assurances are credible and accepted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With his wife and children all US citizens by birth, and with all of his material possessions being in the US, he is totally committed to protecting US interests to 
the mutual exclusion of Pakistan were an inter-state conflict to develop.  Applicant persuades that he cannot be subjected to foreign influence under any 
perceived set of circumstances.   True, he does profess to have regular contact with his family members residing in Pakistan.  But he has no immediate plans to 
travel to Pakistan to see them in the foreseeable future and is considered unlikely to do so under the present circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: The exercise of dual citizenship</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2: Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 4: Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in 
large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a 
reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a  naturalized US citizen who after being born and raised in Pakistan emigrated to the US in 1977 to pursue educational opportunities.  In accepting 
US citizenship in 1986, he did not renounce his Pakistani citizenship, and later (in 1998) applied for a renewal of his Pakistani passport, unaware at the time 
that either his dual citizenship or possessing a Pakistani passport could jeopardize his US-issued security clearance.   Made aware of the security implications of 
holding dual citizenship, he renounced his Pakistani citizenship this year.  Security issues are raised over Applicant's dual citizenship exercise and his 
possession of a Pakistani passport.  Issues of security concern encompass as well his having immediate family members with Pakistani citizenship and 
residence who could be at risk to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, such that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference for the interests of the 
foreign country over the interests of the US.  While dual citizenship itself is not a <EM>per se </EM>disqualifier for a security clearance, its active exercise can be.  The 
issues raise concerns over Applicant's preference for a foreign country over the US.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, the primary issue is whether Applicant by renewing his Pakistani passport in 1998  and not renouncing his Pakistani citizenship and taking steps to 
surrender his Pakistani passport until after clearance procedures were initiated against him reveal a  preference for his birthplace (Pakistan) over his adopted 
country (the US).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Without denying continuing affections for his birthplace, as well as the current place of residence of his father and brothers, Applicant insists his preference 
remains for US, which he would never compromise under any circumstances, should competing geopolitical interests develop between the two countries.  
Certainly, Applicant manifested his support for the US in several important ways since taking his oath of allegiance in 1986: He has never served in Pakistani's 
military or voted in any of its elections; he owns no property or other financial interests in Pakistan; and he has never accepted any benefits or privileges from 
Pakistan since becoming a US citizen.  Applicant is university trained in the US; he owns a home in the US; and he has voted regularly in US elections.  His US 
preference credits also include his founding his own company which currently employs over 250 persons, contributing regularly and substantially (both through 
his company and individually) to major US charities, and using his US passport exclusively when traveling to Pakistan to see his family, or other countries 
abroad.   Both his wife and young children are US citizens by birth.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So even though Applicant renewed his Pakistani passport in 1998, he has never used it in any of his travels abroad.   Advised that his possessing a Pakistani 
passport posed a major security concern under the clarifying guidelines of the memorandum issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, 
Control, Communication and Intelligence (ASDC3I), dated August 16, 2000, entitled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the 
Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline (<EM>hereinafter</EM> "Money memo"), Applicant unconditionally renounced his Pakistan citizenship and 
surrendered his Pakistani passport (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  No  conclusions warrant that Applicant at any time since his becoming a US citizen manifested a preference for 
any country but the US.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the evidence presented in the record, Applicant mitigates any security concerns raised by his passive holding of dual citizenship with 
another country (Pakistan), averts any risk of recurrent dual citizenship questions by his renouncement of his Pakistani citizenship and convinces that his 
acceptance of a renewed Pakistani passport (however brief) does not expose him to future risks of providing information that could be harmful to the security 
interests of the US.  His essentially passive holding of dual citizenship over a fifteen-year span between 1986 and 2001 (broken only by his renewal of his 
Pakistani passport in 1998) creates no competing allegiance concerns for Applicant that might otherwise exist for clearance holders that manifest that exhibit 
active dual citizenship.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.c of Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government concerns over the risk of Applicant's father and brothers (who are each citizens of Pakistan who reside in Pakistan) being subject to coercion or 
pressure are also present.  Because Applicant's father and brothers remain Pakistani citizens and residents, his immediate family members may present security 
risks covered by disqualifying condition (DC) 1 of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The citizen/residence status of these relatives in Pakistan 
pose some potential concerns because of the risks of coercion or influence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or 
control. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">                   The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate p<EM>er se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with 
relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  
While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security 
investigations continue to be governed by the same Change 2 requirements of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R for appraising the security risks associated with the 
individual's having family abroad.  These investigatory requirements of the Regulation as they pertain to hostage situations were never deleted or replaced</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and retain their applicability according to the dictates of individual cases.  <EM>See </EM>32 C.F.R. Sec. l54.8 (1998) (corresponds to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Sec. 2-403).<A HREF="01-07212.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  And Section 6.1 of the Directive (under procedures) provides that industrial security clearance applicants be investigated in accordance with the 
standards in the governing DoD regulation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Whatever potential security risks arise as the result of Applicant's having immediate family members in Pakistan, they are by every reasonable measure 
mitigated.  Applicant's situation is in marked contrast to a situation where an applicant's family reside in a country whose interests are considered inimical to 
those of the US.  Pakistan is not a hostile country, but a country who enjoys allied support with the US in their current joint security efforts.  Put another way, 
Pakistan is not a country hostile to the security interests of the US, but a country whose political  institutions (while not democratic at present) are sufficiently 
aligned with our own traditions (which include the rule of law) to absolve Applicant of any foreseeable security risk.  While the foreign influence provisions of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the nature of the subject country, they should not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and 
policies of the particular foreign regime involved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of the presence of Applicant's immediate family members in Pakistan (a country whose interests have recently been friendly to those of the US), any 
potential risk of a hostage situation becomes unlikely, or at the very least, an acceptable one.  The mitigation benefits of MC 1 (presence of immediate family in 
host country poses no unacceptable security risk) of the Adjudicative Guidelines are fully available to Applicant herein.   Applicant may also claim the 
mitigation benefits of MC 5 (minimal foreign financial interests).  Overall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having immediate family 
members in Pakistan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure 
attributable to his familial relationships in Pakistan.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a of Guideline B.</SPAN></P>
