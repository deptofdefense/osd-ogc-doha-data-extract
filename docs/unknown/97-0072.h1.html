<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On 12 February 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="97-0072.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 3 March 1997, Applicant answered the SOR and requested
an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's File of
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 25 March 1997; the record in this case closed 4 May 1997,
the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 2 June 1997. I received
the case on 16 June 1997 to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or
revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR, except for denying any intent to
use marijuana in the future (subparagraph 1.c.), and denying the conclusory allegations of
paragraphs 1. and 2; accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 39-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified
information.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	On 5 February 1995, Applicant falsified a Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ)(DD
Form 398)(Item 4) when he answered "no" to questions designed to elicit his drug abuse history.<A HREF="97-0072.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
During a subject interview on 17 July 1996, Applicant repeated his denials of any drug
involvement, although he did explain the marijuana possession charge on the 1987 DWI (Item 5,
6).<A HREF="97-0072.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> On 6 November 1996 (Item 7), Applicant acknowledged that he had not correctly reported
his use of marijuana: Applicant first used marijuana at age 18 (1976) and until age 28 (1986)
used marijuana an average of once or twice monthly. Since 1986, Applicant has used marijuana
approximately twice yearly, most recently in August 1996.<A HREF="97-0072.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> He stated an intent to continue to use
marijuana at the same rate in the future.</P>

<P>	In his Answer (Item 3), Applicant now claims that he used marijuana twice yearly--vice
monthly--from 1976 to 1987, and only three times between 1987 and August 1996. He admits
withholding information because of fear his company would find out.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT (CRITERION H)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>		(3) . . . Current drug involvement, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use,
will normally result in an unfavorable determination.</P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</P>

<P>		(2) the drug involvement was an isolated or infrequent event;</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(2) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
		from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar
form 		used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or 		trustworthiness. . .;</P>

<P>		(3) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
		material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a personnel security or 		trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion H. Applicant's twenty year history
of drug abuse--in apparent disregard of the illegality of that drug abuse--raises serious doubts about
his fitness for access to classified information. His Answer attempts to drastically revise his
marijuana abuse history and greatly undercuts his credibility, both about the extent of his drug use
and his now-stated intent to refrain from drug use in the future. Given the circumstances of his drug
abuse over the years, I conclude Applicant is likely to use marijuana at social functions in the future.
However, Applicant's plea to the drug charge in 1987 fails to establish that the marijuana belonged
to Applicant, and I find paragraph 1.b. for Applicant. The balance of criterion H. I find against
Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria E. The information sought by the
Government on the PSQ and during the subject interview was relevant and material to the
Government's investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, and the
Applicant knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. The Applicant's failure to fully disclose
his drug abuse history until he was confronted with a second DIS interview suggests that he cannot
be relied upon to speak the truth if the truth presents possible adverse consequences for his own
interests. He knew the answers he provided were false; and indeed he knew the answers had to be
false for him to get what he wanted--a security clearance. At no time before the second interview
did Applicant make any effort to fully disclose his drug abuse history, much less a prompt, good
faith effort. I find criterion E. against the Applicant.<A HREF="97-0072.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Although he also failed to disclose a 25 July 1981 DWI arrest and failed to disclose that his 17 May 1987 DWI
arrest also involved marijuana possession charges, I find that neither omission is disqualifying under the Directive. The
omission of the July 1981 DWI is consistent with Applicant's stated--but mistaken--belief that the Government only
wanted arrests within the last ten years. Further, while he may have deliberately failed to disclose the drug connection
to the May 1987 DWI arrest, that omission could not--as a matter of fact--affect the course of the Government's
investigation. Applicant correctly, if not completely, disclosed the date, location, and nature of the offense. That
disclosure was enough to ensure that the Government would discover whatever information was available to be
discovered about that offense. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant steadfastly maintains that the marijuana belonged to the passenger in Applicant's car; Applicant's
plea  to "operating with drugs in a motor vehicle" is not inconsistent with this claim.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Although Applicant admits misleading the DIS agent during this interview (Answer, 2.d.), his sworn statement
(Item 7) contains no corroboration of this statement.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>I find paragraph 2.a.(1) for Applicant because Applicant identified the pertinent details of the 1987 arrest
which permitted DIS to investigate; Applicant's omission of the drug charge could not have affected DIS' action. I find
paragraph 2.a.(2) for Applicant because Applicant mistakenly believed that DIS wanted only information from the last
10 years. I find  paragraph 2.d. for Applicant because the Government's evidence does not conclusively establish either
the fact of the misrepresentation (Applicant's statement conflicts with his answer) or that Applicant intended to mislead
the agent (Applicant's answer states he had difficulty remembering his last marijuana use; Agent did not consider the
discrepancy--if any--worth recording in the sworn statement.).
