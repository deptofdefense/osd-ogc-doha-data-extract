<P>Applicant entered into a five-year spouse-like relationship with an illegal alien shortly after terminating a relationship with her ex-husband, who was also an 
illegal alien.  Such conduct raised personal conduct concerns.  Her knowing violation of federal law pertaining to harboring an illegal alien and subsequent 
claim she did not know the man she had a second relationship with was an illegal alien raises concerns about her judgment, trustworthiness, and willingness to 
comply with rules and regulations.  Applicant was unable to mitigate personal conduct concerns raised.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 4, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-19136.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-19136.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-Applicant 
failed to meet the personal conduct (Guideline E) personnel security guidelines of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 26, 
2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on October 30, 2003, however, due 
to caseload considerations was reassigned to me on March 5, 2004.  On April 9, 2004, I convened a hearing via video-teleconference to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered three documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3.  The Applicant offered six 
documents, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and F.  During the video-teleconference hearing, Applicant requested to 
submit four additional documents.  Those additional documents were timely received by facsimile and admitted without objection as AE G through J.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on April 21, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 27-year-old single mother, who has two young children, a seven-year-old daughter, and a four-year-old son.  Applicant is a high school graduate. 
She is employed as a personnel security specialist for a defense contractor and has worked for her employer since April 2002.  She was initially hired as a 
dispatcher, a position she held for six months before assuming her present position.  She seeks a security clearance in conjunction with her job requirements.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was previously married from December 1997 to June 2001, to a man who was an illegal alien.  GE 1, p. 5.  Applicant's first and now ex-husband is 
the father of her daughter.  Applicant testified she had no reason to believe her ex-husband was an illegal alien because he was employed when she met him.  
Tr. 46.  She further testified she did not learn her ex-husband was an illegal alien until she was pregnant with their daughter.  Tr. 46.  Applicant's ex-husband 
provides $200.00 monthly child support for their daughter.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, Applicant became involved in a long term spouse like relationship with another man (ex-boyfriend) for approximately five years.  Tr. 38.  Her ex-boyfriend was also an illegal alien.  Applicant testified she did not know he was an illegal alien until she was pregnant with her son.  Tr. 32.  Applicant further 
testified her ex-boyfriend lost his job because his employer discovered he did not have a green card.  Tr. 41.  Her son was born in June 2001.  Tr. 33.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) in May 2002.  The Defense Security Service interviewed Applicant two times.  The first time was 
in May 2002 and the second time was shortly thereafter at Applicant's request.  Applicant indicated in both interviews she was aware her ex-boyfriend was an 
illegal alien.  Tr. 21.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2003, Applicant and her ex-boyfriend rented an apartment together.  He was not employed at the time and she knew he was an illegal alien.  Tr. 42-43.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed her SCA, she listed her ex-boyfriend under "Current spouse-like relationship" and his country of citizenship (not United States).  
GE 1, p. 6.  Tr. 33.  Applicant testified she first became aware that having her ex-boyfriend in her life was a security problem when she began her current 
position as personnel security specialist.  Tr. 33.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant separated from her ex-boyfriend in May 2003 and subsequently severed her relationship with him.  Tr. 44, 49-50, 59, 64.  After separating from him, 
she began a new relationship with another man in late fall 2003.  Tr. 45.  He is a United States citizen.  Tr. 46.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Referring to her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Applicant testified, "When I was involved with him I was not fully aware of the seriousness of this matter.  I 
no longer have a personal relationship with him."  Tr. 31.  When she became aware her relationship with her ex-boyfriend was a problem, she sought guidance 
from her company's business manager and director or human resources.  Tr.  55.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2003, Applicant filed for and received a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend as well as the necessary paperwork to establish a parental relationship 
and custody of her son and set up a separate household with herself and two children.  AE G through J.  Applicant's relationship with her ex-boyfriend had 
become violent, which prompted her to request a restraining order in June 2003.  AE G, AE J.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had an informal 
arrangement with her ex-boyfriend regarding child support and visitation.  Tr. 50.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statute provides that such conduct is a felony.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant lived in a spouse-like relationship with an illegal alien from 1999 to 2002 and that during that time knowingly harbored 
an illegal alien in violation of 8 U.S.C.1324, &sect; 274.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and in part through Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR.  Applicant's 
explanation that she did not knowingly harbor an illegal alien might carry more weight were it not for her history.  Applicant was previously married to an 
illegal alien from December 1977 to June 2001.  She claims she did not know her ex-husband was an illegal alien until she was pregnant with her daughter, 
which would have been in approximately 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, Applicant became involved with another man, who was an illegal alien.  She was involved with him in a five-year relationship and had a son with him 
in 2001.  She also claims she did not know her ex-husband was an illegal alien until she was pregnant with her son.  She maintained a relationship with him 
until May 2003 and admits she knew he was an illegal alien from 2001 to 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2002, she began her job with her current employer and six months later assumed a position with her employer that required a security clearance.  It was 
at this point, her relationship with her ex-boyfriend came under scrutiny.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanation of not knowing her ex-boyfriend was an illegal alien might have been more plausible were it not for the fact she had just gotten out of a 
relationship with her ex-husband, who was also an illegal alien.  What Applicant suggests is that she did not engage in the usual and customary background 
inquiries one might ask in such situations.  This conversation would been particularly pertinent in her case given her very recent experience with her ex-husband.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Clearly, the issue of being associated with an illegal alien became a concern to Applicant when she assumed her current position.  Until then, the evidence 
suggests her association with either man and their illegal alien status was not of concern to her.  Although she is no longer involved with the two men who are 
the fathers of her two children, she is likely to remain be involved with them because of their parental rights.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In short, Applicant's actions taken as a whole with regard to her ex-boyfriend constitute the knowing harboring of an illegal alien and a disregard for the law. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Conditions applicable: DC 4: Personal conduct . . . that increases an individuals's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress . . . .; DC 5: A 
pattern of . . . rule violations . . . .; and DC 6: Association with persons involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Conditions applicable: MC 5:  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
<EM>duress</EM>; and MC 7: Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Had Applicant not had two back-to-back relationships with illegal aliens within a short time, I may have been inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Her 
actions and choices speak for themselves.  One cannot engage in such behavior and expect to be entrusted with a security clearance.  To Applicant's credit, she 
is a valued and trusted employee and has taken steps to correct the problem.  Further time is be necessary to evaluate her future actions.  On balance and 
considering all the evidence, I find against Applicant on SOR &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on  applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, as set forth 
in the directive, to the evidence presented.  Under the Applicant's current circumstances a clearance is not warranted, but should the Applicant be afforded an 
opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness.  Additionally, this 
determination does not question the Applicant's patriotism and should not be seen as such.</SPAN></P>
