<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 20 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of financial 
consideration and personal conduct.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR 7 September 2005 and 3 October 2005, and requested a decision on the record. On 22 February 2006, she responded to DOHA's 12 
August 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed on 1 March 2006, when Department Counsel indicated no objection to the response. DOHA assigned the case to me 1 March 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR, except for the debts at 1.b., 1.f., 1.i., and 1.m--which she denied as being paid.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. 
She denied falsifying her clearance application. She is a 53-year-old administrative aide for a defense contractor since May 1978. She appears to have held a clearance since March 1992.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant submitted her clearance application in May 2003, she answered "no" to five questions (questions 34-38) seeking adverse financial information within the last seven years. She answered 
"yes" to question 39 (accounts currently 90+ days past due), and reported a single account for $425. In fact, she had five past due accounts totaling over $12,000 (1.b.-1.f). Applicant claimed that she 
did not believe the accounts were past due because she had been paying on each of them from time to time. However, this claim is not credible. The credit reports show the accounts charged off or sent 
to collection far enough in the past that Applicant had to know they were not current. Further, Applicant knew that she had been receiving collection letter from the creditors, and that she was not paying 
on each account every month.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial problems dating back to before March 1994, when she received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of her dischargeable debts. However, her financial problems 
continue. She attributes them to her ex-husband's medical problems as well as her own, but it is clear that she has not been a good money manager. The SOR alleges 13 debts totaling over $13,000, 
falling past due since her 1994 bankruptcy. But the record evidence shows that these are just the debts that were past due when the SOR was issues. The SOR does not reflect  debts that were seriously 
past due at various points during the background investigation that Applicant struggled to pay, but eventually did pay. Applicant has finally addressed each of the debts in the SOR in some fashion. 
Some have been paid, some settled in full for amounts substantially lower than the original debt, some have been addressed by repayment schedules or the resumption of regular payments. Tellingly, 
however, Applicant's response to the FORM contains documentation on two accounts that demonstrate her ongoing difficulties. Applicant provides a monthly statement on an account whose effective 
interest rate is 28% and whose approximately $2,200 balance is reduced less than $20 per month with a $70 payment. At that rate, it will take her more than nine years to pay off the account, assuming 
she stays current and adds no charges to the account. The documentation on a second account, alleged at 1.i., show an interest rate of over 21%, with an account balance that is growing because 
Applicant is charging more to the account than she is paying off monthly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence that Applicant is receiving credit counseling or other training to help her avoid financial problems in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect over $13,000 of delinquent debt acquired 
after Applicant's bankruptcy discharge in 1994.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The SOR allegations do not reflect a number of delinquent debts that Applicant was able to address during the course of her background investigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial difficulties are both recent<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and not isolated;<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> indeed they appear to be ongoing. Applicant's health issues and 
her ex-husband's health issues are circumstances beyond her control,<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> but her financial problems also include consequences of choices she has made in the past. There is no evidence that she has sought 
credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> While many of the debts in the SOR have been satisfied in some fashion after the SOR was issued and several others are under a 
repayment schedule, Applicant has been slow to address her debts, and has not demonstrated that she will be able to avoid financial difficulties in the future.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed the nature and extent of her financial 
problems, disclosing only one past due debt when there were at least five.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The one account she did disclose does not contain any information to suggest the extent of her financial problems. Further, 
none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was relevant to a clearance decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the falsifications were isolated, they were recent, and there is no 
evidence demonstrating that Applicant provided the correct information voluntarily.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> There is no evidence demonstrating that she corrected the falsification before being asked about it.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> There is no 
evidence to suggest that Applicant receive bad advice about what she was required to disclose on her clearance application.<A HREF="04-09487.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
