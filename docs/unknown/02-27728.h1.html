<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 29, 2003, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive
Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry </EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN>amended and modified, and Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In a sworn written statement, dated October 27, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations
set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.
Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on December 22, 2003. A complete
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of seven documents, was provided to
Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,
extenuation, or mitigation. He did not do so. The case was assigned to, and received by me on March
22, 2004. </P>

<P>	"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S.
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration
of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence
of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential
for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the
evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which
disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. 
<EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved
in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect;

could result in the compromise of classified information." Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1. Having

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has
established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign influence. Having established
such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which
refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under the Directive the Government has alleged a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC)
all of which relate directly or stem from his marriage to a citizen of Viet Nam and the various in-laws that he acquired by that marriage. The allegations set forth sufficient information to justify a
finding against Applicant under Guideline B. (DC 2) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

are not agents of a foreign power that might mitigate the allegation (MC 1) nor can it be mitigated
on the theory that contacts with foreign citizens are only casual (MC 3) since he is now married to
a foreign citizen. There is a rebuttable presumption that Applicant has ties to and affection for his
wife and in-laws and nothing has been submitted to rebut that presumption. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Such security concerns could be mitigated by a determination "that the immediate family
members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the
United States." Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3 No evidence has been offered to justify the application of a
mitigating condition. </SPAN></P>
