<P>Although the Applicant's past criminal conduct is not recent, he has failed to offer any documentation that demonstrates he has addressed his state tax lien, 
which is in excess of $18,000.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 26, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on April 3, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on August 18, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on or about August 27, 2002, and Applicant's Reply was received on September 30, 2002.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on November 5, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past criminal conduct and present financial 
difficulties militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 46 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  From 1982 to 1987, the Applicant wilfully failed to file his state income tax returns (Government Exhibit (GX) 11).  These wilful failures to file are in 
violation of that states revenue and tax code; and as such, were misdemeanors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  In January of 1998, the Applicant was arrested for Perjury (GX 6 at page 4).  He was fined $150, and prosecution was deferred for one year (GX 8).  In 
July of 2000, the case against him was dismissed (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.  The Applicant is indebted to his former state's franchise tax board in an amount in excess of $18,000 (GX 10 at page 5).  The Applicant denies this 
allegation, but offers no documentation in support of his averment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation save his bare averments (GX 3 and Reply).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) which establishes doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability 
to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's past criminal conduct, by not filing his state income tax returns in the mid 1980s, he was subject to possible prosecution for 
six separate misdemeanor violations.  More than four years ago, he was also arrested for Perjury, but prosecution was deferred and the case against him 
dismissed in July of 2000.  I find that the Applicant's past criminal conduct is not recent enough in time so as to be of present security significance.  Guideline J 
is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same can not be said as to his financial situation, however.  The Applicant has an outstanding state tax lien in excess of $18,000 (GX 10 at page 5), and he 
has offered no documentation that he has addressed it.  In his answer to the SOR, he blames the state for not applying his "entitled W-2 withholding credits" 
towards his past due indebtedness.  This not acceptable, it is the Applicant's responsibility to address his past due indebtedness, not the state of his former 
residence.  This shows extremely poor judgement on Applicant's part; and as such, Guideline F is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
