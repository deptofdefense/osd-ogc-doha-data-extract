<P>Applicant owed four debts totaling approximately $12,000.  He has paid three of the debts and is making monthly payments on the remaining debt. The record 
evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from Applicant's finances. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-20459.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On February 
6, 2004, Applicant's answer to the SOR and request for a hearing was received. On September 1, 2004, I was assigned the case. On September 1, 2004, a 
Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on September 22, 2004. The transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received on September 30, 
2004. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which were received on October 13, 2005.  Department Counsel having no 
objection, the documents were admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Financial Considerations. The Applicant admits owing four debts and being declined a debt consolidation loan. Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the whole record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 36 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since June 1999, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance.  The SOR alleges 
Applicant owed four debts totaling approximately $ 12,000. A summary of those debts follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2003, Applicant applied for a debt consolidation loan, but was turned down due to past delinquencies, garnishment, and current credit obligations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, Applicant's finances became worse when he was overseas in an unaccompanied status.  His wife was handling their finances, but did a poor job.  
Applicant acknowledges he should have taken care of their finances. Also, in 1998, Applicant retired from the Army. Following retirement, the only job he 
could get paid minimum wages. His wife was unable to work due to medical problems.  He has now paid three of the debts he accrued as a result of his income 
reduction and is making monthly payments on the remaining debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, (Financial Considerations). A person's relationship with his creditors is a private 
matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating 
or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding 
of a security clearance. Under Guideline F, an Applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial 
obligations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant owed four debts totaling approximately $12,000. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1. (E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations.) 
and DC 3. (E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has paid three of the debts (SOR paragraphs 2b, 2.c, and 2.d) and is making $125 monthly payments on the remaining debt (SOR paragraph 1.a), 
which now has a balance of $3,754.09.  Mitigating Conditions (MC) 6. (E2.A6.1.3.6.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2003, Applicant was denied a consolidation loan due to the status of his finances at that time. Despite this set back, he has been able to make 
significant progress in satisfying his debts. I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
