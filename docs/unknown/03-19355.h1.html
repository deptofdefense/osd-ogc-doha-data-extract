<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 23 November 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-19355.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 8 December 2004, but declined a hearing. On 9 December 2004, Applicant submitted a 
letter requesting a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 9 February 2005. On 15 March 2005, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on 24 March 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old senior designer for a defense contractor. At her place of employment, Applicant is known as an honest, dedicated, and hard-working 
employee. </P> 
<P>From 1996-98, Applicant sought and received mental health counseling. She saw a mental health counselor (a psychologist) while she was enrolled at 
university. She also sought mental health counseling while she was at home, away from her university. She sought counseling because she was depressed about 
her future and getting a job. One of the doctors she saw prescribed Prozac. Although it was prescribed for daily use, she only took it once every other day. After 
three months, she stopped using the drug because it made her worry. Because of a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, Applicant sought 
treatment from a physician. The doctor referred Applicant to her husband, who is a psychiatrist. She saw him two or three times. He diagnosed her as having 
mild clinical depression and gave her a prescription for Celexa. She returned to the psychiatrist once more but has not felt the need to seek counseling since.</P> 
<P>Applicant used numerous illegal substances. Once during high school, she huffed computer cleaner to get high. In 1995 or 1996, she put hallucinogenic 
mushrooms on a pizza and ate it.  In 1999, she bought mushrooms from a shop in Amsterdam and ate them. She tried ecstasy a few times while in high school, 
but did not like the effect it had on her. Nevertheless, she used it several times while in college. She bought the ecstasy one pill at a time from a friend.</P> 
<P>Applicant used crystal methamphetamine less than 15 times by snorting it up her nose and by injecting herself with a needle.  She gave friends money to buy the 
methamphetamine for her. She bought cocaine approximately five times, but used it on as many as 25 occasions. She used marijuana less than 20 times.  </P> 
<P>Applicant was prescribed Percocet when she had her wisdom teeth pulled in 1997 or 1998. She used the drug until the prescription ran out, well past the time 
the pain from the surgery had dissipated.</P> 
<P>Applicant asserts that she has not used any drugs illegally since 1998.</P> 
<P>On 31 January 2001, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it, she certified that the form was "true, complete, and correct" to the best 
of her knowledge and belief and acknowledged that a "knowing and willful false statement" therein could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Question 27 
asked if, in the previous seven years, she had "illegally used any controlled substance" or prescription drugs. Question 19 asked if, in the previous seven years, 
she had consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or another health care provided about a mental health related 
condition. Applicant answered "no" to both questions.  Ex. 1 at 8, 6.</P> 
<P>In May 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent and completed a signed, sworn statement. In it, she admitted her mental 
health counseling and her considerable drug use. She claimed she failed to list the mental health treatment because she "did not see anyone on a regular basis 
and because it was not a severe diagnosis [she] did not think it was relevant even though a question asked for it on the security form." Ex. 2 at 4.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on her SCA by deliberately failing to disclose her illegal use of drugs in the previous seven years 
(&para; 1.a) and failing to disclose she had received treatment for a mental health-related condition (&para;1.b).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Applicant admitted both allegations. Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish  potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E. Applicant deliberately failed to 
disclose on her SCA that she had an extensive history of drug abuse and several visits to mental health counselors. An applicant's drug use and history of 
mental health counseling are relevant and material to a determination of an applicant's security worthiness. Applicant deliberately omitted relevant and material 
facts from her SCA. DC E2.A5.1.2.2. As late as May 2003, when she was interviewed by the DSS agent, she was unable to accept complete responsibility for 
her actions. Instead, she rationalized her omission concerning mental health treatment by claiming she did not think her treatment was relevant because it was 
neither regular nor severe.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, at the hearing Applicant freely admitted her omissions, took  full responsibility for her actions, showed great remorse, and pledged she had 
become a different person. I found her confession, statement of remorse, and vow that her life has changed to be credible. By admitting her omissions she took 
positive steps to significantly eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. MC E2.A5.1.3.5. None of the other listed mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of the person's past conduct and 
present circumstances. It includes an evaluation of the whole person using the adjudicative factors in the Directive &para; E2.2.1. There is no doubt Applicant's 
deliberate omissions from her SCA represent serious, deliberate misconduct. Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1, E2.2.1.2. But the conduct was isolated and occurred a 
number of years ago. Directive &para; E2.2.1.3. Although she was 25 years old when she completed her SCA, it is clear she has matured significantly since then. 
Directive &para; E2.2.1.4. There is no potential for exploitation based on her conduct. Directive &para; E2.2.1.8. I conclude the likelihood of recurrence is remote. 
Directive &para; E2.2.1.9. Under the circumstances, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by deliberately failing to report her drug use and mental health care related treatment on her 
SCA. &para; 2.a. Applicant admitted this allegation. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive 
branch of the Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant knowingly and willfully made materially false statements in her SCA. 
An applicant may be disqualified from holding a security clearance by committing a serious criminal offense, such as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. DC 
E2.A10.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal behavior was not recent. Her last offense occurred when she falsified her SCA, over four years ago. The criminal offense was not an 
isolated incident. <EM>See</EM> MC E2.A10.1.3.2. After applying the adjudicative process factors listed in Directive &para; E2.2.1 and discussed above, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
