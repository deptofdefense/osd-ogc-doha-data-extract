<P>Applicant, a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor did sustain  financial reversals due to poor health, retirement from the U. S. Navy, a period of 
unemployment, adoption of his wife's granddaughter, and his subsequent separation.  However, his financial statements indicated an ability to repay old debts, 
maintain current expenses, with a surplus each month.  The record contains no evidence that bills were paid even though he made assurances that they were 
being paid.  He gave false answers on two successive security clearance questionnaires.  He has not mitigated security concerns over his finances and personal

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On November 23, 2004,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged 
facts under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) which detail reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated December 13, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant 
material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was received by Applicant on January 27, 2005.  Applicant was 
afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by February 26, 2005.  Applicant declined to submit a 
response to the FORM.  The case was  assigned to me on March 17, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted to two of six of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.), and denied the 
two allegations of Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a. and b.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review 
of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, who is separated from his wife,<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> is a  42-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He was employed by this 
contractor in 2001<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, and he obtained a security clearance while in the U. S. Navy in 1987.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He has a history of unpaid debts going back to 1997.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The following 
chart sets forth each unpaid debt alleged in the SOR, the type, amount and the current status.</SPAN></P>

<P>Applicant disputes the debts in subparagraph 1.b., d., and f.  But these debts appear on his credit reports.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  All are unpaid except 1.f. which Applicant claims he 
has paid, and that there is documentation to prove he paid it.  Although he provided no documentation, this debt does not appear on the last credit report of 
April 27, 2004.  It could have been paid or it could have dropped off the report due to the age of the debt.  The debt in 1.b. is disputed as Applicant denies 
having ever attended this trade school, but he supplied no proof, and it appears on all credit reports.  He wrote letters to the creditor in April 2004 requesting the 
debts be removed form his credit report, but he had until the end of February 2005 to respond to the FORM and supply responses from his creditors or other 
mitigating evidence but failed to respond.  He denied the debt in 1.d but again has not provided any rebuttal evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Some of Applicant's financial difficulties can be traced to a series of adverse events in his life.  He suffered a heart attack; he retired from the U. S. Navy; he 
was unemployed for several months upon separation from the service; then his wife was laid off from her job; he then had to bring a 14-year-old, pregnant, 
step-daughter to his home to provide care until the child was born; he and his wife subsequently adopted the grandchild; and finally, his wife quit working so 
she could provide care and nurturing for their adopted child.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Then he and his wife separated.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN>  In his statement of July 12, 2002, Applicant gave assurances 
that these debts would be paid or that arrangements for payment would be forthcoming.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  His financial statements indicate an ability to repay old debts, 
maintain current expenses, with a surplus each month.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant has not submitted any evidence that this has occurred.  </P> 
<P>In answer to Standard Form 86, <STRONG><EM>Question 38.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days</EM></STRONG><EM>.  In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on 
any debts?</EM>, his answer was "No".  In answer to <STRONG><EM>Question 39.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days</EM></STRONG><EM>.  In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 90 days 
delinquent on any debts?</EM>, his answer was "No". <A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He denied that these answers were false but his credit reports show that some of these debts have been 
outstanding for years, and some were written off as bad debts but he never paid them.  Again, when given the opportunity to mitigate or explain, he was silent. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="04-03074.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline F (financial considerations) (FC), Directive,&para; E2.A6.1.1. <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts; </EM>and Guideline E 
(personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F.  As indicated above, Applicant's financial situation deteriorated beginning in 1997.  
Notwithstanding a series of adverse events in his life, his financial statements indicate an ability to pay his debts.  But the debts listed in the SOR continue to 
show up on successive credit reports as unpaid.  He indicated he would make payments or that he had suffered identity theft but when given an opportunity to 
respond to the FORM and provide answers, he failed to submit any mitigating evidence.  Though his answers and statements indicate an intent to pay debts, 
Applicant has not provided any documentation that he has paid his creditors.  Failure to pay outstanding financial obligations gives rise to Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that he had health problems, retired from the service, and experienced marital discord might be argued were situations largely beyond his control.  This 
could bring his case within the Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>).  But the 
financial statements indicated an ability to pay debts with a surplus on hand, and Applicant has not made a good-faith effort to pay down his debts.  His actions 
do not rise to the level necessary to satisfy  FC MC E2A6.1.3.6. (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts</EM>). Given the surplus shown on his financial statements, Applicant had the ability to pay something toward his arrearage.  The fact that these larger debts 
show no progress toward payment, combined with the fact that he did not submit any response to the FORM, cannot be characterized as a "good-faith effort."  I 
conclude SOR allegations 1.a. through f. against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  two questions on his security clearance application on two different submissions in 2000 and 
2002, by omitting that he had periods of delinquent debts greater than 90 and 180 days, respectively.  The credit reports and his admissions demonstrate that he 
had debts in excess of these time periods.  These false statements come under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM> 
(the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant offered no rebuttal.  No mitigating conditions are applicable.  I conclude SOR allegation 2.a. 
and b. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
