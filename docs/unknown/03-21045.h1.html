<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 7, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H (drug involvement), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline E (personal 
conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February 4, 2006</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted the 
allegations under SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 2.a - 2.f, 3.b - 3.f, and denied with explanations &para;&para; 3.a, and 4.a - 4.c. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2006, and 
the date of the hearing was delayed due to Applicant's attorney's availability. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on April 13, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">May 
3, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted nine exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-9. The exhibits 
were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and had four witnesses testify on his behalf. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on May 19, 2006.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel moved to amend SOR &para; 4.b by deleting the words "2.a." Applicant did not object and the motion was granted. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 52 years old, married for the third time, college educated, and has worked as a research engineer for a federal contractor since 1999. He held a 
secret security clearance from approximately 2000 until 2003, when it was revoked due to issues related to his hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 18, 2003, Applicant used marijuana, while under the influence of alcohol.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant held a secret security clearance at the time. Applicant was 
celebrating his 50<SUP>th</SUP> birthday and college students who were his friends attended a party at his house and provided the marijuana to him. He stated I was "just 
going along with the crowd."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He later went to a bar to continue the celebration. He admits he was intoxicated. Coworkers were also present at the party, but did 
not participate in the drug use. On July 23, 2005, he was directed to submit to a random drug test by his employer and tested positive for marijuana. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested twice for drug involvement in the past. In 1979, he was arrested and charged with possession of hashish, a felony. He and his brother 
were taking a trip and his brother brought hashish. They were stopped by the police for speeding and the drugs were found.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant claimed he only used 
marijuana, as his drug of choice, but because the drugs were in the car he too was charged.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He pled guilty and was awarded probation. If he successfully 
completed the probation the charge would be dismissed. He did and the charge was subsequently set aside. He was advised by his then attorney, that </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"the verdict of guilty has been set aside, and the accusation (indictment) has been dismissed, thereby releasing you from all penalties and disabilities resulting 
from the offense of which you were convicted. However, proof of this conviction my be made known to the Court should you again be convicted of any 
criminal offense."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant interpreted this statement to mean that he did not have to list it under Question 21 on his security clearance application (SCA) requesting he provide 
information about whether he had ever been charged or convicted of any felony offense, regardless of whether the record had been sealed or otherwise stricken 
from the record, unless the conviction fell under a certain federal exemption, which it did not.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was again arrested in October 1992, and charged with possession of a narcotic controlled substance. His apartment was being inspected by 
exterminators and they found drugs.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The police obtained a search warrant and confirmed the presence of the drugs. Applicant claimed at the hearing that he 
could not recall what kind of drugs he had in his possession.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> When pressed, he admitted that the only drug he used was marijuana and he had been using it 
occasionally during this time period, perhaps every other week to every other month.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He admitted the marijuana was for his use.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He claims he did not use 
drugs after this last drug arrest. He was placed in a pretrial diversion program where he participated in group counseling once a week and was drug tested for 6-12 months. He successfully completed the program. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contradicted himself as to his drug use. Applicant stated at his hearing that he used drugs in college and had abstained from drug use until his 50th 
birthday on July 18, 2003.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He also stated that his last drug use prior to his birthday was 17-20 years before.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> However, he also admitted that the drugs found 
in his apartment in 1992, were his and he had been using them occasionally. In a sworn statement he also stated, "I first started using marijuana when I was in 
college between the 1970s and early 1980's. I smoked marijuana cigarettes at parties or with friends. Occasionally, I purchased marijuana approximately six 
times per year and would pay around twenty dollars for half an ounce from friends."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He went on to say from the early 1980's until my fiftieth birthday, on 18 
Jul 03, I did not use marijuana at all."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Applicant's testimony and sworn statements are contradictory. He denies using drugs from his college years until his 
50<SUP>th</SUP> birthday, but was arrested in 1992 for possession and admits he used drugs during this period. His testimony was not credible. He attributes his drug use on 
his 50th birthday due to his intoxication and poor judgment.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not list his 1992 arrest on his SF 86 in answering Question 24 which asks if the applicant has ever been charged or convicted of any offense 
related to alcohol or drugs. The question specifically tells the applicant to list all charges regardless of whether the case has been sealed or otherwise stricken 
from the record. Applicant claimed he did not list the charge because he believed that in accordance with the state statute where he was arrested the arrest under 
the pretrial diversion program "shall be deemed to have never occurred."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement made on May 4, 2001, when commenting on his three DUI arrests, Applicant went on to say "[o]ther than the above, I have not been 
arrested at any time, for any reason."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant claims he thought because he had been in a diversion program that he did not have to list his prior arrests. I 
find Applicant was not credible. I find based on Applicant's other inconsistencies that the affirmative statement made under oath was meant to mislead the 
investigator. It was not just a matter of not listing his arrest, but the bold statement that he had not been arrested at any time for any reason is a deliberate 
attempt to mislead.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The question clearly advised Applicant that there was only one exception and he did not qualify for it. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested three times for driving under the influence of alcohol. In March1994, he was arrested and sentenced to alcohol treatment group sessions 
and fined. His license was also suspended, but he continued to drive anyway. He was aware he was breaking the law. In September 1994, he was arrested and 
charged with DUI, having a blood alcohol content over .08% or more, and a traffic offense. He was again sentenced to alcohol group counseling, fined, and 
placed on house arrest with an ankle monitor. In 1996, he was charged with DUI, blood alcohol of .08% or more, and driving on a suspended license. He pled 
guilty to the first two offenses and was sentenced to 365 days in jail which was stayed pending the completion of an alcohol program and five years summary 
probation. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $1,568, report to alcohol counseling, and his driver's license was revoked for three years. From 1994 to 1996, 
Applicant admitted he drank every day, frequented bars and would consume various amounts of alcohol.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He also admitted that he would drive after he had 
been drinking during this period of time and did not get caught.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> He also continued to drive after his license was suspended.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement made on April 28, 2004 Applicant stated: "I quit consuming alcohol from approximately 1998 to 1999. Since then I only drink socially 
and might consume beer six to twelve times per year and drink from one to six beers per occasion."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> He claimed he stopped drinking for awhile, but started 
again because of peer pressure.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> He went on to state "I do not feel I have an alcohol problem."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After abstaining from alcohol for a period of time Applicant started consuming small amounts and then he gradually started to increase the amount and 
frequency.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> In his answer to interrogatories he provided on September 27, 2005, he stated he drank daily and consumed 3-4 beers in two hours and 3-6 shots of 
tequila.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> At his hearing he stated he would drink 3-4 beers and 3-5 shots 4 to 6 days a week. Applicant's testimony and sworn statements are inconsistent and 
attempt to minimize how much and how often he was drinking.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has attended different alcohol counseling programs from August 31, 1994 to March 29, 1996, May 29, 1996 to March 27, 1998, and February 18, 
1997 to September 10, 1999. All of Applicant's alcohol counseling was court ordered. On September 2003, he received an alcohol assessment due to his drug 
use on July 18, 2003, and a diagnosis was not provided.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Applicant provided the information to the interviewer and minimized his alcohol use claiming he had 
only used alcohol twice in the past thirty days, which is inconsistent with his testimony and other sworn statements.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> He also provided information that he had 
not used marijuana for the past twenty years, which was also inconsistent with him being arrested in 1992 for drug possession and his admitted use of marijuana 
during that period. Also in his sworn statement of April 28, 2004, he stated "From the early 1980's until my fiftieth birthday, on 18 Jul 03, I did not use 
marijuana at all."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> This statement is inconsistent with his hearing testimony and the fact he had been arrested in 1992 and admitted to using marijuana during 
that period of his life. He also admitted at the hearing that his statement on April 28<SUP>th</SUP> was false.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> He admitted he did not think anyone would find out about his 
prior drug use.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed to the interviewer that he had not been charged with any crimes during his life, which was obviously false. He admitted lying because he 
wanted a good evaluation.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> At the time, he strongly believed he did not have a problem with drugs or alcohol. Much of the information provided by Applicant 
to the interviewer used for making the assessment was not true and minimized Applicant's use of alcohol, drugs, and criminal conduct relating thereto.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> 
Applicant admitted at his hearing that he "probably did not tell the whole truth"<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> to the interviewer. The results of the assessment are obviously factually based 
and without honest and truthful answers they are not given any weight. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to this hearing, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol program that started two days after his hearing. He stated "I've enrolled in a treatment program here as of 
last week to curb that problem."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> This is the first program he has voluntarily attended. He has not consumed alcohol since April 23, 2006. He admits he has 
known since the mid-1990s that he is an alcoholic and his present motivation for attending alcohol counseling is to keep his job and regain his security 
clearance. He admits he has made bad decisions when he drank. He does not intend to use drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor testified he is punctual, a good communicator and worker. He has had contact with him for the past 5-6 years and believes he is 
trustworthy and takes his job and attitude toward national security very seriously. A coworker and a partner in a business with Applicant testified he believes 
him to be trustworthy and has not shown signs of poor judgment. Applicant had told him several times that he intended to cut down on his drinking. Two other 
witnesses testified that they believe Applicant to be trustworthy. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H-Drug Involvement is a security concern because improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness 
or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption-a security risk may exist because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines H, G, J and E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM><A HREF="03-21045.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A>)<EM>, </EM>applies.<EM> </EM>Applicant used marijuana while 
holding a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>The drug involvement was 
not recent); </EM>DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (<EM>The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>), and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse 
any drugs in the future</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Applicant has a past history of using drugs that remained dormant for a period of time until in 2003 he used marijuana to celebrate his 
50<SUP>th</SUP> birthday. DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1 does not apply. DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 does not apply because although his latest drug use occurred after a considerable period 
of dormancy, he resurrected it while drinking alcohol and while celebrating. He had a history of drug use and therefore his most recent use was neither isolated 
nor an aberrational event. Although Applicant claims he will not use drugs in the future, his past conduct shows that when drinking alcohol and the opportunity 
arose for him to use drugs again, he did so. Without having some idea of why he would use drugs again at this stage of his life, it is too uncertain to believe that 
he will not do so again in the future. Applicant attempted to minimize and hide his past involvement with drugs, which is also a grave concern. Applicant failed 
to mitigate the drug involvement concern under Guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, I considered all the disqualifying conditions and especially considered Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC)

<EM>(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged)</EM>, and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses</EM>)<EM> </EM>and conclude they apply. Applicant has three DUI charges/convictions and two charges for drug possession, one of which was a felony. 
The felony was dismissed after completing probation and the other possession charge was handled through a pretrial diversion program. He also drove on a 
suspended licence and was convicted of that charge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.1 (<EM>The alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>)<EM>, </EM>AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>)<EM>, 
</EM>and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 (<EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>)<EM>.</EM> I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant's problems with 
alcohol have carried over to criminal charges, most of which are alcohol or drug related and clearly indicate a pattern. When Applicant drinks alcohol he makes 
poor decisions, such as driving and using drugs, especially while holding a security clearance. He attempted to minimize how much he drank and, when he was 
given an evaluation in anticipation of his hearing, he was not truthful to the evaluator, in both his past consumption and his legal background, thereby raising 
concerns of his willingness to hide his background, his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. Applicant has been through numerous alcohol treatment 
programs that have done little to curb his alcohol abuse. Although apparently in the past he recognized he probably is an alcoholic, it was not until days before 
his hearing that he voluntarily signed up for a program. But he had not yet attended any counseling. There is a clear pattern of alcohol related incidents and AC 
C E2.A7.1.3.1 does not apply. There is clear evidence the problem still exists as the Applicant has only been sober for less than two weeks. AC MC 
E2.A7.1.3.2 does not apply. Without a significant track record of sobriety and positive changes in Applicant's life towards sobriety AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 can not 
be applied. I find at this time there is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant is not a security risk due to his past behavior and there is a lack of record to 
support a meaningful period of sobriety or changes in Applicant's behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to Applicant's criminal activity I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 
(CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>)<EM>, </EM>CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>)<EM>,</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3. <EM>(The person 
was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life</EM>)<EM>,</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 <EM>(The person did not 
voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>)<EM>, </EM>and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation</EM>)<EM>,</EM> and conclude none apply. Applicant's illegal use of drugs occurred in 2003, and although he was not arrested or charged it is still a criminal 
offense. He has a past history of drug and alcohol charges. Therefore, I find the criminal activity was recent and not isolated.. In addition, Applicant has three 
past DUI arrests and two drug charges that also support his criminal activity was not a mere aberration. There is no evidence he was pressured or coerced into 
committing any of the criminal acts. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 do not apply. There is no evidence the criminal 
acts were not voluntary. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 does not apply. There is no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. His recent enrollment in a treatment 
program is not proof sufficient to verify his commitment to sobriety. Without that part of his life being under control, a finding can not be made that violations 
are not likely to recur or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. I find that CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Many of Applicant's criminal offenses were related to his alcohol and drug abuse. I find because of his long history of abusing alcohol, his recent drug use, and 
past drug history, his attempt to minimize his alcohol abuse, his lack of commitment to resolving his alcohol problems in the past, and his very recent 
enrollment in a alcohol program, that he failed to mitigate the security concern raised about his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct, under Guidelines G 
and J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>), PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.3 (<EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination</EM>),<EM> </EM>and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal 
Conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if 
known, may affect the person's personal , professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>)<EM> </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attempted to minimize and mislead investigators about his past conduct, to include how much alcohol he consumes, his frequency of drug use and his 
criminal record. Although he points to factors for why he failed to provide the requested information, such as he believed he did not have to divulge the 
information because he was in a pretrial diversion program or the charge was dismissed, I find when considering all of his testimony and sworn statements that 
he intentionally meant to mislead investigators. Applicant is an educated person and was fully aware of his criminal past and the only exceptions to not 
providing the information. His other statements support his effort to mislead and falsify, especially when he claimed he was never charged with any crimes 
during his life. Surely, he could not have been confused about his three DUI arrests and two drug arrest, one of which was a felony. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, Applicant used drugs  with college students and where coworkers had assembled, while he held a security clearance. This type of conduct makes 
Applicant especially vulnerable to exploitation </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was 
an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>), PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt , good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>)<EM>, </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.4 (<EM>Omission of material facts was caused or 
significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully 
provided), </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress</EM>)<EM>. </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has consistently lied about his drug and alcohol abuse and problems. Applicant 
deliberately misled and provided false information to defense investigators on more than one occasion. Because of his attempts to minimized his drug, alcohol, 
and criminal conduct when providing sworn statements, I find he was not credible in his claims he believed he did not have to list his offenses under Questions 
21 and 24. These were not isolated incidents and Applicant did not provide the correct information voluntarily. Applicant's testimony raised serious credibility 
concerns. Using drugs while holding a clearance is a serious violation. Until Applicant resolves his alcohol problem the personal conduct concerns remain. 
Based on the reasons provided above under Guidelines H, G and J, and the other analyses, I find Applicant failed to mitigated the personal conduct security 
concerns under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person, his testimony, demeanor and credibility, in addition to his past work performance and exemplary comments from witness. After 
considering all of the evidence, I am persuaded by its totality, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Accordingly, Guidelines H, G, J and E are decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
