<P>Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued a decision, dated October 22, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  The
Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing consistent with the rulings and instructions set
forth in this Decision and Remand Order.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated
January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by rendering an adverse
decision despite the fact that a military service Central Adjudication Facility cleared Applicant in May 1998; (2) whether
the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole person concept; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by
considering Applicant's extramarital affair under the Personal Conduct Adjudicative Guidelines instead of the Sexual
Behavior Adjudicative Guidelines.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 30, 1998. 
The SOR was based on Criterion E (Personal Conduct).  A hearing was held on September 24, 1998.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's
appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P>1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by rendering an adverse decision despite the fact that a military service Central
Adjudication Facility cleared Applicant in May 1998</U>.  During the hearing, Applicant proffered a May 19, 1998 letter from
a military service Central Adjudication Facility (CAF).  That letter (Applicant Exhibit B) informed Applicant she was
being granted a security clearance because the CAF had determined that she had provided information that "sufficiently
explained, mitigated, or provided extenuating circumstances regarding the disqualifying information [about her]. 
Accordingly, you have been granted a . . . security clearance and determined eligible for assignment to a sensitive
position."  During the hearing, Applicant's counsel referred to the favorable clearance decision made by the CAF
concerning Applicant, and argued that the favorable CAF decision should result in a favorable decision in this case
(Hearing Transcript at pp. 16-18).  Department Counsel argued that the favorable CAF decision was "a separate situation"
and "shouldn't apply as a precedent here." (Hearing Transcript at pp. 92-93).  The Administrative Judge acknowledged the
CAF's favorable decision, but noted Applicant did not submit any evidence about the information underlying the CAF's
favorable decision (Decision at p. 4).  Apart from a general reference to the documents presented by Applicant (Decision
at p. 7), the Judge did not specifically discuss or state what weight or significance he gave to the CAF's favorable
decision.</P>

<P>On appeal, Applicant contends it would be "absurd and inconsistent" that the Administrative Judge could make an adverse
clearance decision in her case when she was cleared by the CAF.  Department Counsel responds that Applicant's
contention is based on a theory of estoppel or <EM>res judicata</EM>, and that she is not entitled to a security clearance based on
either theory.  These arguments raise the issue of whether the Judge erred by rendering an adverse decision despite the
fact that Applicant received a favorable security clearance decision from the CAF in May 1998.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional
Procedural Guidance, Item 32 ("The Appeal Board shall address the material issues raised by the parties. . . .").</P>

<P> When there is no express provision of law (<EM>e.g.</EM>, federal statute, Executive Order, regulation, or directive) that covers an
issue in a case, then general principles of law (such as collateral estoppel, equitable estoppel and <EM>res judicata</EM>) may be
applied, as appropriate, to make a ruling or decide a case.  However, such general legal principles do not apply when there
is a provision of law that specifically covers an issue in a case.  For the reasons that follow, the general legal principles of
collateral estoppel, equitable estoppel and <EM>res judicata</EM> do not apply to this case.</P>

<P>Executive Order 12829 ("National Industrial Security Program") was promulgated on January 8, 1993.  Pursuant to that
Executive Order, the Secretary of Defense promulgated the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual
(NISPOM).<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>
<P>  A review of Executive Order 12829 and the NISPOM shows that they apply to contractor employees, such
as Applicant.</P>

<P>Of particular note in this case, Section 2-203 of the NISPOM reads as follows:</P>

<P>"Federal agencies that grant security clearances (TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, Q or L) to their employees
or their contractor employees are responsible for determining whether such employees have been previously cleared or
investigated by the Federal Government.  Any previously granted PCL<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
<P> that is based upon a current investigation of a
scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance required, shall provide the basis for issuance of a new
clearance without further investigation or adjudication unless significant derogatory information that was not previously
adjudicated becomes known to the granting agency."</P>

<P>Nothing in the language of Section 2-203 indicates or suggests that it is a discretionary provision.  To the contrary, the
language of Section 2-203 clearly indicates it is mandatory in nature.  Accordingly, the Board rejects Department
Counsel's contention that the Judge has the discretion to decide what weight, if any, should be given to the prior favorable
CAF adjudication of Applicant's security eligibility.</P>

<P>The question remains whether Section 2-203 applies to adjudications by DOHA.  It is a principle of statutory construction
(applicable by analogy to Executive Orders and agency regulations)<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> that different statutes should be construed in a
manner that gives full force and effect to each whenever practical.  <EM>See, e.g., Vimar Seguros Y Reasegurs v. M/V Sky
Reefer</EM>, 515 U.S. 528, 533 (1995)(when two statutes are capable of coexistence, court should regard each as effective in
the absence of express congressional intention to the contrary); <EM>United States ex rel. Sutton v. Double Day Office Services</EM>,
121 F.3d 531, 535 (9th Cir. 1997)(unless there is a "positive repugnancy" between two laws, court must give effect to
both laws); <EM>In re Colonial Realty Co.</EM>, 980 F.2d 125, 132 (2d Cir. 1992)("[I]n addressing arguably inconsistent
requirements of two statutes, the courts must give effect to both where possible.").  Apart from this principle of statutory
construction, Section 203(b) of Executive Order 12829 directs that "[a]gency implementing regulations, internal rules, or
guidelines shall be consistent with this order, its implementing directives, and the Manual."  Accordingly, the language of
Section 2-203 of the NISPOM should not be construed to nullify Executive Order 10865 or the Directive, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.</P>

<P>Nothing in Executive Order 12829 or the NISPOM exempts adjudications under Executive Order 10865.  Furthermore,
since the NISPOM applies to contractor employees (Sections 1-100, 1-102), there is no basis in the record below to
conclude that Applicant's case does not fall, as a matter of law, within the scope of Section 2-203 of the NISPOM.  In
addition, because Section 2-203 of the NISPOM directs that reciprocity be given to favorable security clearance decisions
but not to unfavorable ones, application of Section 2-203 in DOHA proceedings in appropriate cases would not be in
derogation of an applicant's right to a hearing under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>
<P>The Board's conclusions about Section 2-203 of the NISPOM require it to modify its holdings in several prior Board
decisions that addressed the significance of a prior security clearance decision.  There are two categories of Board
decisions that need to be addressed: (a) Board decisions issued prior to implementation of the NISPOM; and (b) Board
decisions issued after implementation of the NISPOM.  In those Board decisions issued before the NISPOM,<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>
<P> the Board's
resolution of the matter was based on discussion of general legal principles.  While application of those general legal
principles was appropriate prior to implementation of the NISPOM, the reasoning of those Board decisions is superseded
to the extent that the Section 2-203 of the NISPOM (or any other similar provision of applicable federal law) is applicable
and takes precedence over general legal principles.  In those Board decisions issued after implementation of the
NISPOM,<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> the Board erred to the extent it did not address the applicability of the NISPOM.  However, a review of the
pertinent Board decisions issued after implementation of the NISPOM shows the result in five of those cases would be the
same because they involved applicants who engaged in misconduct after they had received favorable security clearance
decisions.  The applicants' new misconduct in those cases constituted "significant derogatory information that was not
previously adjudicated" within the meaning of Section 2-203 of the NISPOM.  In the sixth Board decision (ISCR Case
No. 96-0461), the reasoning of today's decision might have had a dispositive impact.  However, there is not sufficient
information available<A HREF="98-0320.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> in the sixth case to determine whether there actually was a prior security clearance adjudication on
the applicant's pertinent conduct.</P>

<P>The Board's holdings in any other cases concerning the application of the general principles of collateral estoppel,
equitable estoppel, and <EM>res judicata</EM> are affected by this decision only to the extent that Section 2-203 of the NISPOM (or
any other similar provision of federal law) is applicable to a given applicant's case.  Whenever Section 2-203 of the
NISPOM (or any other similar provision of federal law) is not applicable, the general principles of collateral estoppel,
equitable estoppel, and <EM>res judicata</EM> should be applied as appropriate.</P>

<P>The record below is insufficient to enable the Board to conclude, as a matter of law, that Applicant was entitled to a
favorable security clearance decision by virtue of Section 2-203 of the NISPOM.  However, Applicant has effectively
raised the issue of whether DOHA processed her case consistent with applicable regulations, including the NISPOM. 
Pursuant to Item 33.b. of the Additional Procedural Guidance, the case is remanded to the Administrative Judge with
instructions to allow the parties to develop the record concerning the applicability of Section 2-203 to Applicant's case. 
Given the mandatory language of Section 2-203, Department Counsel must take all reasonable steps to procure and
provide information relevant to the applicability of Section 2-203, including information that will clarify questions such as
whether the SOR was issued on the basis of "significant derogatory information that was not previously adjudicated."</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole person concept</U> / 3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred
by considering Applicant's extramarital affair under the Personal Conduct Adjudicative Guidelines instead of the Sexual
Behavior Adjudicative Guidelines</U>.  For the reasons stated in resolution of the first appeal issue, the Board is remanding
the case for further proceedings and issuance of a new decision.  Issuance of a new decision might render these two appeal
issues moot.  Therefore, it would be premature for the Board to address these issues at this time.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>For the reasons stated in this decision, the Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing
pursuant to Items 35 and 25 of the Directive's Additional Procedural Guidance, in accordance with the Board's rulings and
instructions.  If the Judge determines the conduct alleged in the SOR was covered by the CAF adjudication, then he must
enter a favorable decision based on the reciprocity language of Section 2-203 unless Department Counsel presents
evidence showing an exception to Section 2-203 applies.</P>
