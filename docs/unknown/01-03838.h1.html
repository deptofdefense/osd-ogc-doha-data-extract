<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 19, 
2001, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on financial considerations (guideline F) 
because of unpaid delinquencies totaling approximately $17,400.00 in the aggregate, including $14,487.62 in student loan debt, and on personal conduct 
(guideline E) due to her failure to report her delinquent accounts on a March 1999 security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 7, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, forwarding documentation from a consumer credit counseling service 
indicating she had received counseling from that nonprofit public service organization, but was unable to join a program because her problem was student loan 
debt.  On October 9, 2001, Applicant submitted an amended answer in which she requested a decision without a hearing.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Government submitted its File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 8, 2002, a copy of which was forwarded to Applicant with instructions to submit material in explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation within thirty days of receipt.  Applicant elected not to respond, and on March 7, 2002, the case was assigned to me for a decision based on the 
written record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 42-year-old electrical wirer who has been employed by a defense contractor (company X) most recently since March 1999, having also worked 
there from February 1982 to January 1993. Applicant seeks a security clearance for her duties there.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Married in August 1988, Applicant in 1990 decided to pursue an associate's degree in computer science while continuing to work as an electrical wirer for 
company X.  Applicant financed her studies over the next two years through student loans totaling in excess of $10,000.00.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant made payments on at 
least one of these loans through October 1993.</P> 
 
<P>In the mid-1990s, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties, due in part to her spouse's lack of steady employment and his gambling activities.  She 
terminated their troubled marriage, divorcing her spouse in May 1995.  Following their separation,<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant was the sole financial support for her daughter.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  
Focused on paying living expenses, she made </SPAN>no payments on any of her student loans after October 1993, and the accounts fell into default.  In November 
1994, Applicant issued an insufficient funds check in the amount of $14.47 to a pizza restaurant.  In January 1995, Applicant obtained a cash advance of about 
$1,000.00 from her income tax preparer based on her expected income tax refund.  In February 1995, her income tax refund of $225.10 was intercepted by the 
Government in partial repayment of one of her student loans, leaving her without the funds she had counted on to repay the $1,000.00 cash advance.</P> 
 
<P>After a couple of months of unemployment, Applicant in May 1995 secured a position as an A/R supervisor.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  While employed in this capacity to February 
1999, Applicant made no effort to address her student loan delinquency, although her income tax refunds for 1996, 1997 and 1998 were intercepted in partial 
repayment of one of the two student loans held by the U.S. Department of Education.  She also did not pay the $22.00 balance owed a radiologist for medical 
services rendered to her in June 1995.  In late April 1996, Applicant was charged with worthless check for issuing the bad check to the pizza place back in 
November 1994.  Unaware she had been charged, the summons remained outstanding as of June 1999.  In September 1996, a local hospital dental clinic 
referred a $219.00 past due balance for collection.</P> 
 
<P>In March 1999, Applicant returned to work as an electrical wirer for company X.  In conjunction with her employer's request that Applicant be granted a 
security clearance for her duties, Applicant on March 18, 1999, executed a security clearance application (EPSQ) on which she responded negatively to 
question 38. ["In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"] and question 39. ["Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on 
any debt(s)?"]. Aware that her student loan accounts were in default, and that she owed at least $1,000.00 for the cash advance received in January 1995 and 
$219.00 for dental services, Applicant feared that disclosure of her financial delinquencies would hinder her opportunity to be granted a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In Fall 1999, Applicant fell behind on her utility payments due to the higher costs of home heating.  By early 2000, her arrearage balance reached about 
$1,256.13.  In mid-January 2000, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the gas company whereby she promised to pay her monthly charges as 
well as an additional $50.00 each month toward the arrearage with the gas company agreeing to reduce the arrearage balance by the amount equal to her extra 
payment.  In March 2000, Applicant made a $100.00 payment to the gas company toward the arrearage.</P> 
 
<P>During the course of its investigation into Applicant's background for the security clearance, the Defense Security Service (DSS) ran a credit check which 
disclosed outstanding indebtedness of  about $14,445.32 for four separate student loan accounts in default, $228.00 in unpaid dental charges which had been 
placed for collection, $391.74 for cable services rendered sometime before June 1995, $22.00 for radiology services owed since June 1995, $1,014.00 for the 
cash advance extended to her in January 1995, and $1,256.13 in arrearage balance on her account with a utility (gas service) provider.</P> 
 
<P>Sometime prior to mid-April 2000, Applicant was informed by DSS about the adverse financial information listed on her credit record.  Uncertain about some 
of the accounts reported as bad debts, Applicant was given an opportunity to ascertain the status of these accounts.  Applicant contacted the local consumer 
credit counseling service (CCCS) for assistance.  In mid-April 2000, Applicant formally engaged the services of CCCS at an enrollment cost of $35.00 plus a 
monthly service charge of $18.00, authorizing CCCS to obtain a copy of her credit report to be used in assessment of her financial situation.  Applicant signed 
an agreement to cooperate in a debt repayment plan whereby she would pay $339.00 per month to CCCS commencing in May 2000, with CCCS then making 
payments on her delinquent debts.  With this payment, Applicant estimated she would be short each month in the amount of $187.00.</P> 
 
<P>One week after she consulted with CCCS, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent about her adverse credit and failure to list her past due debts on 
her EPSQ.  Applicant provided the DSS agent a copy of her agreement with CCCS, and explained that the $339.00 monthly payments would be disbursed as 
follows:  $199.00 toward the $9,935.78 balance owed on the first and $60.00 toward the $3,012.00 balance owed on the second of two student loan accounts 
held by the United States Department of Education; $20.00 toward the $1,005.54 defaulted balance owed a state student loan foundation; $11.00 toward a 
delinquent student loan of $492.00; $10.00 toward payment of the dental debt in collection, and $21.00 toward the unpaid $1,000.00 cash advance on which she 
believed she owed $1, 014.00.  Applicant attributed the default status on her student loans to irresponsibility, carelessness and bad judgment.  Applicant 
explained that because of her difficulties in handling her personal life in the mid-1990s she did not care about the significance of her financial obligations.  
Applicant disputed a $300.00 plus cable services debt as well as a listed $64.00 debt for pediatric services.  While she claimed no recall of the $22.00 debt for 
radiology services, she expressed her intent to satisfy it within the next month.  Concerning her arrearage to the gas company, Applicant indicated her intent to 
bring the account current by the summer of 2000.  Applicant admitted she deliberately omitted her financial delinquencies from her EPSQ as she was concerned 
she would not have obtained a security clearance if she had disclosed the debts.  During the interview, Applicant executed a personal financial statement on 
which she indicated a net monthly remainder of $197.75 after debt payments totaling $100.00.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not make the promised $339.00 monthly payments to CCCS due to unforeseen car expenses.  Around the time she planned to make the first 
payment, Applicant's car needed repair costing $230.70.  Later that month, she had brake service performed on her automobile costing $387.05.</P> 
 
<P>In June 2000, Applicant was reinterviewed by DSS to explain her failure to make the payments to CCCS.  Applicant indicated she owed $193.55 for the brake 
work and that the battery and alternator were scheduled to be replaced the following week at an estimated additional cost of  $362.00.  Due to recent overtime 
opportunities at work, Applicant related she would be able to satisfy her car repair bills and send CCCS a payment in July 2000.</P> 
 
<P>Before any payment was made by Applicant, the CCCS determined Applicant was not eligible to join a program because her main problem was student loan 
debt rather than unsecured debt.  Applicant continued to make payments to her utility provider, thereby reducing the arrearage to $200.00.  She made no 
payments toward her delinquent student loans, the cash advance debt owed the tax preparer, the radiology debt or the dental services debt.</P> 
 
<P>In response to the SOR, Applicant in September 2001 admitted she had made no payments  on her delinquent accounts with the exception of the utility 
arrearage.  As to whether she deliberately falsified her security clearance application by failing to list her delinquent accounts, Applicant responded, "delinquent 
student loans are not a priority with me.  Rent, light &amp; gas are!"  In October 2001, Applicant filed an amended response to the SOR in which she denied any 
intentional falsification of her security clearance application.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section

Unexplained affluence 
is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">The Concern</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue her security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines F and E:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began to experience financial difficulties in the mid-1990s because of her spouse's lack of steady employment and gambling.  While she was involved 
in this troubled relationship, she focused on providing for herself and her daughter rather than paying on her student loans and other financial accounts.  Her 
student loans fell into default, a dental debt of about $219.00 was placed for collection, she issued a worthless check of $14.47, and a $22.00 balance for 
radiology services went unpaid.  Moreover, with her income tax refund intercepted in partial repayment of her student loan obligations, she did not receive the 
monies she had expected to repay the $1,000.00 advanced to her by her tax preparer.  In 1999, four years after her divorce and months after she had returned to 
work for company X, Applicant fell more than $1,000.00 in arrears in her home heating payments.  Pursuant to an agreement with her utility provider, 
Applicant had reduced the arrearage to $200.00,  but the remaining debts, totaling in the aggregate about $15,766.09,<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> remained unaddressed as of October 
2001.  With the exception of the minor $22.00 balance owed for radiology services and the worthless check charge, Applicant was aware of her delinquent 
accounts when she was interviewed by the DSS agent in April 2000.  Applicant's failure to address known financial obligations warrants consideration of 
disqualifying conditions (DC) E2.A6.1.2. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and E2.A6.1.2.3. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) under 
financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, security significant financial considerations are potentially mitigated if the behavior was not recent (E2.A6.1.3.1.), it was an isolated 
incident (E2.A6.1.3.2.), the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (E2.A6.1.3.3.), the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (E2.A6.1.3.4.), or the individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (E2.A6.1.3.6.).  Whereas Applicant's financial problems in the mid-1990s 
were due at least in part to her spouse's lack of steady employment and/or his gambling, MC E2.A6.1.3.3. applies in mitigation of her failure to make her 
student loan payments during that time.  Yet, her financial difficulties cannot all be attributed to her failed marriage, as evidenced by the substantial arrearage 
owed the utility provider in 1999.  Of paramount concern in this case is Applicant's disregard of her student loan debt and other legitimate financial obligations--such as the $1,014.00 owed her tax preparer for the cash advance taken in 1995--after she had terminated her marriage and secured gainful employment, 
initially as an A/R supervisor and since March 1999 as an electric wirer for her present employer.  Applicant acknowledges having received notices from the 
U.S. Department of Education of her obligation to repay her student loans, but she took no action until April 2000, when following her initial meeting with a 
DSS agent, she contacted a consumer credit counseling organization for assistance.  While Applicant told the DSS she was to begin in May 2000 making 
payments of $339.00 per month to CCCS, she did not make any payments, because she had to devote discretionary funds to car repair.  In June 2000, Applicant 
informed the DSS agent that she could make a first payment to CCCS in mid-July.  Following an extensive review of her income, living expenses and debts, the 
CCCS determined Applicant was not eligible for its program because her debt consisted primarily of student loans.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  In response to the SOR, Applicant 
indicated she had been advised the creditors did not want to comply.  The letter from CCCS does not cite creditor refusal as the reason for Applicant's 
ineligibility.  Assuming the student loan lenders would not work through CCCS, Applicant remains responsible for the student loan obligations (as well as her 
other legitimate debts).  There is no evidence Applicant has taken the initiative to contact the individual creditors in an effort to arrange for repayment.  While 
she indicated in April 2000 that she intended to satisfy the $22.00 radiology debt within the following month, she provided no documentation of any payment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nor is it clear that Applicant's financial situation is under control.  In response to the allegation of falsification, Applicant wrote, "Delinquent student loans are 
not a priority with me.  Rent, light &amp; gas are!"  It may reasonably be inferred that Applicant's failure to address her debts is due to the lack of financial means to 
do so.  Concerning the issue of her having $197.75 in discretionary income available to her each month to devote to debt repayment, Applicant stated only, 
"marital status has changed."  The extent to which this change in marital status impacts her financial situation cannot be determined.  Applicant has failed to 
demonstrate that she has the willingness and present monetary  means to address those delinquent financial obligations for which she remains responsible.  
Adverse findings are warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.l., of the SOR, as those matters remain unaddressed.  
Favorable findings are returned with respect to subparagraphs 1.e., as the Government did not prove the existence of the debt which Applicant disputes; 1.j., as 
Applicant had been working with the utility provider; and 1.k., as while Applicant did not make the payments she told DSS she would make to CCCS, she was 
determined by CCCS to be ineligible for its program.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With Applicant's student loans in default since the mid-1990s, she elected to deny any financial delinquencies when she executed her March 1999 security 
clearance application because she feared disclosure would negatively impact her chance of obtaining the requested clearance.  The deliberate omission of 
relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire raises significant personal conduct concerns.  (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC E2.A5.1.2.2.).  Applicant did not 
deny her financial indebtedness when initially contacted by the DSS special agent, but she lacked definitive answers regarding the accounts identified as bad 
debts in her credit report.<A HREF="01-03838.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  During a subsequent interview of April 2000, Applicant acknowledged her irresponsible handling of her student loan obligations 
and provided an accounting of her indebtedness.  She also admitted to the DSS agent that she had deliberately denied and omitted from her EPSQ her financial 
delinquencies.  While MC E2.A5.1.3.3. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts) has 
potential applicability where an applicant corrects during a DSS interview misrepresentations made on a recent SF 86, thirteen months passed before the 
rectification in this case.  Furthermore, the correction came after Applicant had been presented with the adverse financial information on her credit report.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her candor during her April 2000 and June 2000 interviews notwithstanding, concerns persist as to whether her representations can be relied on.  When 
Applicant filed an amended response to the SOR in October 2001, she denied the deliberate falsification of her security clearance application.  Having already 
admitted to the DSS agent back in April 2000 that she had intentionally omitted her financial delinquencies from her EPSQ, her denial to subparagraph 2.a. 
belies her claim of reform.  An adverse finding is returned with respect to subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>In identifying as Item 5 this Answer notarized on October 9, 2001, Department Counsel mistakenly indicates Applicant requested a hearing.  Department 
Counsel also states in the FORM that Applicant is 32 years of age.  According to the SF 86 executed in March 1999, Applicant is 42 years old.  In her 
Conclusions, Department Counsel makes reference to the SOR as amended.  There was no motion to amend the SOR proposed by either party in the instant 
case. 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant executed the SF 86 as well as two sworn statements using a surname of origin not clearly apparent in the record.  This surname was neither her 
maiden name nor the name by which she was known during her marriage from August 1988 to May 1995.  It is noted that the surname is shared by Applicant's 
daughter who was born in 1981.  Applicant either was married before or she just assumed the same last name as her daughter following her divorce in 1995.  By 
the time she responded to the SOR, Applicant was using the surname of the male person with whom she was cohabitating.  In response to SOR subparagraph 
1.l., Applicant indicated her marital status had changed. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>When interviewed by a Defense Security Service special agent in April 2000, Applicant indicated she borrowed somewhere between $10,000.00 and 
$20,000.00. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>It is not clear when Applicant and her spouse separated.  Their divorce was final in May 1995. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Applicant related in April 2000 that when she and her ex-spouse separated, she was "out on her own as a single parent and focused solely on financially 
providing for [her] daughter."  (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Item 7).  She did not indicate on her security clearance application that she had a child, but in discussing a medical bill for 
pediatric services, she related she had a daughter born in January 1981. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>There is limited information about Applicant's employment during this period.  The record is silent as to her earnings or monthly living expenses during this 
time. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>Applicant listed a monthly debt repayment of $100.00 but did not reveal the nature of the financial obligation(s) being repaid.  It is not at all clear that the 
$339.00 to be paid to CCCS each month was included in this accounting. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>Applicant in April 2000 indicated she owed $219.00 on the dental debt and $9,935.78 on one of her student  loans while the Government alleged Applicant 
owed $228.00 and $9,978.08, respectively.  When Applicant responded to the SOR, she did not dispute the Government's figures.  The difference in the 
amounts may well be due to interest charges. 
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A>It is not clear in the record when Applicant was told she was not eligible for the program.  The only document of record from CCCS is a letter of July 25, 
2001, notifying an unnamed party that Applicant was unable to join the program.  The April 2000 agreement was primarily a retainer, whereby Applicant 
engaged the professional services of CCCS to provide debt management consulting services in negotiating a repayment plan with her creditors. 
<P><A NAME="N_10_">10. </A>According to the sworn statement which Applicant executed in April 2000, during her initial interview, Applicant expressed uncertainty about particular 
accounts in the credit report that were identified as bad debts.  Without knowing of the specifics of the questions asked, it cannot be concluded that Applicant 
intentionally concealed financial information during that initial interview.
