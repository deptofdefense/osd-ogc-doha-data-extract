<P>Applicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in May 2001, and failed to list that arrest and conviction in a security clearance application she submitted 
in January 2002. She has mitigated the security clearance concern caused by her criminal and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 2, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that 
was received by DOHA on March 17, 2004. She admitted both criminal conduct allegations, although it is apparent from her answer that she was unclear as to 
what was being alleged in subparagraph 1.b., and denied the personal conduct allegation. Applicant requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on November 4, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 3, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and 
admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, called her employer to testify on her behalf, and submitted 16 documentary exhibits that were 
marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-16, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on December 9, 2004.        </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 25-year-old single woman who has been employed as a chemist by a government contractor since January 2002. She graduated from high school 
in June 1997, and from college in December 2001 with a bachelor of science degree in marine biology and environmental science. The testimony of her 
supervisor and her performance evaluations establish that she has been highly successful in her work, and is considered to be responsible, dependable, credible 
and trustworthy. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having viewed Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying, along with the substance of her testimony and that of her employer, I find her to be 
a credible witness. Based upon that finding, I find her testimony to be completely truthful. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Negligent Driving in October 2000. She was a college student at the time, and had been 
drinking with friends at a local bar near the college. She was stopped by a police officer after crossing out of her lane of traffic, failed a field sobriety test, and 
registered a 0.18 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on a breathalyser test. On May 14, 2001, Applicant pled guilty to the DWI charge, and the Negligent 
Driving charge was nolle prossed. Applicant was placed on three years probation before judgment, and ordered to perform 180 hours community service, attend 
a victim impact panel, and pay fines and costs totaling $105.00. She completed all terms of probation and it was terminated June 5, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was informed by her attorney that ". . . Probation Before Judgment is not a conviction, inasmuch as the Guilty finding is stricken from your record." 
(AE 3) Applicant understood this advice to mean she did not need to disclose her arrest and conviction to future employers because she had not been found 
guilty and nothing would appear on an arrest record if anyone checked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant electronically submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on January 7, 2002 that she signed on January 9, 2002 as part of her in processing 
with her new job. She answered "No" to question 24: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses - Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any 
offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? . . . </EM>and question 26: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Other Offenses - In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, 
or convicted of any offense(s) not listed is modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.00 unless the violation was alcohol or drug 
related.) . . . .</EM> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was obviously aware she answered the questions incorrectly, but based on the advice she had received from her attorney was unsure if she was 
required to disclose the DWI offense. Very shortly after she submitted the SF 86, Applicant spoke with her employer's facility security officer (FSO), notified 
her of the DWI incident, sought her advice as to whether she was required to disclose the incident, and inquired what she should do. The FSO told her they 
would leave the SF 86 as submitted and if there was an issue with her not disclosing the arrest and conviction she would be contacted, questioned, and could 
clear up any issue that might exist at that time. Although he was not privy to the conversations, Applicant's supervisor saw her consult with the company's FSO 
on several occasions while she was filling out the SF 86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a statement to a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service on June 11, 2002. She explained to the agent her confusion over how to 
answer questions, her reason for being confused, and the action she took to seek guidance from the FSO. She also provided the agent with the names of her 
attorney and the FSO so that her claims could be further substantiated. She also revealed she had not consumed alcohol since the date of her conviction. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-27527.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J based upon the DWI incident. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>applies. Although Applicant was aware that she was providing incorrect answers in the SF 86 she submitted, I do not find her 
action was knowing and willful within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1001, and subparagraph 1.b. is found for Applicant on that basis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The DWI occurred more than four years ago while Applicant was a college student, and it is the only criminal offense she has ever committed. She had not 
consumed any alcohol from the date of her conviction to at least the date she provided a statement to the DSS. Accordingly, Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The 
criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; and MC 6: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM> all apply. Guideline J is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant knew she was answering the SF 86 questions incorrectly, I am satisfied she was not attempting to deliberately provide false or misleading 
information. As a young and inexperienced individual she was genuinely confused on how to answer the questions based upon the advice she received from her 
attorney and what she interpreted that advice to mean. She promptly sought the advice of the FSO, and relied upon that advice to wait until it became an issue to 
further disclose the DWI incident. Accordingly, no disqualifying condition exists. To whatever extent her personal conduct might call into question her security 
clearance eligibility, that concern is overwhelming outweighed by application of MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN></P>
