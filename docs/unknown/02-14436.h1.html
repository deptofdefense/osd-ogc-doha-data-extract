<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that includes two Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges, the last occurring in May 1998, and a repossessed auto on 
which she is now making payments on the deficiency owing after the vehicle was sold. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by the financial 
considerations present in this case. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline F, for financial considerations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on August 29, 2004, denied all SOR allegations except subparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g., and 
did not indicate whether she wanted a hearing or a decision made on the written record. She was notified of the need for her to make an election, and thereafter 
submitted a letter, dated October 10, 2003, electing to have her case decided on the written record without a hearing. On August 23, 2004, Applicant notified 
Department Counsel she had changed her mind and was now requesting a hearing.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on November 4, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 2, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted eleven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11, and 
admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, and submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1, and 
admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant additional time to submit documentation in support of her case. Four 
documents were timely received, marked as AE 2-5, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received by DOHA on December 13, 
2004.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved in writing to amend the SOR on September 8, 2004.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The motion was allowed over Applicant's objection, adding subparagraphs 
1.h., 1.i., and 1.j. in the language stated in the motion. Applicant denied the allegations in subparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i., and admitted the allegation in 
subparagraph 1.j.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved to withdraw subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. based upon information Applicant had appended to her answer to the SOR. That 
motion was granted without objection. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 46 years old, single, and has one son who is 15 years old. She graduated from college and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in secretarial 
science in 1981. She has been employed as a publications specialist by a defense contractor since September 1990. Applicant has possessed a secret security 
clearance since approximately 1990, and there have never been any complaints made alleging she has mishandled classified information. There have no efforts 
to revoke or downgrade her security clearance prior to the action herein in issue.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received a discharge under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code in August 1985. She candidly admits that as a recent college graduate who grew up in 
the projects she had no concept of how to deal with the credit that was extended to her. As a consequence, she made excessive credit card charges wrongly 
anticipating she would be able to pay the bills as they came due. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">She again found herself in financial distress in the mid to late 1990s. Applicant filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code in February 1997. 
That proceeding was eventually converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and Applicant obtained a discharge in May 1998. She attributes her need to file for 
bankruptcy to the events occurring in her life, including unexpected expenses incurred after she purchased a house, and the illness and death of close relatives. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had purchased a house and discovered it had major plumbing problems and an insurmountable rodent infestation. She was forced to expend money 
from her modest income to deal with both issues. During the same time frame, Applicant's grandmother and godmother became terminally ill, with her 
godmother dying in 1997, and her grandmother in 1998. Applicant found it necessary to travel out of state to visit these relatives during their illnesses on a 
regular basis, and again was forced her to expend money on other than her daily living expenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges several delinquent accounts. The first (subparagraph 1.b.) is a bad check in the amount of $61.00 that according to GE 9 dates back to June 
1998. Applicant credibly testified she has no idea what this account is about, and that she contacted the creditor and they had no record of the account. The next 
alleged delinquent account (subparagraph 1.h.) is a revolving charge account that according to GE 9 was charged off in 1996. Applicant stated she did not have 
any knowledge of this account. Considering the account was charged off almost two years prior to her May 1998 discharge in bankruptcy it is likely this 
account was included in the bankruptcy and was therefore discharged in 1998. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The last alleged delinquent accounts (subparagraphs 1.i. and 1.j.) are both judgments based on a repossessed auto from 2000. Applicant credibly testified the 
accounts are one and the same, and the different court numbers for the accounts contained in GE 11 are the result of an appeal that was taken from the 
judgment. She also submitted AE 2 in support of her claim. I find that they do represent a single judgment in the final amount of $8,067.00. Applicant entered 
into a payment plan with this creditor by which she made an initial lump sum payment of $2,000.00 and monthly payments of $250.00 thereafter. AE 5 
discloses that as of November 2004 she was current with the payments and the balance owing has been reduced to $2,354.00  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified her post-1998 bankruptcy financial problems were at least in part caused by the need to move her terminally ill mother into a nursing home 
and to bury her father who didn't leave any money or insurance to cover the costs. Applicant was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2002, and 
underwent surgery in January 2003, although she does not blame any of her financial problems on her health issues.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access 
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="02-14436.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant found herself with unmanageable debt that caused her to file for bankruptcy protection in 1985, and again in 1997. Subsequent to the 1998 discharge 
in bankruptcy, Applicant had an automobile repossessed, and a judgment entered against her on the post resale deficiency owing. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 
1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's second bankruptcy was in large part necessitated by the unforeseen expenses she encountered with the purchase of a house and the illnesses of close 
relatives. Likewise, the death of her father and illness and death of her mother played a large role in the circumstances leading to the auto repossession and 
resulting judgment. Applicant entered into a payment plan with the judgment creditor, has remained current on the payments, and has substantially reduced the 
amount owing. Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts </EM>apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 
6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern 
that existed in this case. She has overcome the case against her and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.    </SPAN></P>
