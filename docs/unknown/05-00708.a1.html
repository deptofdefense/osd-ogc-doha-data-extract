<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 30, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 4, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge 
artin H. Mogul denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline F had 
not been mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by her history of financial difficulties had not been 
mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant essentially reargues her case with respect to the evidence she presented below and also argues that the Judge 
erred with respect to his findings about when she first sought counseling.  The Board does not find Applicant's contention persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The findings which Applicant challenges are permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge.  Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating 
that the Judge's material findings with respect to her conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  
Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings of security concern are sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for 
decision, Applicant still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant's financial problems were 
still ongoing.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-26213 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2006).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length 
and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for 
not applying any mitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was 
insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  The Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is 
not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. 
June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.  Thus, the 
Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.</P>
