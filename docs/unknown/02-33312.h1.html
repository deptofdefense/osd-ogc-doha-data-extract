<P>Applicant failed to report to federal and state authorities income earned as an employee of</P> 
<P>his brother between 1993 and 1996.  While employed by and paid in cash by his brother, he was also at times collecting unemployment compensation from his

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> clearance for Applicant.  On June 3, 2004, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-33312.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-33312.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under  Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  
Applicant provided a complete written response to the SOR on August 13, 2004.   He</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The 
Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 3, 2004.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 8. On 
November 10, 2004, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days 
of receipt.  Applicant did not receive the FORM until December 14, 2004.  He submitted information within 30 days after receiving a copy of the FORM.  On 
January 6, 2005, the case was assigned to me for a decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Five allegations relate to conduct alleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct and one allegation 
relates to conduct alleged under  Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one allegation and denied three allegations.  He 
admitted in part and denied in part two allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old audio visual facilitator employed by a federal contractor.  He has been married twice and is the father of two children, born in 1987 
and 1990.  He is also the stepfather to his second wife's child from a previous marriage.  His background was investigated by the Defense Department for the 
purpose of determining his security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1983 until 1988, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps.  From 1989 to 1997, he served in the Marine Corps Reserve.  He received a 
permanent promotion to Staff Sergeant on May 11, 1995.  (Item 3, Exhibit 9)  Applicant submitted numerous letters of recommendation from Marine Corps 
superiors praising his intelligence, maturity, leadership, and ability to carry out assignments successfully with little or no supervision  (Item 3, Exhibit 5)  Five 
of the letters of recommendation were written in June 1988.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1987, Applicant received a severe head injury in a motor vehicle accident.  He received a speech, language, and cognitive evaluation in January 
1989, which concluded his short term memory had been impaired by the accident but he had, nevertheless, made "remarkable improvement in cognitive 
functioning."  (Item 3,  Exhibit A)  In January 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs determined he was 80 percent disabled and awarded him monthly 
disability compensation of $1474.  (Item 3, Exhibit B.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was fired from a job as a correctional officer in 1993. (Item 4.)  He and his wife separated and there was animosity between them.  In July 1994, 
Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and threatening to kill his wife.  The wife requested and was granted an emergency restraining order.  Applicant 
was ordered to surrender all firearms and the licenses he had to carry firearms.  The police removed a shotgun, revolver, and ammunition from Applicant's 
apartment.  The wife took custody of their two children. (Item 8.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the period from late 1993 to 1996, while he was at times collecting unemployment insurance, Applicant worked as an installer for his brother's flooring 
business.  He was paid in cash and did not report these earnings to state or federal tax authorities.  He presented tax records from 1993 and 1994 showing 
salaries from other employers.  (Item 3, Exhibits C and D.)  In 1994 he received $6,230 in unemployment compensation. (Item 3, Exhibit D.)  In his answer to 
the SOR, Applicant said it was his brother's responsibility, as his employer, to report his income to the proper taxing authorities.  (Item 3, page 3.)  He 
attributed his failure to admit making a verbal threat to kill his first wife to his memory loss problems.  (Item 3, at page 3.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF-86) in April 2002.  In response to Question 20 on the SF-86, he admitted being fired from a job as a 
prison guard in 1993 for allegedly filing a false report.  In response to Question 26 on the SF-86, he denied being arrested or charged with offenses in the seven 
years prior to April 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on June 7, 2002.  In a signed, sworn statement, he admitted being fired from 
another job in 1992.  He denied ever threatening to kill his wife. (Item 5, at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed again by the special agent on July 31, 2002.  In a signed, sworn statement, he admitted receiving unemployment compensation after 
being fired as a prison guard and while working for his brother's business.  He said he was not considered a full time employee and worked only as needed. 
(Item 6, at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed a third time by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on October 11, 2002.  In a signed, sworn statement, he admitted that 
his wife had petitioned for a restraining order against him because he had threatened to kill her and her boyfriend.  He acknowledged allegations of child 
physical abuse relating to his son and stepson.  He admitted being employed by his brother from December 1993 to September 1996.  Some of the employment 
was full time and some was part time.  He admitted his brother paid him in cash and he did not report the income to Federal or State taxing authorities.  He 
admitted he collected the unemployment compensation while working for his brother, and he admitted he did not report his income from employment by his 
brother as he knew he was required to do.  He said he was not truthful about this conduct in his signed sworn statements of June 7, 2002 and July 31, 2002 
because he was afraid he would not get a security clearance if he told the truth. (Item 7, at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On each of the three occasions when he made a statement, reduced to writing, to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant signed and dated an 
acknowledgment which read, in pertinent part, as follows: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I certify that the following statement is true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good faith.  I understand that a 
knowing and willful false statement can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001).  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E,  Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, when he failed to report income earned during a period between 
1993 and 1996 when he was also at times collecting State unemployment compensation benefits (&para; 1.a.); when he failed to report all income earned between 
1993 and 1996 to federal and state tax authorities (&para; 1.b.); when he denied making a verbal threat to kill his former spouse, thereby falsifying material facts in a 
signed, sworn statement dated June 7, 2002 and presented to an authorized investigator of the Department of Defense (&para; 1.c.); when he stated in his signed 
sworn statement of June 7, 2002 that he did not recall his State tax authorities telling him he had collected compensation illegally, when in fact he deliberately 
failed to disclose he had unreported earned income while receiving unemployment compensation benefits (&para;1.d.); and when he falsified material facts by 
stating, in a signed sworn statement dated July 31, 2002, to an authorized investigator of the Department of Defense, that he had never collected unemployment 
benefits fraudulently when he had in fact received unemployment benefits while earning income from working for his brother and not reporting that income 
(&para;1.e.).  Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Applicant refused to provide full, frank and truthful 
answers to lawful questions of investigators in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  &para; E2.A5.1.1.2.  Additionally, Applicant's 
deliberate false statements to an investigator in connection with a personal security or trustworthiness determination raises a concern under &para; E2. A5.1.2.3.  In a 
signed sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, dated June 7, 2002, Applicant denied ever threatening the life of his former wife.  In 
his signed sworn statement of July 31, 2002, he denied ever collecting unemployment compensation fraudulently by not claiming income earned.  In a signed 
sworn statement dated October 11, 2002, he admitted threatening to kill his former wife, receiving  cash payments from employment by his brother from 
December 1993 to September 1996, which he did not report to state and federal taxing authorities, and collecting unemployment compensation while receiving 
income from employment by his brother. Applicant admitted these deliberate falsifications and said he provided false information to the investigators because 
he was concerned that telling the truth about his conduct would prevent him from being granted a security clearance.  (Item 7, at 2.)  His concealment of 
information he considered embarrassing or professionally damaging could make him vulnerable to coercion and blackmail.  &para;E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises 
additional concerns under E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct 
suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  It is well established that embarrassment is not a mitigating 
condition under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.10, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: The information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily. &para;E.2.A.5.1.3.2.  Applicant supplied the correct information when questioned a third time by a special agent of the Defense 
Security Service in October 2002.  His falsifications are recent, and they are not isolated incidents.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. 
of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged the deliberate falsifications Applicant provided to authorized investigators of the Defense Security Service in the signed sworn 
statements identified in allegations 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. constituted felonious criminal conduct under section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code. (&para;2.a.)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided three sworn written statements to special agents of the Defense Security Service and each time signed his name below the following 
statement, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I make this statement without any threats having been made against me or any promise extended to me.  I certify that the following statement is true, complete 
and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false statement can be punished by fine 
or imprisonment or both.  (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, it is a felony to make a writing or document, knowing it contains a materially false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statement.  Applicant admitted preparing and signing written statements in which he lied about personal and criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant 
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's falsifications of his signed, sworn statements occurred in 2002.  These criminal acts were recent, and they were not isolated events.  They 
demonstrate a pattern of criminal conduct.  Thus,  the mitigating conditions at &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1. and E2.A10.1.3.2 of Guideline J do not apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits the criminal conduct alleged by the Government in subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR., a security concern under &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.of Guideline J.  He 
also admits knowingly preparing and signing deliberately false written statements denying personal and criminal conduct alleged in the SOR.  Applicant's acts 
constitute disqualifying conduct under &para; E2.A10.1.2.2. of Guideline J.  None of the Guideline J mitigating factors apply.  Thus, the Guideline J allegation in the 
SOR is concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant</SPAN></P>
