<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant, having accumulated delinquent debts after suffering stock market losses and
tightening finances attributable to significant adoption and family medical expenses, petitioned for
bankruptcy in 2001, and was discharged.  Debts omitted from his bankruptcy have not been pursued
by the creditors, and Applicant has disowned them.  Characterizing these two debts (approximating
about $15,000.00) as (a) his mother's legal obligation which he benefitted from and (b) a charged
off debt of his own that was not pursued by the creditor, Applicant declines to pay either of them. 
His failure to address the outstanding debts attributed to him with the ample resources that have been
available to him precludes him from mitigating the security concerns associated with his judgment
lapses.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On September 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA ), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral
to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or
revoked.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant responded to the SOR on October 3, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was
assigned to me on February 2, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on March 4, 2004.  A hearing
was convened on March 4, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security
clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits.  Applicant relied on one
witness (himself) and six exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on March 16, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

him the opportunity to document legal authority for being excused from a credit card obligation
assumed by another (his mother) but on which he was listed as a user on the card.  There being no
objections from Department Counsel, and good cause being demonstrated, Applicant was granted
14 days in which to supplement the record.  Government, in turn, was afforded 7 days to respond. 
Applicant's March 29, 2004 response was received late and objected to by Department Counsel for 
lack of timeliness.  Applicant's response, while late, will be received and considered as Applicant's
exhibit G.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have experienced financial difficulties.
Specifically, he is alleged to (a) have petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in July 2001
(discharged in November 2001), (b) be indebted to creditor 1.b for $12,061.00 for an account that
was charged off as a bad debt in November 2001, and &copy;) be indebted to creditor 1.b for $2,290.00

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	For his response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted to petitioning for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
relief in July 2001 and receiving his discharge in November 2001, but disputed the amount of the
debts discharged (claiming only $91,034.58 in discharged debts).  Applicant also admitted the debt
to creditor 1.c, but claimed it was inadvertently omitted from his bankruptcy filing.  He denied any
legal obligation to creditor 1.b, claiming the debt belonged to his mother, who was not financially
able to repay the debt.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is a 45-year-old senior financial analyst for a defense contractor and a certified
public accountant by training who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR
and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and
material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant and his wife (W) adopted a little girl from a foreign country in 2000.  The expense
from this adoption, coupled with the $30,000.00 loss Applicant and W encountered in the stock
market in 2000, and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses associated with medical treatment in
his family, created considerable pressure on their already considerable debt structure. Applicant and </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">W borrowed approximately $20,000.00 from Applicant's 401-K retirement fund to take advantage
of stock market opportunities in the late 90s (R.T., at 60).  Before borrowing from the fund to invest
in the market, he and his spouse had earmarked the funds for use in the adoption (R.T., at 60).  To
cover his unanticipated stock market losses, Applicant borrowed anew from his 401-K retirement
fund and obtained a second mortgage on his home to raise the monies needed to pay for his adoption
and the expenses associated with his family's medical needs (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Faced with tightening finances and W's inability to maintain steady employment because of
a medical problem, Applicant and W made the decision in July 2001 to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
relief.   Their July 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition listed secured debts totaling $184,638.31 and
unsecured claims totaling $91,034.58 (<EM>see </EM>ex. 6).  Of the listed unsecured debts, $36,915.02
represented two student loans of W, which survived their bankruptcy.  However, over $25,000.00
of the unsecured debts represent unpaid credit card debts.  W has been unable to work and claims
an exemption from repayment of her outstanding student loans based on a total disability.  It is still
unclear whether her exemption request has been approved by the federal agency supervising her
student loans (<EM>see </EM>ex. G).   At hearing, Applicant could not provide any documentation that his
wife's student loans had been forgiven (R.T., at 55-56).  The balance of his listed unsecured debts
appear to have been discharged in bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant omitted his creditor 1.b and creditor 1.c debts from his bankruptcy filing.  In the
case of his previously charged off 1.b debt for $2,290.00, he claims the debt preceded his bankruptcy
and was inadvertently omitted from his petition.  This debt appears on his latest credit report (ex. 5)
as a debt originated in 1995 and charged off in December 2000.  Applicant attested to its remaining
a legal obligation in the personal financial statement he attached to a statement given to DSS in May
2002 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  After charging off the debts some years ago the creditor has never contacted
Applicant looking for payment (R.T., at 47-51).  Whether or not the debt is currently time-barred is
unclear.  Applicant  will consider payment of this debt only if pressed by the creditor (R.T., at 53).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's other listed debt (covered by creditor 1.b) represents a credit card debt in excess
fo $12,000.00  that was also omitted from his bankruptcy filing.  Applicant acknowledged this debt
as his own in the personal financial statement attached to the statement he gave to DSS in May 2002
(ex. 3), convinced at the time it was debt.   It was not until he double checked his credit report  when
responding to a DOHA interrogatory in April 2003 that he was able to remember that the creditor
1.b debt was actually his mother's credit card that he had used (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4; R.T., at 44-46).   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	At hearing, Applicant acknowledged his purchases on his mother's credit card account
(creditor 1.b) as an added user of the card (R.T., at 67-68).  Over the ten years he used his mother's
card, he made the monthly payments without showing his mother the statements, or denying the
charges were his.  Still, he denies any legal obligation for the charges accumulated on the credit card
(R.T., at 68-71) and relies on the creditor's most recent correspondence confirming his mother as
the obligor as probative of its exempting from liability.  That creditor 1.b continues to treat his
mother as the legal obligor does not document its excuse of Applicant from liability for his use of
the credit card  in his own behalf (<EM>see </EM>ex. E).  Whether (as he insists) he is exempt from liability for
using his mother's card is unclear from either the documentation or testimony reviewed.  However,
Applicant's continued use of the card in the knowledge the creditor expected payment which his
mother could not make reflects poorly on his judgment and trustworthiness.  Because his mother is
not financially able to repay the debt and he believes he is not liable for it, the debt has never been
paid and has since been charged off (R.T. , at 46-47).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant currently earns about $84,000.00 a year, a 20 per cent reduction from his 2001
income.  He attributes the income drop to his loss of overtime pay (R.T., at 41).  Since receipt of the
SOR, Applicant and W have refinanced their home mortgage and taken out a $20,000.00 home
equity loan.  They used the funds they received to purchase home improvements, furnishings and
other personal items and not to repay either of Applicant's listed debts or W's outstanding student
loans.  Applicant has since been to obtain  new car loans on two vehicles.   Applicant continues to
believe he is not responsible for either of the two outstanding listed debts, either because the debt
is not legally his (creditor 1.b) or the debt has been charged off (creditor 1.c) </SPAN></P>

Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so

to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate
determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw
only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. 
Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture	</SPAN></P>

material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant and his spouse accrued considerable debts during the late 90s: some credit card
related, some covering his spouse's student loans, and others related to the medical treatment needs
of his family.  Faced with these mounting debts and anticipated additional expenses in connection
with his planned adoption, he borrowed from his  401-K retirement fund to invest in the stock
market.  He encountered unexpected heavy stock market losses in the 2000 downturn and was forced
to borrow again from his 401-K fund and take out a second mortgage on his own.  When this was
not enough to stabilize his finances he and his spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 2001. 
Two of his major debts were omitted from his bankruptcy petition and were not discharged .</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	At present, Applicant remains obligated, jointly and severally, on one of the two old debts
(<EM>viz., </EM>the one covered by creditor 1.c of the SOR), and potentially obligated on W's student loans and
the purchases he ran up on his mother's credit card without regard to her ability to pay for them, or
his intention to do so.  To date, he continues to resist any payment of these two debts: the first
(covered by creditor 1.b) because he is not legally liable and the second (covered by creditor 1.c)
because the debt has been charged off and should have been included in his bankruptcy.   While
Applicant remains interested in addressing the smaller debt (<EM>viz., </EM>creditor 1.c) should the creditor
pursue him, he has made no attempt to date to initiate payment.   Prospects for the creditor pursuing
him on the obligation are uncertain at this time.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's continued refusal to acknowledge any financial responsibility for his mother's
credit card on which he has secured personal benefits raises serious questions about his willingness
to be personally accountable.  That he would knowingly run up large balances on his mother's card
and put her at risk to collection enforcement action (including adverse credit reporting) manifests
a disposition to prioritize his own needs over a loved one who has placed her trust in him.  It is
difficult to separate this type of disregard for his mother's financial well being from how he could
be expected to protect the Government's interests when faced with a potential conflict with his own
interests.  On the strength of the evidence presented, the Government may invoke two Disqualifying
Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (history of not
meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over time, our Appeal Board has shown general consistency in discounting promises  to take
repayment actions in the future when resources become available.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0012
(December 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 29, 1999).  Put another way, the assumed
possibility an applicant might achieve resolution of his outstanding debts at some future date is not
a substitute for a worthy track record of remedial actions, or evidence of financial reform or
rehabilitation in the present.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0614 (July 12, 1999).  Security clearance
decisions are, of course, never an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about a
person's security eligibility based on the person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See
Department of Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).   Without any meaningful repayment
efforts on either of his two covered debts (not to mention his wife's outstanding student loans) or
definitive plan to address these debts with his current resources, Applicant is unable to mitigate the
security concerns that are  associated with being significantly in debt, or potentially obligated, on
these two debts.  Both of these listed debts were closely preceded by his  2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy
discharge and, as such, reflect part of a continuing pattern of financial difficulties. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	So, while Applicant may take advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's
control) of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate some of the debts associated with his
bankruptcy, he may not invoke the mitigating provisions of MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditors), absent more concerted efforts to address his still outstanding debts.  These
conclusions should in no way suggest that bankruptcy is ever a <EM>per se </EM>reason for denying or revoking
an applicant's clearance.  Bankruptcy by itself reflects a Congressionally prescribed means of
obtaining a fresh credit start.  It is when the circumstances contributing to the bankruptcy are in
recurrent evidence (as is the case here with Applicant's declination to address his two outstanding
major debts) that security concerns arise.  These security concerns have not been mitigated. 
Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through1.c under
Guideline F. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
