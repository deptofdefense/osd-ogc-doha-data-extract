<P>Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the foreign influence security concern based on his family ties to Iran. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 16, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline B for foreign influence. In his Answer to the SOR, dated May 8, 2004, Applicant admitted, with explanation, to the factual allegations 
in the SOR; he also requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on July 19, 2004, and the case was assigned to me the same day. A notice of hearing was issued August 
3, 2004, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2004. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the 
transcript September 2, 2004. Issuing a decision in this case was delayed due to a heavy caseload. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Without objections, SOR subparagraph 1.f was amended to conform to the record evidence as follows: "You traveled to Iran in 2002."</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following essential 
findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old married man who was born in Iran to Iranian parents in 1961. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000. He is seeking to obtain a 
security clearance, for the first time, in conjunction with his employment. </P> 
<P>Applicant is employed as a project manager for a large information technology services company, and he has worked for this company since February 2000.  As 
project manager, Applicant manages and supervises a number of technicians who are installing and configuring an Intranet system on a large military 
installation. Concerning Applicant's work performance, a co-worker of two years testified as a character witness endorsing Applicant's application for a 
security clearance. The co-worker described Applicant as a dedicated, hardworking employee with good management skills. </P> 
<P>In addition to his full-time job, Applicant works part-time as a freelance photographer. In this capacity, he has been assigned to take photographs at high-level 
political events where he was required to submit to a background check to obtain press credentials (Exhibit A), to which he was never denied. Indeed, by all 
appearances, Applicant is a law-abiding citizen of the U.S. </P> 
<P>Applicant was raised and educated in Iran. He earned two bachelor's degrees from Iranian universities, the first in  photography and film production, the second 
in history and political science. </P> 
<P>Applicant was never employed in Iran, and in 1989, he immigrated to the U.S. Applicant has furthered his formal education in the U.S., as evidenced by being 
awarded a certificate in 1999 and a master's degree in 2003. </P> 
<P>Applicant married his wife, a native-born Iranian citizen, in November 1989. The wedding took place in Iran. Applicant returned to the U.S. after the wedding 
and filed the necessary immigration paperwork for his wife to immigrate to the U.S. She entered the U.S. in 1994, and she obtained U.S. citizenship in 2000. 
His spouse also holds a master's degree from an Iranian university, and she has plans to enroll in a Ph.D. program in education. Applicant and his wife have two 
children, both native-born Iranian citizens who have since obtained U.S. citizenship. One of the children, a daughter, is disabled.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's mother and father are both citizens of and residents in the U.S. His mother recently obtained her U.S. citizenship in July 2003. His father has been a 
U.S. citizen since 1999. Also, Applicant has an older brother and a younger sister who are citizens of and residents in the U.S.</P> 
<P>Applicant's older sister is a citizen of and a resident in Iran. She is married to an Iranian citizen. The sister is a housewife and her husband runs a small import-export business. Neither have been employed by the Iranian government. Applicant has monthly contact with his sister, usually by telephone. Applicant does 
not provide any financial assistance to this sister. Applicant's father has filed the necessary immigration paperwork for this sister to immigrate to the U.S. 
(Exhibit B). The immigration petition is still in process, and Applicant does not know when his sister will be allowed to immigrate to the U.S. </P> 
<P>Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of and residents in Iran. Both are in the 70s and retired. Previously, the father-in-law ran a small 
household appliance business and the mother-in-law ran the household. Applicant's wife speaks to her parents in Iran approximately once a month, and she has 
visited them in Iran since coming to the U.S.</P> 
<P>Within the last seven years or so, Applicant has made two trips to Iran for family visits. His wife and children went with him on both trips. The first trip was in 
1998, and the second trip was in 2002. He experienced no problems or difficulties with Iranian officials or authorities during these trips. Applicant has no plans 
to travel to Iran at this time.  </P> 
<P>Administrative or official notice was taken of the certain facts concerning Iran as specified by Department Counsel in Exhibit 4, with reference to Exhibits 5, 6, 
7, and 8. Three areas are highlighted as follows:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>Iran is hostile to the interests of the U.S. and it continues to be one of seven countries the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of 
terrorism. </LI> 
  <LI>Iran is making efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.</LI> 
  <LI>Iran has a poor record of human rights and the government continues to commit numerous and serious abuses, including summary executions, torture 
and other degrading treatment of prisoners, arbitrary arrest and detention, and violence against women. </LI> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of 
affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a 
hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline B. Applicant has close family ties to Iran, as evidenced by his sister 
and parents-in-law who are citizens of and residents in Iran. The strength of the ties is also demonstrated by traveling to Iran for family visits. These 
circumstances raise a security concern under DC 1.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline B and conclude none apply. The only MC deserving serious consideration is MC 1,<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> but it does not 
apply. It appears that none of the family members in Iran are agents of the Iranian government or any other foreign power.<A HREF="02-30772.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> But that does not end the analysis, 
as Applicant must show his family members in Iran are not in position to be exploited by the Iranian government. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In deciding if an applicant has met the second prong of MC 1, it is proper to consider how the foreign country at issue is governed. The focus is not the country 
or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose. This approach recognizes it is nonsensical to treat North Korea as if it were Norway. 
Here, we know Iran is hostile to the U.S. and is ruled by a government with a poor record of human rights. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We also know </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Iran is making efforts to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction, and it is a state sponsor of terrorism. Given these circumstances--which are clearly beyond Applicant's control--the presence of 
Applicant's sister and parents-in-law in Iran places them at risk of being </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">brought under control or used as a hostage by an Iranian intelligence or security 
service</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Unfortunately, his sister and parents-in-law are in a position where there is a potential for them to be exploited in a way that could force him to choose 
between loyalty to his family members and the interests of the U.S. Accordingly, Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security concern, and 
Guideline B is decided against him. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. But this decision should not be construed 
as an indictment of Applicant's loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters are not at issue. Instead, the clearly-consistent standard requires I resolve any 
doubt against Applicant, and his close family ties to Iran creates doubt about his security suitability. In reaching my decision, I have considered the record 
evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
