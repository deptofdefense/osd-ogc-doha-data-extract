<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  On 14 August 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-25750.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR)
detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)
of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 25 September 2003 and elected to have
a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was originally assigned to another judge on 16
January 2004 but was transferred to me 3 February 2004 because of a change in venue.  On 24 March
2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on
5 April  2004.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 24-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1, 2; Tr.
12.  In March 2001, a highway patrol officer received a report from his dispatcher that a vehicle had
been reported weaving on the highway near his location.  The officer pulled out and followed a
vehicle matching the description provided by the dispatcher.  Almost immediately, the vehicle exited
the highway and pulled into a gas station.  The officer followed and pulled in behind the vehicle as
Applicant got out to pump gas.  The officer put on his flashing lights, got out of the vehicle and
approached Applicant.  Ex. 3 at 1, 2.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The officer smelled the odor of alcoholic beverages coming from Applicant.  Applicant's
eyes were watery and red and his face was flushed.  The officer advised Applicant he was being
stopped for impaired driving and asked him if he had been drinking.  Applicant initially denied it,
but later admitted drinking two beers.  Applicant failed to properly perform several field sobriety
tests and the officer took him into custody.  Applicant was taken to the county jail, where he agreed
to take a breath test for alcohol.  Both tests showed Applicnat's blood-alcohol level was significantly
over the level at which the state presumed a driver was impaired.<A HREF="02-25750.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.  Applicant was charged
with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), but the charge was dismissed in August 2001 after
the evidence was suppressed because the officer did not have sufficient evidence of criminal activity. 
<EM>Id. </EM>at 3; Ex. 2 at 3.  Nevertheless, Applicant attended and completed a state approved DUI course
in November 2001.  Ex. 4.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On 19 November 2001, Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA). 
Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any alcohol-related
offense.  Applicant answered "yes" and listed the dismissed DUI charge.  Ex. 1 at 7.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On 4 June 2002, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to an agent of the Defense
Security Service (DSS) concerning his 2001 DUI arrest.  In it, Applicant asserted that, since his
arrest for DUI, he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	I decided to stop drinking alcohol because I did not want it to interfere with my
personal or professional life.  I never felt that I had a problem with alcohol at any
time.  I just decided that I was fortunate enough to have gotten a DUI charge
dismissed and never wanted to put myself in that position again.  I have not thought
about future consumption at this time.  I am just taking my life day by day right now.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Ex. 2 at 2.  Applicant knew this statement was untrue because he had continued to drink alcoholic
beverages after this 2001 arrest.  Answer; Tr. 11.  He claims he falsified the statement because he
was "concerned about [his] job and thought that [he] would lose [his] job right then. [He] was also
concerned about hurting [his] family."  Answer.  </P>

518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec.
Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. 
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865
&sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and
the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed
in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant drove his car while under the influence of alcohol
(&para;1.a.) and deliberately falsified material facts in the signed, sworn statement he submitted to the
DSS agent by claiming he had not consumed alcoholic beverages since his DUI arrest (&para; 1.b.). 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant
may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the
allegations contained in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's DUI is evidence of questionable judgment and may
be disqualifying as reliable, unfavorable information.  DC E2.A5.1.2.1.  Applicant's statement to the
DSS agent that he had stopped drinking alcoholic beverages was a deliberate false statement
concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a personnel security
determination.  DC E2.A5.1.2.3.  It was also the concealment of information that increased his
vulnerability to coercion.  DC E2.A5.1.2.4.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant was 21 years old at the time of the DUI and just short of his 23<SUP>rd</SUP> birthday when he
deliberately falsified his statement.  I considered MC E2.A5.1.3.2.-the falsification was an isolated
incident, was not recent, and the individual subsequently provided correct information
voluntarily-but find it inapplicable to Applicant's case.  The falsification was not an isolated
incident-he also lied to the officer at the time of his arrest concerning the extent of his drinking that
evening-and there is no evidence Applicant provided the correct information voluntarily.  By
admitting in his answer and at the hearing his DUI and his deliberate falsification of the statement,
Applicant took positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,
exploitation, or duress.  MC E2.A5.1.3.5.  After carefully weighing all of the evidence and the
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
