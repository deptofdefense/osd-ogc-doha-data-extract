  Applicant has a record of drug-related convictions prior to 1985.  Twice convicted of OUI in the early 1980's. Applicant was sentenced in 1981 to two years incarceration (suspended) for leaving the scene of an accident with personal injury on the occasion of his second DUI.  After years of controlled  consumption, Applicant in December 1997 drove an automobile so impaired by alcohol that he passed out in the patrol car.  Candid on his SF 86 about his  criminal record history, including his drug arrests, Applicant did not knowingly falsify his application by failing to report that he used marijuana and cocaine  after his employer had granted him a Confidential security clearance.  Applicant is precluded under 10 U.S.C. 986 from being granted a security clearance  because of his two year prison sentence for the 1981 leaving the scene.  His December 1997 DUI creates lingering doubt for his judgment and reliability.   Clearance is denied.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4 and the implementation of Title 10, Section 986 of the 
United States Code), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 9, 2001, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on:  1) criminal conduct due to alcohol offenses committed between 1980 and 1997, with a felony conviction for 
leaving the scene of an alcohol-related accident with personal injury,  and illegal drug offenses committed between 1976 and 1984; and 2) personal conduct 
related to falsification of a February 1999 security clearance application for responding negatively to whether he had ever used illegal drugs while in possession 
of a security clearance.  Applicant's conviction of leaving the scene of an accident with personal injury in May 1981, for which he was sentenced to two years 
incarceration in the adult correctional institution (suspended), was alleged to disqualify him from having a security clearance granted or renewed pursuant to 
Title 10, Section 986 of the United States Code.<A HREF="01-08936.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 21, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was 
assigned to me on September 27, 2001.  Pursuant to formal notice dated October 11, 2001, the hearing was scheduled for October 25, 2001.  At the hearing, 
which was held as scheduled, the Government submitted twelve exhibits,  all of which were entered into the record.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant 
and three witnesses on his behalf.  Applicant also requested that Government Exhibit 11 be considered as Applicant Exhibit A as well.  The document was 
marked and entered accordingly.  With the receipt of the transcript in this office on November 6, 2001, the case is ripe for a decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year-old welder who has worked for a defense contractor (company A) continuously since 1982.  Employed there previously from 1974 until 
he was laid off in 1981, Applicant progressed to a first class pipe welder by late 1981.  On his rehire in December 1982, company A granted Applicant a 
Confidential security clearance ("a green badge") which he has held since.<A HREF="01-08936.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his last year of high school (circa 1972), Applicant started using marijuana with his friends.  His involvement increased gradually to where by 1975 he 
was using cannabis, primarily marijuana but sometimes hashish, on a daily basis.  In at least 1976, Applicant was residing with a friend who he knew used and 
sold marijuana.  On one occasion in August 1976, the police came by their apartment.  Applicant allowed them to search the premises and they found one-half 
to a pound of marijuana belonging to Applicant's roommate.  Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana.  In court he pleaded guilty to an amended 
charge of breach of peace, for which he was fined $35.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant continued to smoke marijuana for the most part daily until his marriage in 1986.  Over the 1975 to 1986 time frame, Applicant spent about $30.00 to 
$35.00 per week for the marijuana he ingested.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Circa 1980, Applicant tried cocaine, which made him feel more alert.  Over the next four to five years, he snorted the drug once per month on average, at a cost 
to him of $40.00 to $50.00 per occasion.  In the early 1980s, he used THC five or six times and LSD twice.  He did not like the effects of those substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A user of alcohol as well, Applicant by the late 1970s was drinking two to three twelve-ounce beers daily during the work week, increasing to five or six beers 
on Fridays and Saturdays.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's use of illicit drugs and alcohol led to his arrest on several occasions over the 1980 to 1985 time frame, as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On an occasion in early June 1980, Applicant imbibed ten twelve-ounce beers at a picnic with friends.  After dropping some friends off, Applicant had a flat 
tire.  When the police stopped to render assistance, the officer arrested Applicant for operating under the influence (OUI) and operating to endanger.  Both 
counts were continued without a finding, and he was placed on probation to January 1981.  Applicant was also ordered to pay costs of $175.00, attend driving 
school, and his license was suspended for three months.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early May 1981, Applicant went out drinking with his then girlfriend to a nightclub where he consumed five to six twelve-ounce beers.  Applicant struck the 
rear of another vehicle at a traffic signal, causing the passenger in the other car to sustain a knee injury.  Both Applicant and the driver of the other vehicle 
exited their automobiles and Applicant suggested they could settle without the police becoming involved.  When a witness to the accident left to call the police, 
Applicant took off at a high rate of speed.  Apprehended in a neighboring state, Applicant was charged in that jurisdiction with OUI.  During a search of 
Applicant incident to his arrest, the police found cocaine in his jacket pocket and a charge of illegal possession was added.  In court in September 1981, he was 
found guilty of OUI and fined $125.00.  The illegal possession of cocaine charge was continued  for one year, to be dismissed on payment of $50.00 plus court 
costs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1981, Applicant was charged in the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred in May 1981 with leaving the scene of an accident with personal injury, a 
felony.  At his arraignment in August 1981, Applicant pleaded not guilty.  In October 1981, he retracted that plea and entered a plea of nolo contendere to the 
charge.  A judgment of conviction was entered and he was sentenced to two years incarceration in the adult correctional institution (suspended), to three years 
supervised probation, and  to pay $30.00 costs.  Applicant now regrets leaving the scene, and regards it as "a stupid thing to do."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While walking down the street one evening in August 1984, Applicant was approached by the police who asked him his purpose.  The police searched 
Applicant and found about a quarter to a half gram of cocaine on him as well as a pipe containing hashish.  The police then arrested him for  possession of 
cocaine, a felony, and possession of hashish.  The charges were subsequently dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three days after his arrest for felony possession of cocaine in August 1984, Applicant was caught smoking marijuana with friends while standing next to his car 
in the parking lot outside  company A.  During a search of Applicant's vehicle, the police found a plastic bag containing sufficient marijuana for two to three 
joints and a table steak knife.  Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of a dangerous weapon in a 
motor vehicle.  In court, Applicant was found guilty of marijuana possession, for which he was fined about $100.00.  The remaining charges were nolle prossed.  
Applicant ceased his use of cocaine in 1985.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In mid-March 1986, Applicant was married to a woman he had been dating for about a year and a half.  With his spouse concerned about his drinking, 
Applicant reduced the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed to two to six beers two or three times per week.  He gradually reduced his marijuana 
smoking from daily to an average of two to three times per week, continuing to smoke at that rate after the birth of his first daughter in January 1987.  Wanting 
to have a positive influence on his then two year old daughter, Applicant quit using cannabis in 1989.  The following year, in October 1990, Applicant and his 
spouse had another daughter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant continued to consume alcohol on average two or three times per week, in quantity varying from two to six beers.  On one occasion in mid-December 
1997, Applicant consumed twelve to fifteen beers when out with his brother and another friend.  At around 2:37 a.m., Applicant was observed driving very 
slowly and swerving.  After Applicant nearly struck the curb, the police pulled him over and began administering field sobriety tests.  Applicant proved unable 
to complete the first test.  Of the opinion that Applicant was too intoxicated to perform the remainder of the sobriety testing, the officer placed Applicant under 
arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI) and operating left of center.  Applicant passed out in the back of the cruiser en route to the 
station, where he then refused to submit to a breathalyser.  A charge of refusal to submit to chemical test was added.  Applicant was then taken to the hospital, 
as he would not provide the name of a responsible party to whom he could be released.  At the county hospital, medical personnel gave him the option of 
calling someone to pick him up or submit to testing.  Applicant continued to refuse to provide the name of someone to whom he could be released, and tests 
were administered.  The hospital subsequently billed him $381.00 for the cost of the testing.  Applicant had not paid the bill by February 2000 as he felt the 
tests were unnecessary.  He had no plans to pay the bill unless ordered to do so by a judge.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative hearing was conducted in February 1998 on the refusal charge.  The charge was sustained and Applicant was ordered on the DUI and refusal 
charges to pay a $200.00 fine plus $27.00 court costs and $500.00  highway safety assessment, his driver's license was suspended for three months, and he was 
ordered to participate in a driving while intoxicated (DWI) program with payment of an assessment fee of $173.00 and to complete ten hours of community 
service.  The left of center charge was dismissed.  Applicant was evaluated by a staff member in the state DWI program in June 1998.  Applicant was directed 
to DWI school rather than counseling as he had positive support from his family and employer and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the December 1997 drunk driving, Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption to twice per week, two to three beers per occasion.  Over the Labor 
Day holiday each year thereafter, Applicant had a party at this residence where he consumed as much as twelve to fifteen beers to intoxication.  Applicant did 
not operate a motor vehicle after drinking in this quantity.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In conjunction with a requested upgrade of his security clearance to Secret, Applicant on February 17, 1999, executed a security clearance application (SF 86).  
In response to inquiries on the form concerning any police record, Applicant responded affirmatively to question 21 regarding any felony offenses, disclosing 
his arrest and conviction in 1981 of leaving the scene after property damage.  He also answered "Yes" to question 24 ["Have you ever been charged with or 
convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  For this item report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been 'sealed' or 
otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which 
the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607."].  He listed his 1976 arrest for possession of marijuana, his 
June 1980 arrest for DWI, his August 1984 arrest for possession of cocaine and marijuana, his May 1981 arrest for DWI and possession of cocaine, and his 
December 1997 DWI.<A HREF="01-08936.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant responded negatively to question 28 ["Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law 
enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public 
safety."] as he was not sure that his Confidential security clearance, which was granted to him by his employer, qualified as a "Federal" security clearance 
warranting an affirmative answer.  In response to inquiries into financial delinquencies, Applicant listed on the form a state tax lien filed against his spouse, and 
the unsatisfied $381.00 debt owed the hospital for testing after his latest DWI.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2000, Applicant was interviewed about his arrest record, drug use, alcohol consumption and financial matters by a special agent of the Defense 
Security Service (DSS). Applicant acknowledged he might not have been correct on his SF 86 about some of his arrest dates, and detailed his involvement in 
the offenses.  Applicant admitted he did not intend to repay the hospital debt for the testing administered after his December 1997 OUI,  unless ordered to do so 
by a judge.  Regarding his use of illegal drugs, Applicant related he stopped using cocaine in 1984 or 1985 and marijuana in 1989.  Applicant maintained he 
reduced his consumption of alcohol following his marriage in 1986, and contended his drinking of twelve to fifteen ounce beers on the occasion of his arrest in 
December 1997 was an isolated incident.  Applicant described his current drinking levels as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since my Dec 97 arrest, I have been drinking only once to twice weekly, about two to three 12 ounce beers each time over about two hour (sic), which will 
make me feel relaxed.  About once yearly, normally on labor day, I will have a party at my home and consume about twelve to fifteen 12 ounce beers over about 
12 to 16 hours of partying.  This will make me relaxed and drunk, but I stay home and will not drive.  In the future I plan to keep my alcohol consumption to 
this level.  I normally do not consume any alcoholic beverages other than beer. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant met with the same agent two days later to discuss why he responded "No" on his SF 86 to question 28 concerning whether he had ever used an illegal 
drug while possessing a security clearance.   Applicant told the agent he incorrectly assumed the question pertained to only the last seven years and he was not 
sure when he completed the form whether the "green badge" he was issued constituted a real security clearance since it was not government issued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was intoxicated in June 2001 while camping out at a bluegrass festival with his family and friends.  No driving was involved on that occasion.   
Applicant's spouse thought Applicant had a problem with alcohol about ten years ago, but she does not think Applicant has a problem now.  When they go out, 
she feels she can have a few drinks because she has no worries that Applicant will be unable to drive them home.  As of October 2001, Applicant was drinking 
"a couple [of beers] at night" once per week.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The pastor of Applicant's church, who has known Applicant for the last three years, regards him as a very stable family man and hard worker.  Applicant 
recently started teaching literacy in a local volunteer program.  Over the years, he has been involved in youth sports in the community, coaching his oldest 
daughter's basketball team.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section

an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J and E:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs (cocaine and marijuana) and alcohol led to his commission of several criminal acts between 1976 and 1984.  
Although Applicant was convicted of an amended charge of breach of peace in 1976, the police found marijuana in his residence.  While the drug belonged to 
his roommate, Applicant was himself a drug user at the time and he knew his friend was involved in drug sales.  He was convicted of drunk driving in 1980 and 
again in 1981. In the May 1981 incident, Applicant caused an accident which resulted in a knee injury to a passenger in the other vehicle.  Fearing his arrest for 
his second OUI, Applicant fled from the scene without waiting for the police to arrive.  Charged in July 1981 with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in 
personal injury, Applicant was convicted of this felony offense and sentenced to two years incarceration (suspended) and three years supervised probation.  In a 
three day time span in August 1984, he was arrested twice on drug charges.  Stopped while he was walking down the street in the first incident, Applicant was 
found to have cocaine and hashish in his possession.  Applicant was caught later that week smoking marijuana outside his automobile in a parking lot near 
company A.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his marriage in March 1986, Applicant had stopped using cocaine.  With his spouse concerned about his drinking, Applicant moderated his alcohol 
consumption, from two to three beers  daily with more on weekends to two to three times per week in amount varying from two to six (12 ounce) beers.  He 
also reduced his marijuana use gradually from daily to an average of two to three days per week.  While Applicant eventually ceased his marijuana involvement 
in 1989, he continued to drink alcohol two to three days per week.  This drinking pattern did not prevent another drunk driving incident, as Applicant consumed 
an excessive amount (twelve to fifteen beers) when out with his brother and a friend in December 1997.  Under the criminal conduct adjudicative guideline, 
disqualifying conditions (DC) a. (allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged), b. (a single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses), and c. (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court martial, of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year) are pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Cognizant of the criminality of his illegal drug use and possession and his drunk driving, Applicant must show for successful rehabilitation a track record of 
compliance with laws and regulations as well as meaningful acknowledgment of responsibility for one's criminal past.  While Applicant asserts the marijuana 
found in his premises in 1976 belonged to his roommate, he has not denied the validity of the remaining criminal charges against him.  With a record of more 
than ten years of abstinence from marijuana and fifteen from cocaine, Applicant has demonstrated his commitment to a drug-free lifestyle.  His illegal drug use 
and possession is not recent.  Since his drug-related criminal convictions were all for drug possession when he was an active user and there is no evidence that 
Applicant has ever dealt or distributed illegal drugs (purchases were for his own use) or that he currently associates with known drug users, there is little 
likelihood Applicant will engage in drug-related criminal conduct in the future.  Subparagraphs 1.a., 1.e., and 1.f. are thus resolved for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not deny his record of drunk driving, which included an accident with personal injury to the victim in May 1981.  Applicant described his 
leaving the scene of an accident in 1981 as "a stupid thing to do."  While his behavior on that occasion was impaired by alcohol, he knew he was leaving the 
scene.  The seriousness of this felonious criminal conduct is reflected in the sentence imposed by the state, which included two years in the custody of the adult 
correctional institution (albeit suspended) with three years of supervised probation.  By virtue of this criminal sentence,  Applicant falls within the provisions of 
Title 10, Section 986 of the United States Code, as amended, which has been implemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, Memorandum 
from the Deputy Secretary of Defense titled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as Mandated by the Floyd D. 
Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Under the current adjudicative guidelines, Applicant cannot be granted a security clearance 
unless meritorious circumstances exist as determined by the Secretary of Defense.  (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> mitigating condition g., Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., 
above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned has 
granted a waiver.).  Subparagraph 1.h. must be  found against Applicant.  Moreover, based on the circumstances of this case, I cannot recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's December 1997 DUI is relatively recent criminal conduct which calls into doubt whether Applicant possesses the requisite judgment and reliability 
which must be demanded of those with access.  Applicant admits he drank twelve to fifteen beers prior to that arrest.  The degree of Applicant's impairment was 
such that the arresting officer felt Applicant was too inebriated to complete the field sobriety testing with safety.  Applicant passed out in the back of the patrol 
car.  Assuming as Applicant claims that this was an aberration in that he had not drank in similar quantity following his marriage in March 1986 to his arrest, 
Applicant still has the burden of overcoming the security concerns engendered by a third drunk driving offense, committed after he had made a concerted effort 
to reduce his drinking.  In February 2000, Applicant described his alcohol consumption since his arrest as once to twice weekly, about two to three 12 ounce 
beers over a two hour period.  He admitted that once yearly, usually on Labor Day, he would consume twelve to fifteen beers over the course of twelve to 
sixteen hours partying.  A friend of Applicant's testified she last saw Applicant intoxicated in June 2001 at a bluegrass festival.  While there is no evidence 
Applicant has driven an automobile after drinking to excess since December 1997, the risk of future alcohol-related criminal conduct cannot be discounted.  
Adverse findings are warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.g. of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case under guideline E, personal conduct, is based solely on Applicant's failure to respond affirmatively to question 28 on the SF 86, which 
he executed on February 17, 1999.<A HREF="01-08936.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant does not dispute that he used both marijuana and cocaine while he had a "green badge."  An affirmative response 
is required to question 28 if one has ever used an illegal drug while possessing a security clearance.  Applicant denies any knowing falsification of his SF 86, 
maintaining that he was unaware that a company granted security clearance was the same as a DoD granted Confidential security clearance.  Notwithstanding 
Applicant back in December 1982 executed  a DoD security briefing statement, I am persuaded Applicant did not knowingly falsify his response to question 28 
on his 1999 SF 86.  Applicant listed on his SF 86 his arrests for illegal drug possession, which lends credence to his claim of no intent to conceal his illicit 
substance involvement.  Subparagraph 2.a. is resolved in his favor, as he did not engage in deliberate misrepresentation when he completed his security 
clearance application.</SPAN></P>
