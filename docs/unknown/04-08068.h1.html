<P>Applicant's wife is a citizen of Sri Lanka and employed by an international organization.  As a young man, he lived with his father, who held a high position in 
the Sri Lanka government. Applicant's uncle, a citizen of Sri Lanka, holds an appointed position in the government of Sri Lanka.  Applicant has several friends 
who also hold high-level positions in the government of Sri Lanka.  He is an unofficial point of contact for Sri Lankans who come to the U.S. for business and 
tourism.  Applicant has traveled to Sri Lanka five times since 1995.  He plans to travel to Sri Lanka in December 2005 to visit friends and family.  Applicant's 
familial and social ties to citizens of Sri Lanka raise serious security concerns because they could be exploited by terrorist groups operating inside Sri Lanka,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On March 4,  2005, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="04-08068.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-08068.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing March 15, 2005, and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  On July 7, 2005, the case was assigned to me.  I convened a hearing on August 31, 2005, to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses, introduced two exhibits, and 
offered four documents for administrative notice.  Applicant called no witnesses.  He introduced nine exhibits and offered two popular press articles for 
administrative notice.  The Government's exhibits (Ex.) were numbered 1 and 2, and its documents offered for administrative notice were numbered I through 
IV. Applicant's exhibits (Ex.) were identified as A through I, and his documents offered for administrative notice were designated A-I and A-II.  All exhibits 
and documents were admitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding September 13, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven 
allegations and admitted in part and denied in part one allegation.  At the close of the hearing, the parties agreed to two changes to the SOR to conform the 
allegations with facts elicited at the hearing.  The first stipulated change substituted the word  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">acquaintance</SPAN> for the word <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">friend</SPAN> in SOR allegation 1.f. and 
further deleted a present tense description of employment and substituted in its place a past tense description of employment.  The second stipulated change 
deleted the year 2004 from a list of years in SOR allegation 1.g.  With these changes in place, Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR.  His admissions 
are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 47 years old and has been employed since 2000 as a senior member of the professional staff of a government contractor.  His work involves 
software quality assurance and testing.  (Ex. 1; Ex. G.)  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995. (Ex. 1.)  Applicant does not need a security clearance to 
carry out his present job, but if he were granted a security clearance, he would increase his opportunities for additional assignments within his company.  (Tr. 
32-33.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Sri Lanka.  From 1978 to 1981, he lived with his father, a high-level official of the government of Sri Lanka, when his father was on 
assignment in the U.S.  Applicant's father is deceased.  (Ex. 1.)  Applicant attended college in the U.S.  ( Ex. 1; Tr. 53.)  Before taking his present job, 
Applicant worked as a language and culture instructor for the U.S. government.  In that work, he provided translation services for officials in the U.S. and Sri 
Lanka governments at government-sponsored meetings. (Tr. 57.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is married and he and his wife have two grown children, both of whom are in college in the U.S.  (Tr. 40-41.)  Applicant's wife has been living in the 
U.S. since 1978.  She is a citizen of Sri Lanka and is employed by an international organization.  She has elected not to become a U.S. citizen because, if she 
retains her Sri Lanka nationality, her employer will provide education benefits to their children and will pay travel costs for a home visit to Sri Lanka for her 
and her family every two years. (Tr. 39-40.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Sri Lanka with his family in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2003.  When Applicant and his family traveled to Sri Lanka, they stayed in the 
home of his wife's aunt.  Applicant intends to travel with his family to Sri Lanka in December 2005, and they will stay again with his wife's aunt.  (Tr. 35-36.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has numerous family members and friends in Sri Lanka.  His uncle is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka and holds an important appointed position in 
the Sri Lanka government.  ( Tr. 41-42.)  The uncle's wife is a teacher and an employee of the Sri Lanka government.  (Tr. 44.)  Applicant last met with his 
uncle in September 2004.  (Tr. 43.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a friend who is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka who holds a high-level legal position in the Sri Lanka government.  He visited the friend when 
he was in Sri Lanka in 2003.  (Tr. 44- 45.)  He has another  friend, a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka, who is a high-level police official in the Sri Lanka 
government.  Applicant and the official went to the same high school in Sri Lanka and Applicant met him when he came to the U.S. many years later on official 
business.  When Applicant was in Sri Lanka in 2003, the official invited him and his family to his home for dinner (46-48.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another friend of the Applicant's, a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka, is a physician who holds a high appointment in a government hospital in Sri Lanka.  
Applicant last met this friend in 2003 when he was in Sri Lanka.  He said he considered his friendship with the physician to be " a very valuable contact, 
because [in Sri Lanka] . . . even if you have so much money, you still won't get good care unless you know . . . personally some doctors." (Tr 50.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an acquaintance who is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka who, until recently, held a high level position in the Sri Lanka military.  (Tr. 51-52; 
Ex. A- II)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his hearing, Applicant stated that his name is given out in certain circles as a person to contact for assistance in the U.S.  He said he often receives calls from 
citizens of Sri Lanka who come to the U.S. for government-sponsored activities. (Tr. 58.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his hearing, Applicant explained that it is important to know people of influence when visiting third world countries. (Tr. 48.)  To support his observation, 
he recollected that when he and his family were in Sri Lanka on a visit several years ago, terrorists attacked and destroyed all the airplanes at the country's only 
international airport.  The next day, Applicant and his family were scheduled to fly home to the U.S.  The government decreed that only foreigners could leave 
the country.  Applicant explained: "At that point, I had to use some influence to get my family out of town, out of harm's way.  So knowing such people when 
we visit is a big plus." (Tr. 48.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I take administrative notice of a Counselor Information Sheet on Sri Lanka, prepared by the Bureau of Counselor Affairs, U.S. Department of State, dated 
January 21, 2005, and current as of June 28, 2005, which states that terrorist activities in the city of Columbo and other areas of Sri Lanka are a serious threat.  
oreover, the information sheet alerts Americans traveling in Sri Lanka to be aware of increasing crime and violent incidents and to be aware that they cannot 
safely travel to certain locations within the country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The information sheet reports that since 1997, a group in Sri Lanka identified as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been on the Department of 
State's list of foreign terrorist organizations .  The LTTE is identified as the group which attacked Columbo International Airport on July 24, 2001, destroyed 
commercial and military aircraft, and killed military and airport employees.  Additionally, the LTTE has attempted or carried out many political assassinations 
and suicide bombings.  While the LTTE has not specifically targeted U.S. citizens, it has planned and executed operations with the knowledge that Americans 
and other foreigners might be killed or injured. <A HREF="http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/industrial/(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/hgn/5314.htm.)"></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the amended SOR, the Government alleged, under Guideline B of the Directive, that Applicant's wife is a citizen of Sri Lanka (&para; 1.a.); that Applicant's uncle 
is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka who is employed in a high-level appointed position in the government of Sri Lanka (&para; 1.b.);  that Applicant has a friend 
who is a citizen of Sri Lanka and employed in a high-level legal position by the government of Sri Lanka (&para;1.c.); that Applicant has a friend who is a citizen of 
Sri Lanka and employed in a high-level police position by the government of Sri Lanka  (&para; 1.d.); that Applicant has a friend, who is a citizen of Sri Lanka, and 
employed by the government of Sri Lanka in a high-level medical position (&para; 1.e.); that Applicant has an acquaintance who is a citizen of Sri Lanka and who 
was employed in a high-level military position by the government of Sri Lanka (&para;1.f.); that Applicant traveled to Sri Lanka in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003 
(&para;1.g.); and that from at least June 1978 to June 1981, Applicant resided in the U.S. with his father, who was a high-level official of the government of Sri 
Lanka (&para; 1.h.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Guideline B security concern may exist when an individual seeking clearance is bound by ties of affection, influence, or obligation to immediate family, close 
friends, or professional associates in a foreign country, or to persons in the United States whose first loyalties are to a foreign country. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  &para;E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who places a high value on family obligations or fidelity to relationships in another country may be vulnerable to duress by the intelligence service of 
the foreign country or by agents from that country engaged in industrial espionage, terrorism or other criminal activity.  The more faithful an individual is to 
family ties and obligations, the more likely the chance that the ties might be exploited to the detriment of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's case requires the recognition that at least one international terrorist group is operating in Sri Lanka and is taking actions that could cause death or 
harm to U.S. citizens and interests.  These  actions  threaten U.S. security interests.  American citizens with immediate family members who are citizens or 
residents of Sri Lanka could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits all allegations in the SOR.  His admissions raise security concerns under  Guideline B of the Directive. Applicant's wife, with whom he lives 
and with whom he shares his home, is a citizen of Sri Lanka. His father, now deceased, was connected with the government of Sri Lanka.  His uncle, a citizen 
of Sri Lanka, is an appointed official in the Sri Lanka government.  Applicant has three associates who are connected with the government of Sri Lanka and one 
associate who was, until recently, connected with the government of Sri Lanka.  These facts raise security concerns under &para;&para;  E2.A2.1.2.1., E2.A2.1.2.2., and  
E2.A2.1.2.3. of Guideline B.  In his answer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant acknowledged five trips to Sri Lanka since 1995, and he stated he intends 
in the future to make a trip to Sri Lanka.  Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.6., these actions could make Applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by 
individuals or groups in Sri Lanka hostile to the U.S. and its policies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns by demonstrating that foreign associates are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the foreign associates and loyalty to the U.S. &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  
While the evidence does not establish that Applicant's wife is an agent of a foreign power, she is a citizen of Sri Lanka and may be subject to duress because of 
her citizenship and her relationship with the Applicant.  Additionally, she shares Applicant's living quarters while the potential for adverse foreign influence or 
duress exists.  Accordingly, Applicant's wife could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to his wife and 
loyalty to the United States.  Thus, mitigating condition &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. is inapplicable to the citizenship and relationship status of Applicant's wife.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's late father held a high position in the government of Sri Lanka.  His uncle is at present a high government official in Sri Lanka.  Three of 
Applicant's associates hold positions in the government of Sri Lanka.  The fourth associate, until recently, held a high position in the military services of Sri 
Lanka. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is deceased and no longer connected with the government of Sri Lanka.  He is no longer in a position to be personally exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his father and the United States.  Accordingly, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. applies to the alleged 
security concerns relating to Applicant's late father.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same cannot be said for security concerns relating to the citizenship and employment of Applicant's uncle and three of Applicant's associates, all of whom 
are citizens of Sri Lanka and currently employed by the government of Sri Lanka.  While Applicant's fourth associate no longer carries out a high-level military 
assignment, he remains in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his associate and loyalty to the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, Applicant's uncle and four associates are citizens of a unstable country where groups with interests antithetical to the United States are not 
constrained from acting against U.S. interests.  Applicant offered no evidence to rebut the Government's assertion that his uncle and associates in Sri Lanka 
could be exploited by these groups in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to them and the security interests of the United States.  ( <EM>See </EM>ISCR 
Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 (App. Bd. June 2, 2005)  Accordingly, mitigating condition  &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. of Guideline B does not apply to the allegations 
specifying Applicant's relationships with his uncle and four associates.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's personal travel to Sri Lanka with his immediate family in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003, raises security concerns because it evinces conduct 
that may make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government.  &para; E2.A2.1.2.6.  An applicant may  mitigate foreign influence 
security concerns if he shows his contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are the result of United States official government business or are casual 
and infrequent. &para;&para; E2.A2.1.3.2. and E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant's contacts with  these citizens of Sri Lanka are not casual but derive from affection, influence, and 
obligation and are not the result of official government business. While there is no record evidence to suggest Applicant's uncle and four associates in Sri Lanka 
are hostile to the U.S., they are agents of the government they serve and each could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to 
choose between loyalty to them and to the U.S.  Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at &para;&para; E2.A2.1.3.2. and E2.A2.1.3.2. of Guideline B are inapplicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nothing in Applicant's answers to the SOR suggested he was not a loyal American citizen and a credit to his adopted country.  However, he was unable to put 
forward evidence that could mitigate the security concerns alleged in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. of the SOR and demonstrate he would not be vulnerable to 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. under Guideline B 
of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.  Subparagraph 1.h. is decided for Applicant for the reasons discussed herein.</SPAN></P>
