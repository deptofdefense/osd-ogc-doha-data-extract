<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's dual citizenship, including possession of a valid foreign passport has been mitigated.  Furthermore, the Applicant did not intentionally falsify a  
security clearance application.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 2, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on April 6, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 27, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 9, 2004.   At the hearing the Government 
presented eight exhibits.  The Applicant presented nine exhibits.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 25, 
2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, clarifying "the application of Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  The Applicant received a 
copy of this memorandum.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 30 years of age and holds a 
aster's Degree in Integrated Manufacturing Engineering. He is employed as a Engineer for a  defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection 
with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States.  He was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1973.  He immigrated with his family to the United States as 
a child in May 1981.  He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in September 1995.  He has enjoyed the privilege of being an American.  In 
December 1999, after becoming a naturalized United States citizen, he renewed his Taiwanese passport.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 11, 2002, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service.  At that time, the Applicant possessed his Taiwanese 
passport that was issued on December 6, 1999.  (See Government Exhibit 3).  The passport will not expire until December 6, 2005.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 
5).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since learning of the provisions of the Money Memorandum, the Applicant surrendered his passport to the Taiwan Economic and Cultural office.  He received 
his Loss of Nationality Certificate from the Taiwanese Minister of Interior.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit D).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant does not consider himself to be a dual citizen.  He considers himself to be an American exclusively.  He explained that he listed his dual 
citizenship on his security clearance application because at that time he had an active Taiwanese passport, but for no other reason.  (Tr. p. 32).  He is planning 
his future in the United States and has no intentions to ever leave.  He is married and they are expecting their first child soon.  Both he and his wife are in the 
mainstream of American society.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant traveled to Taiwan in July 1995 and again in May 2000 for vacation only.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother, father, sisters and brother all live in the United States.  He does not maintain close contact with any of his extended relatives in 
Taiwan.  There is no evidence in the record that any of the Applicant's family in the United States or those that reside in Taiwan have any affiliation with the 
Taiwanese Government whatsoever.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has purchased a house in the United States and has a retirement plan established by his company.  He has no assets of any kind in Taiwan.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a security clearance application dated April 16, 2001.  Question 15 of the application asked him, "In the last seven years , have you 
had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 1).  This was a false answer.  The 
Applicant was issued a Taiwanese passport on December 6, 1999.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 5)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 16 of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant, "Have you traveled outside the  United States on other than official United States Government 
orders in the last seven years?"  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 1).  This was a false answer. The Applicant actually traveled to Taiwan 
in July 1995 and May 2000.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that his responses to both questions set forth above were simply careless mistakes.  He attributes the wrong information to the 
company's security representative either entering the wrong information in the computer, and/or  his own failure to verify all of the information before signing 
the document.  (Tr. p. -).  The Applicant provided an excerpt of the original security clearance application that contained his handwritten answers.  Both 
questions 15 and 16 were left blank on his handwritten application.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant Exhibit G).  The Applicant testified that his only explanation for this was 
that at the time he was filling out the application, he did not have his passport, dates of travel, and other specific information he thought he needed to fill it out 
accurately.  He stated that in the rush to complete the application he did not go back to review it.  In failing to do that, he believes that the company security 
representative just entered whatever default information into the system just so that the system would let her continue.  (Tr. pp. 36-37).  He further stated that he 
was never asked by the company security representative to verify any information on his security clearance application.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the Applicant started with the company, the security process has been revised which now allows the applicant to key-in or enter the information in the 
system themselves instead of someone else doing it.  This was done to streamline the process as well as to minimize the potential for errors.  (<EM>See </EM>Tr. p. 36 and 
Applicant Exhibit F).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant indicated that during his interview with DSS, he discovered that there was wrong information on his security clearance application in response to 
questions 15 and 16.  (Tr. P. 38).  He did not ever attempt to falsify any information on his security clearance application.  (Tr.  p. 38).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three character references from the Applicant's professional colleagues and a long time friend collectively indicate that the Applicant is considered dependable, 
honest, forthright, competent, conscientious and dedicated to his job and family.  He would never knowingly misrepresent himself to anyone.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's 
Exhibit H).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the 
person(s) involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct) that 
establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse 
conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence 
is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to 
place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security 
clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign connections have a 
direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Taiwan, but was raised in the United States.  He became a naturalized citizen of the United States.  Although he obtained a 
Taiwanese passport after becoming a United States citizen, he used it for no purpose at all.  He traveled to Taiwan on two occasions and always used his United 
States passport.  Since learning that possession of a foreign passport is not permitted when holding a security clearance, in compliance with the provisions of 
the Money Memorandum, he surrendered his Taiwanese passport to the appropriate legal authorities, and it has been cancelled.  With respect to his Taiwanese 
citizenship, the Applicant has renounced it.  Under the circumstances, the Applicant has done everything possible to be in compliance with the requirements of 
the directive and the Money Memorandum.  Accordingly, he has clearly demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the 
circumstances of this case, I find for the Applicant under Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  All of the Applicant's immediate family reside in the 
United States.  The Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives are not of a nature to influence his security worthiness.  There is no evidence in the record 
that any of his family or friends have any connection with the Taiwanese Government, or are in a position to be exploited by the Taiwanese Government in a 
way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the United States.  Based on the foregoing, this does not raise a security 
concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance application in response to questions 15 and 16.  He was careless and should have reviewed the 
source document before submitting it to the security representative for her entering of information into the computer.  However, the mistake could also have 
been made by her.  The Applicant did not pass the blame but credibly testified that he was at fault for failing to review this important document.  He stated that 
in no way did he attempt to falsify it.  Furthermore, during his interview with DSS, the Applicant was the one to bring to the attention of the investigator these 
two specific errors in the application.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline C, B and Guideline E of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C, B and E.</SPAN></P>
