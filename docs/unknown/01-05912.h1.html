<P>Applicant's occasional use of marijuana on three separate occasions during the period estimated as January 1994 to Easter Sunday 1997--while in his late 30s--as well 
as his stated position that, if given the opportunity to smoke marijuana while socializing with friends in the future, he might do so--a position which he stated in May 2000 
and restated in April 2001, and only rejected in May 2001--is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">continued</SPAN> access to the nation's secrets.  In the absence 
of a "demonstrated intent" not to abuse any drugs in the future, grave questions and doubts are raised as to his security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 2, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated April 4, 2001, but notarized on April 5, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his 
case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on April 11, 2001.  A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  
He submitted a handwritten response on May 14, 2001.  Department Counsel interposed no objection to the submission.  The case was initially assigned to 
Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman on June 5, 2001, but, due to caseload considerations, was subsequently reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative 
Judge on June 7, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline H (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to retain a security clearance, the level of which has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was an illegal substance abuser whose substance of choice was marijuana.  He experimented with marijuana on about three occasions--while in his late 
30s--during the period estimated as January 1994 to Easter Sunday, 1997.<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  While he used marijuana socializing with friends and acquaintances at parties when it was 
offered to him,<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant's motivation for doing so is unknown, although he conceded his use was "recreational."<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  His marijuana use was occasioned by feelings of 
becoming light headed, dizzy, and high.<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although, supposedly, he has not used marijuana since April 1997, Applicant's motivation for ceasing such marijuana use is unknown.  In May 2000, during an interview 
with a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), and the following year, in April 2001, in response to the SOR,<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> with regard to future intent, Applicant 
stated:<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the future if given the opportunity to smoke marijuana while socializing with friends I might engage in smoking marijuana.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2001, in response to the FORM, Applicant apparently underwent a conversion regarding future intent and, admitting his marijuana use was a mistake, altered his 
views.  As of May 14, 2001, he vowed to abstain from any future illegal marijuana activity because it might place his job in jeopardy.<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence to rebut 
Applicant's contention that he has abstained since May 26, 2000.  The record is silent regarding possible marijuana used during the period from April 1997 to May 2000, 
and there is no allegation that the marijuana use continued beyond "about April 1997."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never undergone any treatment or rehabilitation related to his marijuana abuse.<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the period of his marijuana abuse, Applicant never purchased marijuana and he never sold marijuana.<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant seeks "continued access to classified information,"<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> it is not clear if he possessed a security clearance at the time of his marijuana use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by the same company since August 1984.  The quality of his performance has not been revealed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for 
access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are 
intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge 
should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Guideline H - Drug Involvement]: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(i) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, 
narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(ii) inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse (see above definition);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional.  <EM>Recent</EM> drug involvement, especially following the 
granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will <EM>almost invariably</EM> result in an unfavorable determination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of 
the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="01-05912.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the 
Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, 
the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts 
raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those 
described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Criterion H, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's improper and illegal occasional use of marijuana on three separate occasions during the 
period estimated as January 1994 to Easter Sunday 1997, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">continued</SPAN> access to the nation's secrets.  Applicant was 
not a teenager who simply experimented one time out of curiosity and stopped.  Instead, as a seemingly more mature person in his late 30s, and motivated by social 
pleasures not further explained</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">notwithstanding the illegal status of his endeavor, he exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature 
behavior, and continued his marijuana use on two other occasions during that three year period.  Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his marijuana use clearly falls 
within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It might reasonably be argued the drug involvement, ending in about April 1997, was not recent, a condition recognized under Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 
(MC) E2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> A8.1.3.1. However, while the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes are significant factors in the overall adjudicative 
process, the presence or absence of one particular condition is not controlling.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite marijuana use on three occasions covering a three year period--conduct which I believe takes it out of consideration as isolated or aberrational in nature under 
C E2.A8.1.3.2.-- accompanied by a period of abstinence, Applicant has seemingly not undergone any drug awareness, education, or treatment program, in order to 
achieve a better self-understanding of the behavioral and psychological effects of his actions and the motivation therefore.  Likewise, simply superficially claiming that 
continued social pleasures at the parties he attended were motivators, does not signify true insight into the actual motivation for following the course of conduct which he 
had chosen. Applicant continued to abuse marijuana to enhance his pleasure.  Without the development of meaningful countermeasures to the resumption of substance 
abuse--relapse prevention, the likelihood of recurrence becomes greater.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this instance, while crediting Applicant with the wisdom of finally ceasing his marijuana use and remaining abstinent since about April 1997, I believe both the successful 
completion of a drug treatment and rehabilitation program, as well as confirmed abstinence for a reasonable period should be required to demonstrate the truly successful 
transformation from substance abuser to an abstinent, drug-free person, and to provide the basis for a conclusion that such conduct will not continue or recur at some 
party in the future.  I am aware there may be no such mandate, but under the evidence presented, I possess little confidence that Applicant's substance abuse is a thing of 
the past that will not recur.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this regard, I am particularly concerned about Applicant's longstanding failure, until one month ago, to understand the significance of the situation regarding substance 
abuse.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Until his recent purported conversion, it was clearly Applicant's position that in the future, if given the opportunity to smoke marijuana while socializing with 
friends, he might engage in smoking marijuana.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  That orientation, initially professed by Applicant in May 2000, and reiterated in April 2001, cannot be construed as a 
"demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future," </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC E2.A8.1.3.3.  Furthermore, as pointed out in DC E2.A8.1.2.5., "an expressed intent not to 
discontinue use, will </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>almost invariably</EM> result in an unfavorable determination."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is to be acknowledged that as of May 14, 2001, Applicant seemingly rejected future illegal substance abuse by abruptly vowing to forego marijuana in the future.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">That 
simple pledge, accompanied only by a newly discovered superficial understanding that the use of marijuana is a mistake which might cause the loss of access to classified 
information and place his job in jeopardy, does not, in my estimation, sufficiently constitute a "demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Moreover, I 
remain unconvinced of Applicant's credibility in this regard.  Furthermore, I am troubled by Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">failure to appreciate the illegality of his endeavor.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, and my 
application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, I believe that Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case.  The evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
