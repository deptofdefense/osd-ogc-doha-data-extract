<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 3, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On August 11, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on September 8, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The hearing was initially scheduled for April 19, 
2006, with Judge Hogan.  Applicant was not present when his hearing was convened.  Applicant had an acceptable reason for his absence, and his request to reschedule his hearing was granted.  On 
October 13, 2006, the case was reassigned to me.  On November 2, 2006, the hearing was held.  On November 28, 2006, DOHA received the record of the hearing (R.), and on December 4, 2006, 
the transcript was provided to me.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel made a motion to amend the SOR to add subparagraph 1(a)(2), which would allege that in June 1999 or 2000, Applicant was charged with driving with a revoked license, 
driving an uninsured vehicle, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia (R. 11).  He pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia in accordance with his plea agreement, 
and the other charges were dismissed (R. 11).  Applicant did not object to the amendment, instead he explained that he "came clean" during his Defense Security Service (DSS) interview about the 
1999 offense (R. 12).  I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR (R. 12).</P> 
 
<P>With the concurrence of the parties, I accepted Applicant's opening statement as evidence (R. 16-23).  His opening statement was consistent with his subsequent statement during his presentation of 
his case. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant admitted that he incorrectly failed to list a 1992 conviction for possession of marijuana in response to Question 24 on his 2003 SF 86.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He contended that 
his erroneous answer to Question 24 was based on his belief that he did not have to list this offense because it was expunged.  He also answered "No" in response to Question 27, which pertained to 
whether he illegally used drugs in the last seven years.  However, he asserted his answer to Question 27 was accurate.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 31-years-old.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He was employed as a network administrator for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He was recently awarded a bachelor of arts degree (R. 5, 32).  From October 2001 to March 
2002, he attended vocational school, and obtained his MSFT Certification.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant has no prior military service.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant is not married.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN>He applied for an upgrade of his clearance in 
2005 from Secret to Top Secret (R. 34-35).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations pertain to whether Applicant knowingly and deliberately falsified Questions 24 and 27, of his April 3, 2003, SF 86.  Applicant did not list a 1992 marijuana possession charge and 
conviction, and a 2000 marijuana possession charge.  He admitted these charges and the 1992 marijuana possession conviction occurred.  Additionally, the SOR alleges he used marijuana until at 
least 1998 or 1999, and omitted this information from his 2003 SF 86.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1992 while he was in high school, the police pulled him out of class, searched his car, and found a small amount of marijuana that he was keeping in a film case in his car.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He pleaded guilty, 
and was sentenced to perform 24 hours of community service (R. 38).  He was also required to provide a urine sample for testing every week for 90 days.  After he completed the community service 
and urinalysis testing, his record was expunged.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000,<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia (rolling papers).  Exhibit 2<EM>, </EM>at 4.  He denied that the marijuana and rolling papers were his, but 
pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia (<EM>Id.</EM>; R. 49).  At his hearing on November 2, 2006, he said he met someone in a bar, and agreed to give him a ride home (R. 53).  The acquaintance 
he met in a bar "dumped his stuff in [Applicant's] car and [Applicant] was forced to take responsibility for" his passenger's marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia (R. 19, 53).  The police found the 
marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia under the passenger's seat in his car (R. 53).  His passenger was not charged (R. 53).  The possession of marijuana charge was dismissed,<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and he paid a 
$100 fine for possession of drug paraphernalia (R. 50).  Applicant's response to Question 26 of his 2003 SF 86 indicates that in 1999 he received a citation for "possession of cigarette paper" 
(Exhibit 1, at 9).   He did not list the 2000 possession of marijuana charge on his 2003 SF 86 because he was focused on the lack of conviction aspect of the marijuana possession (R. 37).  He had 
also been filling out some other employment applications at that time which asked about convictions rather than arrests or charges (R. 37).  He read the question, but ascribed his inaccurate answer 
to a mistake (R. 38).  I find there is substantial evidence that he possessed marijuana in 2000.  <EM>See</EM> Exhibit 2, at 4.  Moreover, his 2000 arrest for marijuana possession provides some corroboration 
for his 2004 DSS statement about his marijuana involvement continuing into 1998/1999.  I do not find his statement at his 2006 security clearance hearing about mistakenly omitting the 2000 
marijuana possession charge to be credible.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2003, Applicant answered Question 24 of his 2003 SF 86, which concerns his police record pertaining to his alcohol and drug offenses.  It instructs, "For this item, report information regardless 
of whether the record in your case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record."  Applicant read the question before he answered it (R. 35).  Question 24 asks the following question, 
"Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?"<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant  listed a driving while impaired offense occurring on March 5, 1995, but did not list his 
1992 charge of marijuana possession.  Applicant explained that the 1995 DUI was actually a conviction for a type of underage drinking ( R. 36).  In his 2005 response to the SOR, Applicant stated 
that his employer rushed him and he did not have time to check his police record.  Additionally, he believed the marijuana offense, which occurred when he was in high school was expunged.  <EM>Id.</EM>  
He believed that when a record was expunged, it is as though it never occurred, and he did not have to reflect this information on his security clearance application. <EM> Id.</EM> At the time he signed his 
2003 SF 86, he was aware that it was a state charge, but he also read the word "expunged" and decided he did not have to list it (R. 17, 39).  He thought maybe there was some linkage between the 
state and federal rules that would have resulted in federal expungement when the state conviction was expunged (R. 40).  Applicant's 2005 SF 86 for Question 24 includes the information about the 
1992 charge of marijuana possession.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> I do not find his statements about believing he did not have to include the information about the 1992 marijuana possession conviction because it was 
expunged to be credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27 of Applicant's 2003 SF 86 asks about his illegal drug activity.  It asks, "Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, 
for example, marijuana . . . ?"<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  He answered, "No." On April 19, 2004, at pages 2-3, Applicant stated during his DSS interview, "I smoked marijuana a total of maybe 6 times only from 
approximately the time I was about 15 years old until 1998/99. . .  I do not recall why I reflected on my security form that I had not used any illegal substance.  I thought I had provided all of the 
required information and had no reason to omit information concerning my past use of marijuana."  Applicant's statement in his DSS interview is specific, and it was made when he did not have a 
motive to fabricate.  Accordingly, I find his 2004 DSS statement to be more credible than his 2005 response to the SOR and his 2006 testimony at the hearing that his marijuana use ended more than 
seven years before he completed his 2003 SF 86. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he made his 2004 statement to the DSS special agent, he read each page, initialed each page, and signed it (R. 42-43).  The DSS special agent confronted Applicant with his arrests in 1992 
and 1999, and then he admitted them (R. 49-51).  The DSS special agent gained rapport with Applicant by acting like he was Applicant's friend (R. 43).  They discussing fishing.  The DSS special 
agent used his relationship with Applicant's stepfather to gain his trust (R. 51-52).  Then he caught Applicant off guard and Applicant admitted  marijuana use within the 7-year time limit in 
Question 27 (R. 52).  At his 2006 security clearance hearing, he said he was either confused about what he was doing and was off by a year or so when he filled out his SF 86, or as he filled out his 
SF 86 he answered "no" because the year of his last drug use was 1996 (R. 18-19).  He attributed the placement of the erroneous date in the DSS  statement to its being authored by the DSS agent, 
rather than by himself (R. 18, 27).  He was adamant that his most recent marijuana use was outside the 7-year time limit (at least 1996 or before) (R. 52).  As indicated previously, I do not find his 
2006 statement at his hearing about his most recent marijuana use to be credible.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For Question 27 of Applicant's 2005 SF 86, he answered, "No."<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> At his hearing on November 2, 2006, Applicant insisted his 2005 SF 86 was accurate (R. 45).  The SOR does not allege that he 
falsified his 2005 SF 86.  I draw no adverse inference against Applicant based on his response to Question 27 on his 2005 SF 86. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contended his employer caused his mistaken answers on his 2003 SF 86 by rushing him to complete it (R. 26, 45-46).  He conceded his employer did not provide advice to him on how to 
answer the questions (R. 45).  He did not receive advice from anyone about the security implications of the expungement of his 1992 marijuana possession conviction (R. 46).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several character references indicated Applicant was very helpful, responsive and diligent in his information technology assistance to the Department of Defense (Exhibit A, at 1-2).  He assisted in 
the recovery of lost data, and provided outstanding customer support (Exhibit A, at 5).  In 2003, his employer lauded his hard work, and provided a pay raise with a promotion (Exhibit A, at 3).  He 
received another pay raise in recognition of his accomplishments in 2004 (Exhibit A, at 6).  Applicant was very interested in obtaining a security clearance, and had made intense efforts to gain his 
clearance ( R. 56-58).     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).</SPAN><A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG>      </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
[applicant] may not properly safeguard classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A security concern 
may result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides "false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.3.  PC DC 5 applies when an applicant has "a pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For PC DCs 2 and 3, </SPAN>Applicant deliberately gave a false answer to Questions 24 and 27 of his 2003 SF 86, in an attempt to conceal the extent of his marijuana possession and use.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence 
of record establishes SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b by substantial evidence because he admited preparing his security questionnaire, he understood the questions, and he deliberately provided answers that 
omitted important information.  His statements of confusion about expungement or whether he was required to list a charge as opposed to a conviction are not credible.  The omitted information 
would have provided the government with material derogatory information.  PC DC 5 does not apply to SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b because the falsification occurred on the same 2003 SF 86.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when 
the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b are 
established by substantial evidence, and constitute deliberate falsifications.  As such SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b are relevant to making a security determination about his judgment, trustworthiness, and 
reliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><A NAME="cp223"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC 2 applies when the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  PC MC 3 
applies when the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  Applicant has partially established PC 
Cs 2 and 3 because only one false SF 86 was submitted to the government on October 29, 2003, over three years ago.  Additionally, he made a belated, good-faith effort to correct the record when 
he admitted the falsification in 2004 to a DSS investigator (albeit after being confronted with the facts).  Although his eventual admission that the clearance entries were false was not "prompt," he 
deserves some credit under the "whole person" concept for providing accurate information in 2004.  </SPAN><EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (indicating when a mitigating

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR </SPAN>&para; 2.a alleges that he violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by falsifying two answers on his 2003 SF 86.  As indicated previously, I find that he deliberately falsified his 2003 SF 86.  For a violation of 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001 to occur, however, the falsification must be material.  The Supreme Court defined "materiality" in <EM>United States v. Gaudin</EM>, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement having a "natural 
tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed."  <EM>See also United States v.

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN>If Applicant had provided accurate answers to Questions 24 and 27 of his SF 86, those accurate answers were capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance.  His  marijuana 
usage until 1998/1999 (from the age of 15 to the age of 25), and his marijuana possession in 2000, were sufficiently recent<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and serious<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> to jeopardize his security clearance application.<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  
Because his marijuana possession and/or use occurred over a decade, and resulted in law enforcement and judicial intervention on two occasions, his omissions to his SF 86 were material.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Security concerns based on criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent (CC MC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.1.  As indicated previously in the discussion of materiality under 
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, there are no "bright line" rules for determining when conduct is "recent."<A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  If the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,"

Applicant's last SOR-alleged incident of criminal conduct was his false statement, when he filled out his security clearance application in 2003.  However, the SOR allegation of criminal conduct 
must be considered along with all the other evidence when applying this mitigating condition.  He was not forthright and candid when addressing his culpability in his response to the SOR, dated 
September 8, 2005, and at his hearing on November 2, 2006.<SUP> </SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-00967.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Viewing his conduct as a whole, CC MC 1 does not apply. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct security concerns may be mitigated under CC MC 2 when the "crime was an isolated incident," Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.2, or under CC MC 3 when an applicant demonstrates he 
"was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life."  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.3.  CC MCs 2 and 3 do not apply because Applicant 
committed the 2003 falsification and then was dishonest in his 2005 response to the SOR and at his 2006 hearing when addressing the falsifications, and no one caused him or influenced him to 
commit the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For CC MC 4, security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct may be mitigated when an applicant "did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to 
recur."  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.4.&nbsp; Applicant voluntarily committed the criminal conduct, and has not shown a sufficient track record of positive or non-criminal conduct.  CC MC 4 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In regard to CC MCs 5 and 6, security concerns may be mitigated when an applicant was acquitted or "[t]here is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.5 and 
E2.A10.1.3.6.  CC MC 5 and 6 do not apply because Applicant was not acquitted of violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 and there is a dearth of evidence about changes in his life that establish his

actions concerning personal and criminal conduct, especially the falsification of his 2003 SF 86 were knowledgeable and voluntary.  E2.2.1.2.<SUP></SUP>  His SOR-alleged falsification pertains to a single SF 
86 in 2003, and would be isolated and not particularly recent, if considered alone.  However, his falsifications in his 2005 response to the SOR, and at his 2006 security clearance hearing are very 
recent.  E2.2.1.3.</SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  He was in his late 20's when he falsified his 2003 SF 86, and he is sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.  E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP>  The falsification was a voluntary decision, 
motivated by a desire to conceal the extent of his marijuana possession and use.  E2.2.1.5 and E2.2.1.7.</SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN>The absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes increases security 
concerns, and the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress remains.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.6 and E2.2.1.8.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  The likelihood of future falsifications remains substantial because such a short period of
