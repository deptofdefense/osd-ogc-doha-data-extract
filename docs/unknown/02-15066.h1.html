</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On April 18, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-15066.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-15066.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 20, 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2003.  On September 17, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend subparagraph 
1.d. of the SOR to show that Applicant had answered 'no" to Question 26 and not Question 21 on her security clearance application (SF-86).  Applicant 
concurred in the proposed amendment and admitted a misdemeanor arrest and conviction and not a felony arrest and conviction.  (Transcript 19-23.)  
Accordingly, I granted Department Counsel's motion.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on September 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR in this case contains 8 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  All 8 allegations related to the falsification of 
material facts on Applicant's SF-86, which she filed on May 23, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted answering Question 36 on the SF-86 incorrectly.  Question 36 reads as follows: "Your Financial Record - Tax 
Lien.  In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 36.  In 
her answer, she admitted the existence of a state tax lien, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a., but denied she knew about it when she filed her SF-86.<A HREF="02-15066.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer, Applicant also admitted answering Question 37 incorrectly.  Question 37 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Record - Unpaid 
Judgments.  In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 37.  Applicant 
admitted she knew of the judgment but stated she was not aware that it was listed on her credit report.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answer also acknowledged that her response to Question 38 on the SF-86 was not truthful.  Question 38 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your 
Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days.  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 38.  She 
admitted that she failed to list 3 debts that she knew were over 180 days delinquent in response to Question 38.  She also admitted a fourth debt in the amount 
of $8,835, relating to the repossession of an automobile, which she knew to be over 180 days overdue when she answered Question 38.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer, Applicant denied answering Question 21 on her SF-86 incorrectly.  Question 21 reads as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Your Police Record - Felony Offenses</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Have you been charged with or convicted of any felony offenses?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.)  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or 
otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which 
the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "no" to Question 21.  In her answer, she explained that she had been arrested, convicted, and fined for bank fraud, a misdemeanor crime.  
At her hearing, Applicant admitted being convicted of the misdemeanor crime in 1995 and also admitted that she had not responded truthfully to Question 26 
on the SF-86, which required an applicant to list any arrests for offenses committed in the last 7 years which were not identified in responses to Questions 21, 
22, 23, 24, or 25 on the SF-86.  Without objection, I granted Department Counsel's request to amend the SOR to show Applicant's falsification of her response 
to Question 26 and not to Question 21.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed for three years as a program management specialist by a government contractor.  She is the single mother of 
one child.  Her financial difficulties date back to the early 1990s.  (Ex. 2, at 1-3.)  She attributes her financial problems to her failure to realize the importance of 
maintaining good credit  (Ex. 2, at 5.)  In an attempt to cure her financial problems, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on November 19, 2001.  (Ex. 2, at 1.)  
She stated that the bankruptcy court granted her petition in bankruptcy and fully discharged her debts in January 2002.<A HREF="02-15066.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted providing untruthful answers on her SF-86, but she denied untruthful intent.  She said she regretted her past behavior, and she stated she did 
not know at the time she filed her security clearance application how important it was to answer the questions on the form fully and truthfully. (Tr. 84-86.)  She 
stated that she had matured and had become a trustworthy person.  (Tr. 87.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, the SOR, as amended, alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in her security clearance application by answering 
"no" to Questions 36, 37, 38, and 26 on her SF-86, thereby deliberately failing to disclose a tax lien (1.a.), an unsatisfied judgment (1.b.), financial 
delinquencies of over 180 days (1.c.), 1.c(1), 1.c(2), 1.c(3), and 1.c(4), and an arrest, conviction, and fine for bank fraud (1.d.).  Conduct involving questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant 
may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant deliberately omits, conceals, or falsifies material facts on a personal security questionnaire, this raises a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. &para; E2.A5.1.2.2.  The security concern resulting from lack of candor or truthfulness in answering the questions on an SF-86 can be mitigated if the 
individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.   &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided negative answers to Questions 36, 37, 38, and 26 when she completed and signed her SF-86 in May 2001.  In her answer to the SOR and in 
her testimony at her hearing, Applicant admitted falsifying her responses to the questions.  I find her falsifications to be deliberate.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Applicant's Guideline E conduct, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's failure to answer Questions 36, 37, 38, and 26 on her 
SF-86 completely, truthfully, and correctly raises a security concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  The record shows that the falsifications were not 
isolated incidents and occurred in recent time.  When confronted with the facts, Applicant voluntarily supplied correct information to an agent of the Defense 
Security Service.  However, she did not make a prompt good faith effort to correct the falsifications before being confronted with the facts.  Thus, mitigating 
condition E2.A5.1.3.3 is inapplicable to the facts of her case.  Accordingly, all Guideline E allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.  Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P>
