<P>Applicant successfully mitigated alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns raised by one assault incident and two driving with his ability

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 8 December 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-31974.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 January 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me on 22 March 2004.  On 14 April 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 27 April 2004.</P> 
 
<P>At the Government's request, and without objection from Applicant, I amended the allegation in SOR &para; 2.a. as follows:</P> 
 
<P>a.  That information set forth in subparagraph <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: line-through">1.a. and </SPAN>1.b.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> and 1.c.</SPAN>, above, which constitutes criminal activity.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 30-year-old associate technology engineer for a defense contractor.  He held a security clearance when he served in the U.S. Air Force from 1995-99.  That clearance was transferred to his civilian employment.  In January 2001, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) for a periodic 
update of his clearance.  His supervisor and the security officer find Applicant to be an honest, dedicated, and reliable employee.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits that, in the past, he consumed alcoholic beverages to excess on a few social occasions.  In December 1996, Applicant was arrested for failing 
to obey a traffic signal; driving without a license, insurance, and vehicle registration; driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI); and driving with impaired 
ability (DWAI).  His blood-alcohol content on that occasion was .10.  He pled guilty to DWAI; the other offenses were dismissed.  He had a driver's licence, 
insurance, and his vehicle was registered-he just did not have proof of such in the vehicle when he was stopped.  He was given a deferred sentence,<A HREF="02-31974.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> fined, 
ordered to perform community service and attend alcohol education awareness classes, and placed on unsupervised probation for 12 months.</P> 
 
<P>On 13 May 1998, Applicant had a heated argument with his girlfriend, who was living with him.  They started to shove each other.  Meanwhile, someone called 
the police.  When the police arrived, the girlfriend showed them red marks on her arms.  The police cited Applicant for third degree assault.  Applicant's 
girlfriend asked that the charges against Applicant be dropped, but the prosecutors refused to do so.  Applicant was convicted of the offense as he was ordered 
to attend 36 weeks of domestic violence education classes, fined, and placed on one year of supervised probation.  The girlfriend, with whom he is no longer 
involved, remains friends with Applicant and accepts responsibility with Applicant for the dispute.  Ex. B.  The couple was still together at the time Applicant 
filed his SCA in January 2001.  Ex. 1 at 3.  Applicant successfully completed the terms of his probation.  </P> 
 
<P>On 18 June 2001, Applicant drove a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  Answer at 2.  Applicant was arrested after he spent all day playing softball and 
drinking alcoholic beverages.  His blood-alcohol level was .124.<A HREF="02-31974.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Ex. 2.  In October 2002, he pled guilty to DWAI.  He was sentenced to 15 days in jail, fined, 
ordered to attend a level II alcohol education program, and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service.  His deferred sentencing hearing is scheduled 
for January 2005.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from 1991 to the present (&para; 1.a.), was convicted of DWAI for an incident in 
June 2001 (&para; 1.b.), and was convicted of DWAI for an incident in December 1996 (&para; 1.c.).  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.c.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of</SPAN> alcohol-related incidents away from 
work-two DWAIs.  Although Applicant also had a history of consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication, he has modified that behavior since his last DWAI 
in 2001.  Applicant's alcohol-related problems appear to be in his past.  The problem occurred a number of years ago-the last incident was over three years ago.  
C E2.A7.1.3.2.  The level II alcohol education program required him to consult with a counselor.  This provided him better insight into his use and previous 
abuse of alcohol.  And Applicant made positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety-he does not drink when he has to drive a vehicle, he limits his 
consumption to one to two drinks, and does not consume alcohol except on special occasions.  Applicant realizes another incident will likely result in his losing 
his security clearance.  MC E2.A7.1.3.3.  After considering all the circumstances, I am convinced Applicant has his drinking under control and does represent a 
security threat.  I find for Applicant on &para; 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has a history of criminal activity involving the two DWAIs and a conviction for third degree assault in 1998.  A history or 
pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the amended &para; 2 of the SOR.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted 
criminal conduct-multiple lesser offenses. DC E2.A10.1.2.1, E2.A10.1.2.2.  But there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  MC E2.A10.1.3.6.  
Applicant has matured.  He is now 30 years old, settled down, married, and has a child.  He no longer drinks alcohol to excess.  There is little likelihood of 
recurrence of Applicant's criminal conduct.  I am convinced he does not represent a security risk.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
