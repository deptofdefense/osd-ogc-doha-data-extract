<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old electrician working for a defense contractor. From approximately 1996 through 2000, he accrued a number of debts. Nearly half of 
those debts have been paid and repayment agreements have been negotiated on all but the largest remaining obligation, which is over twice as large as his other 
debts combined. He also wrote about nine bad checks over a brief period of time, which he redeemed shortly thereafter. Applicant has mitigated concerns about 
his personal conduct. He has failed to mitigate concerns arising from financial considerations by failing to act on his largest debt. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On April 22, 2003, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statements of Reasons (SOR) concluding it was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a four-page answer, dated May 20, 2003, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations. He admitted seven of the 14 allegations raised under Guideline F and denied the two allegations raised under Guideline E. 
Additionally, he waived his right to an administrative hearing in favor of a decision based on the written record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated December 22, 2003. Applicant was provided a complete copy of the FORM, which 
was received on January 11, 2004. On February 26, 2004, Applicant responded to the FORM through a 7-page letter with 11 attachments. Department Counsel 
did not object to the Applicant's submitted materials. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to another administrative judge, then transferred to me on February 18, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answers to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 31-year-old electrician who has worked for the same defense contractor since August 2002. He has worked as an electrician in various capacities 
since 1993. In 1996, he received an associate of science and arts degree. Applicant was married in April 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 1993, Applicant has been continuously employed as an electrician, with the exception of a period of unemployment lasting from approximately January 
1995 through February 1996.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In the summer of 1996, Applicant moved out of the family home and finished college. In November 1997, he deposited an out-of-town check, then wrote approximately nine checks on his account. Those checks were presented before the deposit had cleared his bank, and were returned 
for non-sufficient funds. He settled his debt with seven of the payees. Before the final two were paid, however, two Criminal Summons' for a Simple Worthless 
Check were issued against him on February 10, 1998, in his state's local general court.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> No arrests were made.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He appeared in court on March 9, 1998, and paid 
restitution on the checks, fines, and court costs.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still recovering from his year of unemployment, Applicant's accrued debts eventually became delinquent. That situation continued until 2001, when he stopped 
accruing new debt. He took control of his finances in order to prepare for his impending marriage. Around the time of his April 2002 marriage, however, he left 
one employer for another. The work there proved to be less than full-time and offered limited potential for permanency. He was soon offered a full time 
position, but it required him to move to another state. That summer, the couple prepared to move, and Applicant's wife turned in her notice to her employer in 
July. Once they were moved, Applicant began his current job in August 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are 11 debts at issue in the SOR, plus two entries that are duplicates of debts noted elsewhere. Applicant disputes one of the debts. Those debts are as 
follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In sum, of the 13 entries above: two are duplicate entries, one entry is disputed, five debts have been paid or settled, and repayment or settlement plans for the 
remaining five debts have been initiated, although Applicant failed to provide proof that any payments have been made on these plans. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The final financial concern noted in the SOR is SOR subparagraph 1.n. That subparagraph alleges that Appellant has made little effort to address his debts, 
despite having a net remainder of $737 per month after expenses. Applicant has responded by stating this sum, based on his August 2, 2002, financial 
statement, is misleading inasmuch as it represents the combined income of both himself and his wife for the three month period both were simultaneously 
employed.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Due to relocation expenses and his wife's resultant period of unemployment, their income became significantly reduced shortly after the August 
2002 financial statement was completed. For similar reasons he dismisses the accuracy of the March 28, 2003, credit report as not taking into consideration the 
couple's financial ups and downs. Applicant stresses, however, that he began addressing his debts prior to the initiation of the security clearance process, citing 
to his initial efforts of paying off some of his debts prior to his April 2002 marriage. To fortify his position, Applicant notes the fact he has not had a negative 
bank account balance since 2001, and points to his improved credit reports from March 2003 and February 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,  each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</EM><A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</EM><A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate 
security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). For clarity, I will discuss each separately.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Financial Considerations</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following a period of unemployment lasting over a year in 1995 and 1996, Applicant began accruing debts. This acquisition lasted until 2001, when he was 
able to start maintaining a positive bank balance. Consequently, because of these accrued debts, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Applicant started addressing his acquired debts in 2001. To date, however, at 
least six debts remain unsatisfied, including one which he disputes. Under these facts, neither FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) nor FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By around March 1996, Applicant resumed work after a period of unemployment that lasted over a year. During that time, debts began to mount. Once they had 
started, he never again had a positive bank balance until 2001. Therefore, it appears that his lengthy unemployment started the financial disorder that dogged 
him through 2001, when he returned to maintaining a positive bank balance, if not, to a lesser degree, through the mid-2000s.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Therefore, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 
(<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>)) applies to a limited extent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At no point in the case file is there any evidence that Applicant received financial counseling. In the absence of appropriate and much needed professional 
guidance and fiscal education, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply<EM>.  </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Starting in 2001, Applicant began maintaining a positive balance in his bank account and he started to work on his financial condition. Although there was a 
financial struggle in 2002 with his marriage, his wife's temporary loss of employment, his period of self-employment, and their eventual relocation in July or 
August 2002, he ceased acquiring new debt and, apparently, satisfied some debts. The record clearly documents that he has satisfied 5 of the 11 debts cited in 
the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Remaining are five unpaid debts and the one which Applicant disputes. As of the time of his final submission, there is no evidence that any payments had been 
made on the remaining debts or any action taken regarding the car loan. He has demonstrated good faith inasmuch as he has initiated contact with five of the 
creditors, and either instituted repayment or settlement agreements, or received offers for settlement. There is no evidence, however, that any payments have 
been made on any of the agreements or settlements. The lack of proof of payments is problematic because the existence of an agreement or an offer to settle is 
of little significance if there is no proof the agreement was implemented with an acceptance payment. Therefore, Applicant has not established that FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.6 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies.<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What is troublesome are his current finances. He has paid five of the undisputed debts and sought repayment plans on the remaining debts. He has made no 
proffer, however that the next, most important step has been made: namely, to start making payments on them. Still the amount at issue is a manageable sum, a 
little more than $4,000. By itself, Applicant might therefore be given the benefit of the doubt, given his efforts in securing payment plans. It is the car loan debt, 
however, that is most troubling. Applicant states that he disputes the nearly $10,000 allegedly owed, but has offered no proof that he has attempted to put the 
matter into formal dispute with any of the major credit reporting bureaus, requested an adjustment from the creditor based on the resale of his car after voluntary 
repossession, or otherwise sought to resolve the matter. Until he does so, that amount more than trebles the debt for which he has pursued settlement or 
repayment plans. Consequently, the cumulative amount of the debt is significant and the vast majority of it unaddressed. Therefore, I find that he has failed to 
mitigate financial concerns. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges that Applicant wrote a number of checks in November 1997 that were subsequently returned for non-sufficient funds. He admits this fact, 
noting that the checks were returned because an out-of-town deposit had not cleared the bank before the checks were presented. The SOR further alleges that he 
was twice arrested for writing worthless checks. Applicant, however, has demonstrated that no arrests were made. Rather, summons' were issued on two of the 
checks, for which he went to court and paid restitution. Regardless, the fact remains that a number of worthless checks were written in November 1997 which 
eventually led to his being summoned to court on two of those checks. Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.4 
([<EM>p</EM>]<EM>ersonal</EM> <EM>conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such as engaging in 
activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>) applies.<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The majority of Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) presuppose the falsification, omission, or withholding of information, and are, therefore, 
inapplicable. Here, Applicant prematurely wrote checks before a deposited out-of-town check had cleared. As a consequence, the checks were returned for non-sufficient funds. At the time, Applicant was one year out of school and out from his parents home, living independently. He was young and inexperienced with 
finance and banking. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between December 1997 and January 1998, Applicant redeemed all but 2 of the 9 checks The remaining two obligations were satisfied in court as a matter of 
public record in February 1998. When Applicant completed his September 2002 security clearance application, he properly noted the worthless check offenses 
on Question 26 ("Your Police Record - Other Offenses").<A HREF="02-31625.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Because he satisfied the debts at issue and because he has been candid about an incident that is 
already a matter of public record, his youthful financial na&iuml;vet&eacute; and unconcealed conduct should not be held against him nearly a decade later. PC MC 
E2.A5.1.3.5 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the "whole person" concept. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a young, married man with an associate's 
degree. Not long after finishing college, he wrote a number of checks against an out-of-town deposit that had not yet cleared. Subsequently, the checks were 
properly redeemed. Given his age and inexperience, this may be viewed as a learning experience; indeed, there is no evidence that he has written any bad 
checks since. Therefore, I find that personal conduct concerns have been mitigated to the extent they arise from the 1997 returned checks. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taken together, Applicant has mitigated concerns arising from an incident from his past that bears little weight on his character today. He has made 
commendable efforts toward his current debts. He has failed, however, to equally exert any demonstrable effort toward negotiating, settling, repaying, or even 
addressing his largest debt. Until all of his debts have at least been addressed and brought under control, security concerns linger, both as to his financial 
stability and his judgment. Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P>
