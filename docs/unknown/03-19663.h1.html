<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 21 July 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of criminal conduct.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 4 August 2004 requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 5 November 
2004 and I scheduled a hearing for 15 December 2004. On 14 December 2004 Department Counsel moved to continue the case pending resolution of the

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 14 December 2004, this case became subject to a moratorium on all cases involving application of 18 U.S.C. 986 pending receipt of implementing guidance 
for statutory changes made in October 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The background of the statutory changes to 18 U.S.C. 986 and affecting such cases may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>. The memorandum provided policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precluded the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances. The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to 
classified information and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act 21 U.S.C. 802);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicated that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved and adopted, amending 
portions of Subsection (c)(1) of section 986 of Title 10, United States Code, thereby altering it to read as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, <EM>and was incarcerated as a 
result of that sentence for not less than one year.</EM> (Emphasis of change supplied)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 14 December 2004, a moratorium was established on all cases involving 10 USC 986, including cases that would have been covered by the statute prior to 
its revision the month earlier. The moratorium was lifted on 3 August 2005. I was subsequently advised by Department Counsel that the SOR in this case would 
not be withdrawn as a result of the statutory changes, and I scheduled the case for hearing.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He is a 45-year-old company 
president seeking access to classified information. He had not previously held a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the mid 1980s, Applicant had three drug-related criminal encounters with police. In October 1986, he was charged with possessing cocaine because  he was 
holding a friend's cocaine when the police stopped them. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 28 days in jail, suspended, and five years probation. In July 1988, 
Applicant was charged with possessing cocaine when the drug was found in his car after a traffic stop for speeding. The charges were dropped when one of 
Applicant's passengers later admitted that the cocaine belonged to him. In August 1988, Applicant was charged with dispensing cocaine and possession with 
intent to dispense cocaine. He had been selling cocaine for a friend. He later pled guilty and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, seven years suspended, and 
three years of supervised probation. He ultimately served 15 months in prison.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His arrest for selling cocaine served as a wake-up call for Applicant. He realized the adverse consequences of associating with the friends he had chosen. While 
he was pending trial, he moved in with the pastor of his church and the pastor's wife. His pastor was an advocate of "tough love" and confronted Applicant 
about his poor life choices and the consequences of those choices. Applicant experienced a religious conversion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed his prison sentence without incident, and completed the requirements of his probation. He married while he was in prison and took 
classes. When he was released from prison, he worked a number of menial jobs to support his family until he could find work in his field. He and his wife have 
three children, ages 14, 12, and 6. He has no criminal conduct since August 1988.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's partner<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and his pastor testified credibly about the positive changes in Applicant since his August 1988 arrest and his transformation to being a good 
father and solid citizen. His work references (AE A) attest to his exemplary work record and his academic and technical achievements since leaving prison.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline J case by demonstrating that Applicant was convicted of dispensing cocaine and possessing cocaine with intent to 
dispense, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and served 15 months. Nevertheless, I would ordinarily find the conduct mitigated. Applicant's three crimes 
occurred within a two-year period over 17 years ago. Applicant had no criminal conduct before these incidents and no criminal conduct since.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's 
character references and his work record demonstrate the extent to which he has transformed his life since his arrest.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unfortunately, Applicant's criminal conduct cannot be mitigated under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, even as amended. The statute requires that I not grant Applicant's 
clearance because he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and served a total of 15 months in prison.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Having denied Applicant's clearance solely because of the requirements of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, OI 64 requires me to make a recommendation--without 
explanation--whether this case should be considered for meritorious waiver.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> OI 64 implements the requirements of the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
emorandum of 7 June 2001.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> However, the Appeal Board has recently ruled that administrative judges lack the legal authority to make the required 
recommendation under the amendments to the waiver language in the statute.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Appeal Board  equates a recommendation for waiver by the Administrative 
Judge with a decision by the Secretary concerned to grant a waiver and it presumes that no appropriate guidance exists for processing waiver requests. 
Nevertheless, the amended waiver language<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not void--expressly or by implication--the requirements of OI 64, which are ministerial only. Nor does it 
void the procedural requirements of the 7 June 2001 Memorandum.<A HREF="03-19663.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The administrative judge is not the waiver authority under either version of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 
986, and the waiver authority is not bound in any fashion to follow the recommendation. Further, the required recommendation is made without explanation, 
and thus without reference to any factors, whether mandated by implementing guidance or instructions to the original statute or later mandated in compliance 
with the new statutory language. Consequently, any waiver recommendation made in compliance with OI 64 complies with the plain language of the amended 
waiver provision. Alternatively, any error in making the required recommendation is, at worst, harmless error. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that I may note my recommendation 
as directed by the waiver authority without prejudicing Applicant's case. Recognizing my recommendation is not binding on the waiver authority, I recommend 
further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
