<P>Applicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns raised by her missing one of her Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments, having a delinquent $517 
account in collection, and having greater monthly expenses than income. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 7 July 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-14832.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 19 August 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 21 
arch 2005. On 16 June 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 23 June 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old product technician for a defense contractor. She has worked for the defense contractor for over 20 years and has held a security 
clearance since 1990. She is divorced and has two adult children. Applicant's daughter and two children live with her and are dependent upon her for a place to 
live and at times for their financial livelihood as her daughter has had trouble finding and holding full-time employment. Applicant's supervisor reports she is a 
dedicated, trustworthy, and productive member of his staff.</P> 
<P>Applicant's financial problems started after she was in an automobile accident in October 1998. Although she was taken to the hospital, she was not injured 
seriously. Her mother and grandson were also injured in the accident and Applicant had to take time off from work to care for them. Ex. 2 at 1-2. As a result of 
her accident, Applicant was forced to replace her vehicle. She purchased a 1984 vehicle, but it has been plagued with problems that have cost her a lot of money 
to fix. </P> 
<P>In 1999, Applicant's employer sent her out of state for training for six months. She returned home every other weekend. The cost of her stay out of state and the 
travel back and forth to her home exceeded what she was paid by her employer by $3,000. The extra amount was deducted from her paycheck which caused her 
to have difficulty paying some other bills. In 1999, Applicant sought financial counseling. She got rid of her credit cards and filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 
2001. Applicant has been late on her bankruptcy only once and she is now current. The bankruptcy payments should be complete in August 2006. She is now 
three months behind in her mortgage payments-approximately $2,500. Tr. 24.</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges one delinquent debt-an account for $517 placed for collection in April 2002. Applicant claims she paid the debt. Although she was unable to 
provide any corroboration of that fact (Tr. 22-23), the debt no longer appears on her credit report. Ex. 5. Her latest personal financial statement, submitted at the 
hearing, shows her income exceeds her expenses by approximately $100 each month. Ex. 3 at 6. She also has an unpaid cell phone bill, that was run up by her 
daughter, in the amount of $2,067. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and she missed at least one of her payments to the trustee (&para; 1.a); has a delinquent 
account that was placed for collection (&para; 1.b); and has a monthly negative income balance of over $250 per month (&para; 1.c). In her Answer, Applicant admitted 
each of the allegations. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate fund's.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a history 
of not meeting her financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable to satisfy her debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.2). However, her financial problems are, in part, the 
result of conditions beyond her control-her automobile accident, being off the job for a month to care for her mother and grandson, and having to purchase 
another vehicle that has required many costly repairs. MC E2.A6.1.3.3. After listening carefully to her testimony and observing her demeanor, I find credible 
her testimony that she paid the $517 debt alleged in &para; 1.b. Although she missed one payment on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she is now current and has only 13 
of the 60 payments remaining.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's main problem was her negative cash flow-according to her personal financial statement, she incurred expenses totaling $250 more than her 
monthly income. Ex. Ex. 3 at 6. At the hearing, Applicant reports her income now exceeds her expenses by $100. Applicant understands she must continue to 
make her payments and remain solvent. She needs to get current on her mortgage and resolve her delinquent cell phone account. She recognizes that failing to 
do so may prevent her from continuing to hold a security clearance and may result in her reassignment or the loss of her job. She will be in somewhat better 
shape when she completes paying on her bankruptcy in 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but are predictive judgments about a applicant's security eligibility in light of her past conduct and present 
circumstances." ISCR Case No. 03-04927, 2005 WL 1382028 (App. Bd. Mar. 2005). Applicant has had some financial difficulties for a number of years, but 
these problems have involved relatively minor amounts of money. Although she has struggled at times, she has managed to stay afloat. It is clear that she is 
making good faith efforts to try to resolve these debts. She has held a clearance for 15 years and is a trustworthy and dependable employee. Although the 
previous decisions to grant her a clearance do not giver her any vested interest or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">right in continuing to have a security clearance, her dedication and past history 
is certainly relevant to any decision on her current circumstances. After considering all of the evidence, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and the 
adjudicative process factors, I find for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
