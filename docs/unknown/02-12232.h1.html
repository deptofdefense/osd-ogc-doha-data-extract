<P>Forty-seven-year old Applicant's 1975 arrest for possession of several controlled substances, when he was 19-years old, and his subsequent conviction, 
following a plea agreement, led to a sentence of imprisonment for two years, suspended.  The absence of any subsequent criminal conduct would normally

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written statement, dated May 13, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on August 5, 2003.  A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.  Any such submissions were due by September 19, 2003, and it appears he chose not to do so.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge 
on October 3, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct under Guideline J.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to retain a SECRET security clearance held since 1993.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was involved in two criminal incidents which occurred within six months of each other approximately 28 years ago.  In March 1975, when he was 
19-years-old, Applicant was arrested and charged with buying drugs and possession of a controlled and dangerous substance.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He was subsequently convicted 
and sentenced to six months probation.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Six months later, in October 1975, he was again arrested, and this time charged with possession of several controlled 
substances.  Those substances were marijuana, amphetamines, Demerol&reg;, and Placidyl&reg;.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The FBI Identification Record notes one of the charges was 
actually possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant disputed the allegations against him contending the drugs were placed in his automobile 
by a person or persons unknown to him, followed by a tip to the police.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, because he felt he would be unable to prove the drugs were not his, and 
upon the advice of his attorney to stay out of jail, Applicant entered into a plea agreement.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  On March 17, 1976, he was convicted and sentenced to two years 
in prison, suspended.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant had been poly-substance abuser during the period from October 1973 until his arrest in October 1975.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He has admitted using marijuana on about 
50 occasions and amphetamines about 20 occasions during that two year period.  There is no evidence to indicate continued or recurring substance abuse after 
October 1975.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not undergone any substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>Since his October 1975 arrest, Applicant has avoided any incidents with the authorities, other than three traffic citations.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He was married in 1977, and 
received a BS degree after completing three and one half years of college.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been employed by the same company since September 1989.  The quality of his performance has not been developed in the record.</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</P> 
 
<P>(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</P> 
 
<P>(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</P> 
 
<P>(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</P> 
 
<P>(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</P> 
 
<P>The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</P> 
 
<P>Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the Government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline J, the government has established its case.  By his own admission, Applicant was a poly-substance abuser who, when he was 19-years-old, was arrested and charged with possession of a variety of controlled substances.  Those substances included the following: Demerol&reg; is the trade 
name for meperidine hydrochloride, "a narcotic analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine."<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Placidyl&reg; is the trade name for 
ethchorvynol, an oral hypnotic subject to control by the Federal Controlled Substances Act under DEA Schedule IV.<A HREF="02-12232.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  After entering into a plea agreement, he 
was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended. Applicant's criminal conduct in this regard clearly falls within Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 
(DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>), DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>), and DC E2.A10.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It has been approximately 28 years since the criminal conduct of late 1975.  Since that time, Applicant has not been involved in any additional criminal conduct 
and has apparently abstained from further substance abuse.  Those facts would seem to activate Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. 
(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">by virtue of his spotless record since the arrest, excluding three traffic citations, as well as his abstinence, 
there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, despite not having undergone substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation, thus activating MC E2.A10.1.3.6. 
(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).  In addition, his subsequent maturity and involvement in educational, family, and professional activities, 
seem to have eliminated the otherwise undeveloped motivating factors leading to his illegal substance abuse which </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">are not likely to recur, activating MC 
E2.A10.1.3.4. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, especially the indiscretions of his early adulthood, when there is a clear 
indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation.  Under other circumstances, I might conclude Applicant had, through evidence of extenuation and 
explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case, and the allegation of the SOR would be concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, Applicant's criminal conduct in this regard also falls within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He was convicted in a state court of a crime and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term of two years, suspended--a term which obviously exceeds the one year period envisioned in the law. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Furthermore, as noted above, the 
implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates such a sentence would disqualify persons with "sentences imposed of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>more than </EM>one year, 
regardless of the amount of time actually served.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  In this instance, Applicant was fortunate enough to have his prison term suspended rather than actually served, 
but that fact does not help him in this issue.  Consequently, by virtue of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.  
Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR, are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this instance, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
