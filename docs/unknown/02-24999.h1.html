<P>Applicant's exercise of dual citizenship, including possession of an expired foreign passport, with no desire to renounce his dual citizenship, has not been

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 5, 2003, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned 
to the undersigned on January 29, 2004, and a notice of hearing was issued on February 3, 2004, setting the hearing for March 2, 2004.  At the hearing the 
Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented four exhibits, and testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 
23, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, clarifying "the application of Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  The Applicant received a 
copy of this memorandum.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and testimony presented at the hearing.  The Applicant is 47 years of 
age and has a Doctorate in Physics.  He is employed as an Engineer by a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with  employment in 
the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he has acted 
in such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.  He was born in the United Kingdom in 1956, to parents who were citizens of the 
United Kingdom.  The Applicant grew up and obtained his education in the United Kingdom.  After finishing his doctorate degree, in 1986, he moved to South 
Africa and worked there.  In 1991, he returned to the United Kingdom and began working for a British aerospace company where he held a NATO security 
clearance.  In 1990, the Applicant's British company transferred him to the United States where he worked for several years before returning to the United 
Kingdom in1993.  The Applicant continued to work for the British aerospace company in Britain until 1997.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits C).  In 1997, he moved 
to the United States and joined a defense contractor with whom he has since been employed.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service dated May 14, 2002, the Applicant stated that he possessed a United Kingdom passport 
that was issued to him on February 23, 1994.  The foreign passport expired on February 23, 2004.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  The Applicant 
indicated that he would probably renew the passport for employment purposes in order to obtain employment in the European Union if he is ever laid off in the 
United States.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit  3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was granted his United States citizenship in 2000.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits E and D).  In 2002, after becoming a United States citizen, the 
Applicant used his foreign passport to enter France for convenience purposes.  He also used it to enter Britain in 2003.  The Applicant stated that the foreign 
passport allows him free crossing of all of the borders of the European Union and access to British health care.  (Tr. p. 38).  He has two pensions in the United 
Kingdom, one that is worth approximately $20,000.00.  (Tr. p. 34).  The Applicant's parents and other extended family members and friends reside in the 
United Kingdom.  His wife is also a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that he has not renewed his foreign passport and has no intent to renew it unless he is laid off and needs to seek employment in the 
European Union.  He does not see a conflict with maintaining his dual citizenship status. If his security clearance was not impacted by his foreign passport, he 
would renew his European passport for convenience purposes.  (Tr. p 42).  Furthermore, if he ever needs to live in Europe for more than 90 days he will renew 
it, as his parents, who live in Britain are elderly and frail.  (Tr. p. 43).  He has no desire to renounce his dual citizenship.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 45).  The Applicant is 
aware of the Money Memorandum and its provisions.  (Tr. p. 47).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the 
United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by 
all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the 
record, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts 
have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.  Therefore, disqualifying condition 1, "the exercise of dual citizenship" applies.  
He has indicated that he wants to maintain his foreign citizenship, in order to be able to obtain employment in the European Union if he is ever laid off in the 
United States.  He presently possesses an expired British passport.  The Applicant has failed to comply with the provisions of the Money Memorandum that 
requires dual citizens to surrender their foreign passports to be eligible for access to classified information.  I find that the Applicant has not surrendered his 
foreign passport.  Therefore, disqualifying condition 2, "possession and or use of a foreign passport" also applies.  Thus, he has not demonstrated an 
unequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find against the Applicant under Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
