<P>Applicant used marijuana from 1996 to December 2000, including after he had been granted an interim security clearance. He failed to disclose the marijuana 
use in a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) he signed on October 18, 2000, and thereafter provided false information in statements he made during the 
course of his security clearance investigation. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern that arises from his personal conduct in providing a false 
answer in the SF 86 and during his interviews. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct, Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline H for drug involvement. 
Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on February 13, 2004, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on October 29, 2004, scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, and called three witnesses to testify on his behalf. The transcript was received on November 
24, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 29 years old, has been married since November 2000, and has a three-year-old child. Applicant graduated from high school in 1993, and attended 
college from August 1993 to December 1995. He held numerous jobs for relatively short periods of time between 1995 and 2000, primarily as a pizza cook or 
pizza delivery driver, interspersed with periods of unemployment that generally continued for several months. He enlisted in the Navy in March 1997, but was 
discharged after two weeks because of health problems. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was initially hired by his present defense contractor employer in late 2000, and was granted an interim security clearance on October 19, 2000. 
However, he was refused immediate employment after he failed a pre-employment drug test in November 2000. He was allowed to reapply  six months later, 
and has been employed by that defense contractor since. The testimony of his character witnesses, who are his work supervisors, establishes Applicant has done 
extremely well in this employment and is considered to be an excellent employee. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "No" to question 27 in the Security Clearance Application (SF 86) he signed on October 18, 2000. That question asked: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Use of Illegal 
Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs - Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled 
substance, for example marijuana . . . ?</EM> While answering that question in the negative, Applicant disclosed an arrest for "simple possession" and 
"paraphornalia" [sic] in response to question 24 which inquired about his police record dealing with alcohol/drug offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on August 1, 1998, and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He explained the arrest occurred 
after a car he was riding in was stopped for a traffic offense. The police officer was granted permission to search the vehicle, and discovered about one gram of 
marijuana and a pipe used for smoking marijuana in Applicant's suitcase. Applicant was convicted of both offenses and fined $750.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was questioned about his use of marijuana by contract investigators working on behalf of the Defense Security Service and provided sworn 
statements on May 31, 2002 and June 25, 2002. In the May statement he claimed he began smoking marijuana in 1996, used about a quarter pound of marijuana 
per month, and quit smoking marijuana shortly after being released from jail following his 1998 arrest. In the June statement he reaffirmed that he had not 
consumed marijuana since August 1998. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a sworn statement to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service on June 30, 2003. In that statement he admitted using marijuana from 
1996 until December 2000. He stated he considered himself to have been a heavy user of the drug, he had smoked on average one-half ounce of marijuana, and 
he spent between $40.00 and $50.00 per month purchasing the drug. As to the incorrect answer in the SF 86 he submitted, Applicant indicated he filled out a 
security clearance application in which he answered the question correctly, and provided the form to his employer's security office. He then went on to state: "I 
was informed by the Security Officer that it would be in my best interest to change my Yes response to drug use to a No response. I did not consent to the 
change but it was obviously performed."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his answer to the SOR and during his testimony, Applicant admitted, contrary to his claim in the June 2003 statement that the answer was changed without 
his permission, that he was the person who provided the false answer. However, he does maintain he made the change at the suggestion of his employer's 
security officer.    </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,  Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline H, pertaining to drug involvement, with their respective DC and MC, 
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-24141.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a false answer to question 27 in the SF 86 he submitted, and false information to DSS investigators in statements he provided in May and 
June 2002. His failures to disclose his marijuana use in the SF 86, and his continued use of the drug following his August 1998 arrest, severely undermine the 
ability to place trust and confidence in him at the present time. The false answers and information raise significant security concerns.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading 
information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination </EM>apply in this case. I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline E and find none apply. Guideline E is decided 
against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SF 86 and sworn statements Applicant submitted, each of which contained deliberate falsifications, fall within the criminal prohibition against making false 
statements imposed by Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the testimony of Applicant's character witnesses, his excellent work performance, changed family circumstances, and the sincere expression of 
remorse and regret he expressed at the hearing, I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM> and MC 6: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern, and Guideline J is decided for 
Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. 
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant purchased and used marijuana from 1996 until 2000, including for a short period of time after he executed an SF 86 and was granted an interim 
security clearance. He was also convicted of possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia in 1998. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse</EM>: and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Illegal drug 
possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution </EM>apply in this case. MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>; and 
C 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future </EM>also apply. Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by his use of marijuana, and 
Guideline H is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
