<P>Based on purported admissions Applicant made to a polygrapher, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals declined to grant Applicant a clearance on 
grounds of sexual behavior and personal conduct. The statement of reasons alleged Applicant downloaded pornographic images of children to his home 
computer and deliberately falsified material facts about this conduct in a statement to a Defense Security Service agent. Applicant mitigated sexual behavior and 
personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is an employee of a defense contractor holding contracts with the National Security Agency (NSA). Applicant held a top secret clearance and applied 
for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI).<A HREF="02-12199.h3.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He was required to take a polygraph concerning possible counter-intelligence activities and his 
lifestyle. Thereafter, NSA denied Applicant access to SCI, based on his involvement with child pornography.  Exs. 2d, 2e, 2f. NSA's action triggered a review 
of Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. On 17 July 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR),<A HREF="02-12199.h3.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision that Applicant's security clearance should not be continued-security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual 
Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in an undated writing  and elected to have a hearing before an 
administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 27 October 2003.  On 18 December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 2 January 2003. On 29 
January 2004, I issued a decision granting Applicant a clearance.  The Government appealed. The Appeal Board remanded the case to me on 7 October 2004. I 
issued a remand decision on 3 January 2005. The Appeal Board remanded on 8 August 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant, a 37-year-old network engineer, is married and has two children. Tr. 51-54. He has had a top secret clearance since 1995. Tr. 53. He is viewed by his 
father-in-law, his superiors, and co-workers as a superior performer who is honest and trustworthy.</P> 
<P>As an employee of a defense contractor for the NSA, Applicant applied for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). As part of an investigation for 
SCI access, Applicant was required to take a polygraph examination. During the suitability (also known as lifestyle) portion of the exam, the polygrapher noted 
an anomaly in the polygraph response to Applicant's denial of criminal conduct. Tr. 132. When Applicant was unsure what the problem could be, the 
polygrapher listed a number of different criminal offenses, one of which was child pornography. At the hearing, Applicant admitted telling the polygrapher that 
he "may have downloaded some child pornography" from the Internet. Tr. 133. Applicant told the polygrapher that, between 1995 and 2000, he had 
downloaded pictures of naked women from the Internet and some of these pictures were of naked children. The polygrapher asked whether it involved more or 
less than 1,000 pictures. Applicant replied, "Approximately 1,000." Tr. 134.</P> 
<P>On 20 February 2002, Applicant completed a signed, sworn statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in which he clarified his activities in 
downloading images on his personal computer. Ex.4. Applicant claimed he downloaded well over 1,000 pictures of which approximately 20 happened to be of 
naked children. He asserted he had never actively searched for child pornography, had not engaged in any activity or behavior involving child pornography, was 
not interested in the images of naked children, and immediately deleted the images of nude children from his computer. <EM>Id.</EM> at 2. His wife, his family, and his 
employer are now aware of the allegations against him and the conduct that led to the SOR.</P> 
<P>Applicant consulted a licensed psychologist before the hearing. The consultation consisted of six hours of clinical interview plus various psychological testing. 
The psychologist concluded Applicant did not have a personality disorder, but his "profile indicates that he is highly vulnerable to manipulation by authority 
due to a strong, even inordinate desire to please others and meet their expectations." Ex. F at 4.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">THE HEARING AND DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant objected to the admission of four government exhibits:</P> 
<P>Ex. 2c for identification A document, labeled "Report," dated 16 November 2000, purportedly written by an NSA polygrapher who interviewed Applicant. The 
report is unsigned and the name of the polygrapher does not appear on the document.  </P> 
<P>Ex. 2d for identification Clearance decision statement from NSA's Office of Security, denying Applicant access to SCI, dated 11 July 2001.</P> 
<P>Ex. 2g for identification NSA's First Appeal Review of the denial of Applicant's access to SCI, dated 3 October 2001.</P> 
<P>Ex. 2i for identification NSA's Access Appeals Panel's decision, dated 24 January 2002, sustaining the denial of his access to SCI.</P> 
<P>Ex. 2c for identification states Applicant admitted purposely searching for child pornography 500 times on his home computer and downloading no more than 
1,000 pornographic images of girls between 4 and 17 years of age in non-suggestive poses. At the hearing, Applicant asserted Ex. 2c for identification was not 
an accurate summary of the interview.  He claimed he downloaded images of naked adult women and that he immediately deleted the approximately 20 images 
of naked children that were included. He objected to Ex. 2c for identification on two grounds. First, that the Government refused to produce or even identify the 
polygrapher so Applicant could exercise his right to cross-examination. Tr. 11 (citing Ex. Or. 10865 &sect; 4); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.22. Applicant also argued Ex. 2c 
for identification was a report of investigation that could not be received without an authenticating witness. <EM>Id.</EM>; <EM>see</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.20. Department Counsel 
argued the polygrapher's statement was not a report of investigation (Tr. 16) and it was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Fed. R. Evid. 
803(6), 803(8), and 807 regardless of the availability of the witness.</P> 
<P>I determined Ex. 2c for identification was a written statement adverse to Applicant relating to a controverted issue under Ex. Ord. 10865 &sect; 4 and Directive &para; 
E3.1.22, and was therefore not admissible without affording Applicant an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant unless the head of the agency supplying 
the statement or the General Counsel of the Department of Defense provided special certification concerning the availability of the declarant. I offered 
Department Counsel a continuance so he could seek such certification. After consultation with the Chief Department Counsel, he declined the offer.  I sustained 
Applicant's objection to Ex. 2c.</P> 
<P>Applicant's main objection to Exs. 2d, 2g, and 2i for identification was that they were decisions of NSA security official concerning Applicant's access to SCI 
that were based entirely on Ex. 2c for identification. Ex. 10. I admitted Exs. 2d, 2g, and 2i, for the limited purpose of establishing that NSA had denied 
Applicant access to SCI and the basis of that denial. I did not admit the documents as substantive evidence that Applicant committed the allegations described 
in the SOR. </P> 
<P>In a decision dated 29 January 2004, I granted Applicant a clearance because the Government failed to establish facts that would disqualify Applicant from a 
security clearance. Department Counsel appealed. The Appeal Board remanded on 7 October 2004. On 3 January 2005, I issued another decision. Department 
Counsel appealed and the Appeal Board again remanded on 8 August 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">THE REMANDS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Ex. 2c for Identification</STRONG></P> 
<P>In the original remand, the Appeal Board sustained my conclusion that the Government had failed to establish the necessary predicate for admission of Ex. 2c 
for identification as a written statement adverse to the applicant relating to a controverted issue under Directive &para; E3.1.22. The Government had failed to 
produce the witness or to meet the special certification requirements that would permit the document's admission without the witness. But the Board concluded 
Ex. 2c for identification was a "report of investigation" and ordered me to consider its admissibility under Directive &para; E3.1.20. ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 6, 
10 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).<A HREF="02-12199.h3.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> A report of investigation is admissible"with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules 
of Evidence." Directive &para; E3.1.20. </P> 
<P>The Board authorized me to reopen the record, on a showing of good cause, to accept the testimony of an authenticating witness. The Government asked to 
reopen the record to offer an affidavit from the records custodian of the document, but failed to suggest any basis upon which I could find good cause. I 
concluded the Government had not shown good cause, denied the Government motion to reopen, and ruled Ex. 2c for identification was not admissible. The 
Appeal Board sustained this decision. ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005).</P> 
<P><STRONG>Exs. 2d, 2g, 2i for Identification</STRONG></P> 
<P>Exs. 2d, 2g, and 2i for identification are not written statements adverse to the applicant on a controverted issue. Instead, they are the decisions of various 
security officials at NSA on Applicant's request for access to SCI. But Ex. 2d for identification, the initial NSA SCI clearance decision statement, does contain 
substantial excerpts from Ex. 2c for identification, the polygrapher's inadmissible summary of his interview with Applicant. At the hearing, I admitted Exs. 2d, 
2g, and 2i for identification for the limited purpose of establishing that NSA had denied Applicant access to SCI and the basis for its decision. In its first 
remand, the Appeal Board ordered me to consider the admissibility of these three documents under Directive &para;&para; E3.1.20 and E3.1.22. The Board agreed that 
these three documents are not reports of investigation, so the Government would not have to present an authenticating witness to establish their admissibility 
under &para; E3.1.20. ISCR Case No. 02-12199 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).</P> 
<P>In my first remand decision, I concluded the three documents are not adverse statements on controverted issues, so Directive &para; E3.1.22 does not apply. I 
reaffirmed my ruling that these documents are admissible under Directive &para; E3.1.20 for the limited purpose of establishing that NSA had denied Applicant 
access to SCI and the basis for its decision. I held that the documents were based on hearsay-the polygrapher's adverse written statement. By refusing to 
disclose the polygrapher's identity, the Government precluded Applicant from impeaching him. <EM>See</EM> Fed. R. Evid. 806 (a hearsay declarant may be attacked by 
any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness). Thus, there is no way to determine the reliability of the 
person making the adverse statement, whether the report was composed by the person who conducted the interview with Applicant, or even whether the 
statement was made contemporaneously with the interview.</P> 
<P>In its second remand, the Appeal Board held that I erred by admitting Exs. 2d, 2g, and 2i for a limited purpose without "good reason," and that I inappropriately 
placed a burden on the Government to show reliability of the documents. The Board insists the documents were substantively admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 
803(8). That rule provides that, in civil actions, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law are not excluded by 
the hearsay rule, "<EM>unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.</EM>" Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(C) (emphasis added).</P> 
<P>All three of the documents in question rely on the polygrapher's summary of his interview with Applicant, Ex. 2c for identification, which I concluded was not 
admissible under Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 4 and Directive &para; E3.1.22. The record established that the source of information on which the three documents were based 
and other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness. <EM>See</EM> Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(C). The source is an unnamed individual. The source's statement was not 
given under oath. Indeed, it was not even signed. Its maker was not subject to cross-examination or even impeachment under Fed. R. Evid. 806. There is no way 
to test the writer's ability to accurately perceive and record what Applicant said. It is not clear whether the statement was made contemporaneously with the 
interview or several hours later or even if the person who made the report was the individual who conducted the interview. Thus, I would conclude the three 
exhibits were not substantively admissible because they are based on evidence that indicates a lack of trustworthiness. Regardless, the Appeal Board ruled that 
the documents are admissible substantively. Therefore I must consider them and weigh them with all other evidence of record.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each

Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D-Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant downloaded up to 1,000 pornographic images of children to his home computer. &para; 1.a. Applicant admitted downloading 
more than 1,000 pornographic images of women, but denied retaining or intentionally downloading any pornographic images of children. An applicant's sexual 
behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation 
or duress, or reflects a lack of judgment or discretion. Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence that Applicant downloaded pornographic images of children to his personal computer consists of three documents: a clearance 
decision statement denying Applicant access to SCI (Ex. 2d) and the decisions of the two appellate authorities affirming that denial (Exs. 2g, 2i). The initial 
NSA clearance decision statement is based on the polygrapher's inadmissible statement of interview with Applicant (Ex. 2c for identification). The clearance 
decision statement's recitation of the conduct involved is as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his 16 November 2000 NSA Security Interview, [Applicant] advised that he downloaded no more than 1,000 child pornographic photographs onto his 
personal computer between 1995 and February or March 2000. He reported that these photographs contained nude females that ranged in age from 4 to 17 years 
old. [Applicant] stated that he purposely searched for and downloaded the child pornography on approximately 500 occasions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The photographs were of juvenile females <EM>in non-suggestive poses</EM>. According to [Applicant], <EM>none of the photos contained any type of sexual activity</EM>. After 
downloading the photos to his computer, he saved the "older looking girls" to his hard drive, and deleted the rest. [Applicant] defined the "older looking girls" 
as about 15 years old. He could not recall if he masturbated while viewing the photos.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February or March 2000, [Applicant] deleted all of the child pornography from his computer because his wife was pregnant and he thought it would be 
wrong to continue to view child pornography. His spouse is not aware of his involvement in child pornography, and he never made copies or sent copies to 
others. [Applicant advised that his computer must be completely degaussed before the photos are completely removed from his hard drive; however, he is 
unaware of how to access the photos after the deletion. [Applicant's] spouse is not aware of his involvement with child pornography.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ex. 2d (emphasis added).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his appeal of the initial NSA decision and in a statement made to the DSS agent (Ex. 4), Applicant denied ever actively searching for images of children. He 
insists he downloaded images of naked women with newsreader software and some of the images contained children. The children were not engaged in sexually 
explicit activities, but were merely children and their families at nudist resorts and beaches. Ex. 2f; Ex. 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On direct examination at the hearing, Applicant asserted he told the polygrapher that he inadvertently downloaded "child pornography" through an automatic 
electronic newsreader while he was actually looking for images of naked women. He claimed that of the 1,000 to 2,000 pictures that were downloaded, only 
about 20 were of naked children and he immediately deleted them. He asserted he was not looking for pictures of children and none of the pictures, whether of 
adult women or children, were of sexually explicit acts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's sexual behavior  may raise disqualifying security concerns when it:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Is of a criminal nature (&para; E2.A4.1.2.1);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Is compulsive, addictive, or symptomatic of a personality disorder (&para; E2.A4.1.2.2);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Causes an applicant to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress (&para; E2.A4.1.2.3); or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) Is of a public nature and/or reflects lack of discretion or judgment (&para;.E2.A4.1.2.4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Of a Criminal Nature:</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The knowing possession or downloading of child pornography is a criminal offense. <EM>See</EM> 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2252 et seq. To amount to child pornography, the images 
must be of actual children engaged in sexually explicit poses or conduct. <EM>See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</EM>, 535 U.S. 234 (2002). The only evidence of 
record is that the images were of naked children who were not engaged in sexually explicit conduct. While Applicant used the term child pornography when 
describing these images, it is clear from the context that he was not referring to children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Under the circumstances, I 
conclude Applicant did not download or possess child pornography as defined in the criminal statutes. Therefore, DC 1 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is Compulsive, Addictive, or Symptomatic of a Personality Disorder</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence Applicant suffers from a compulsion or addiction. In fact, the psychologist who consulted with Applicant for six hours of clinical 
interviews plus various psychological testing opined Applicant did not have a personality disorder. Ex. F. DC 2 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Causes an Applicant to be Vulnerable to Coercion, Exploitation, or Duress</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was obviously embarrassed by his conduct and kept it from his wife. DC 3 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is of a Public Nature and/or Reflects a Lack of Discretion or Judgment</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's behavior was not public in nature; it occurred in the privacy of his own home on his own computer. While denying he purposely downloaded child 
pornography, Applicant admitted his conduct in downloading pictures of naked individuals showed a lack of judgment. The conduct made him vulnerable to 
coercion and exploitation because he did not want his wife or family to know what he had done. DC 4 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Guideline lists several conditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns. Only three of the four listed mitigating conditions are arguably 
applicable to Applicant:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature (&para; E2.A4.1.3.2);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability (&para; E2.A4.1.3.3); and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress (&para; E2.A4.1.3.4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that MC 2, 3, and 4 apply to Applicant's case. The last time he downloaded pictures of naked women and children was in 1999 or 2000, some five 
years ago. There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability. Although he may be vulnerable to manipulation by 
authority, the record established that he is an individual with reasoned judgment who is responsible and emotionally stable. No doubt that is why his top secret 
security clearance was not suspended during the investigation, adjudication, and hearing of this case. As Applicant has told his wife, his family, his employer, 
and his friends he downloaded such images to his computer, it can no longer be used to coerce or exploit him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence concerning Applicant's conduct, including Exs. 2d, 2g, and 2i, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and the 
adjudicative process factors (Directive &para; E2.2.1. I conclude Applicant mitigated any sexual behavior security concerns raised by the alleged conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant (a) deliberately falsified material facts in a sworn statement he submitted to a DSS agent when he claimed he had not 
intentionally searched for child pornography to download on his home computer, and (b) downloaded up to 1,000 pornographic images of children to his home 
computer. Applicant denied both allegations. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to Ex. 2d, Applicant stated he purposely searched for and downloaded child pornography on approximately 500 occasions. In his statement to the 
DSS agent, Ex. 4, Applicant swore he never actively searched for child pornography, was not interested in pictures of naked children, and never engaged in 
other activity involving child pornography. The Government's evidence raised the following potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates or employers (&para; E2.A5.1.2.1);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a security worthiness 
determination (&para; E2.A5.1.2.3); and,</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress (&para; E2.A5.1.2.4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The admission of public records into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rules and without authentication is based on a presumption that public records are 
reliable. <EM>See McCormick On Evidence</EM> &sect;&sect; 315-316 (Edward W. Cleary ed., 3d ed. (West 1984). But Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) specifically provides that such public 
records are not admissible under that provision if "the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness." I would find the source 
of information and the circumstances in this case indicate lack of trustworthiness, and then conclude DC 1 does not apply. By determining Ex. 2d was 
admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8), however, the Appeal Board must have concluded the sources of information and other circumstances did not indicate a 
lack of trustworthiness. Thus, I am constrained to find DC 1 applies. But it is important to determine to what DC 1 applies. The evidence is clear. Applicant did 
not intentionally download or possess images of naked children, and none were engaged in sexually explicit conduct or poses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude Applicant deliberately provided the DSS agent false or misleading information as alleged in SOR &para; 2.b, I would have to find that he intentionally 
searched for child pornography to download to his home computer. I carefully weighed the information in Ex. 2d and compared it to Applicant's statement to 
the DSS agent and his testimony at the hearing. I listened carefully to Applicant's testimony and observed his demeanor closely. I find Applicant's statement 
and his testimony to be credible and persuasive. I conclude Applicant did not deliberately provide false or misleading information to the DSS agent in his 20 
February 2002 signed, sworn statement. DC 3 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's concealment of his conduct from his wife increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. DC 4 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions arguably apply:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The information was unsubstantiated;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) The individual has taken positive steps to eliminate or significantly reduce vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all of the mitigating conditions listed under Guideline E as well as the adjudicative process factors of Directive &para; E2.2.1. Applicant's conduct 
was legal. He did not knowingly download images of naked children and none of those images, whether of adults or children, were engaged in sexually explicit 
acts or poses. Applicant's conduct occurred more than five years ago and has not been repeated since. By telling his wife, family, and company of his conduct, 
Applicant took positive steps to eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. MC 5. Under all the circumstances of this case, I find for Applicant 
on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline D:  FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Pursuant to Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/4, <EM>Personnel Security Standards and Procedures Governing Eligibility for Access to Sensitive 
Compartmented Information (SCI)</EM> (Oct. 13, 1999). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Pursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified,. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Although contained in a report of investigation, the polygrapher's statement is clearly a written "statement adverse to the applicant on a controverted issued." 
If the applicant is not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person making the statement, it may only be considered by the administrative judge if the 
head of the agency supplying the statement or the General Counsel of the Department of Defense certifies good cause not to make the witness available for 
cross-examination. Directive &para; E3.1.22. Neither the head of the agency supplying the statement nor the General Counsel of the Department of Defense made 
such certification.</P> 
<P>There are two types of evidentiary rules. Most are rules of inclusion. The evidence is admissible if certain conditions are met. If a party is unable to meet the 
conditions of that rule of admission, he may offer the evidence under other rules of evidence. The other type of evidentiary rules are rules of exclusion. The 
evidence is not admissible unless the evidence meets certain conditions. If the conditions are not met, the party is not free to offer it under another rule of 
evidence. To do so would defeat the purpose of the rule of exclusion. Directive &para; E3.1.22 is a rule of exclusion. By failing to produce either the witness or the 
special certification of the head of the agency supplying the statement or the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, the administrative judge is 
precluded from considering the adverse statement. The statement cannot then be admitted under the more liberal rules for reports of investigation found in 
Directive &para; E3.1.20. To do so would eviscerate the rule. Every adverse statement on a controverted issue, even if collected from an un-named source, would be 
admissible if placed in a report of investigation. Surely that is not what the drafters intended.</P> 
<P>The rules on the admissibility of statements adverse to the applicant relating to a controverted issue, found in Directive &para; E3.1.22, are based on those found in 
the President's Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 4, 3 C.F.R. 1959-1963 (1960). The executive order was issued after the Supreme Court held that as a matter of due process 
"the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that <EM>he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue</EM>." <EM>Greene v. 
cElroy</EM>, 360 U.S. 474, 496 (1959) (emphasis added). Although Applicant was provided the documents, the Government precluded him from showing the 
statement was untrue by failing to disclose the declarant's identity such that he could be impeached.
