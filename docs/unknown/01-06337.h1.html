<P>In 1995, the Applicant was found guilty of a misdemeanor and sentenced to two years in the Department of Correction which was suspended in lieu of three 
years supervised probation. The incident occurred prior to December 1989, when the Applicant was yet in high school.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 directed a clearance 
must be denied. A waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 is recommended. </P> 
 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 27, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 
16, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 4, 2002.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
January 28, 2002, scheduling the hearing which was held on February 19, 2002. The Government's case consisted of four exhibits (Gov Exs).  The Applicant 
relied on his own testimony, the testimony of one other witness, and eight documents. (App Exs)  The record was held open to allow the Applicant to submit 
additional documents. Following the hearing, a single submission, containing multiple pages, was received.  Department counsel having no objection to its 
admission, the submission was admitted as App Ex I.  A transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received on February 28, 2002.  On March 8, 2002, the Applicant's 
Statement of the Case was received and considered. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges criminal conduct (Guideline J). The SOR alleged in 1994, the Applicant was arrested for child abuse, a felony.  The Applicant denies the 
allegation. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 31-years-old, has worked for a defense contractor since February 2000, and  is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  His work performance is 
outstanding for which he received a special achievement award. (App Ex H)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother ran a day care business from her home.  The Applicant would, at times, be temporarily left to watch the children.  Sometime between 
September 1988 and December 1989, (Gov Ex 4, p.2) when the Applicant was between 18 and 19 years old, he masturbated in front of a child<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> while 
temporarily in charge of the day care, and when the other children were napping. (Gov Ex 2, p. 2)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The Applicant was in high school during this single 
occurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In September 1994, the Applicant was charged with Child Abuse: Custodian, a felony.  The state amended the charge to indecent exposure, a misdemeanor,<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
which, under state law, is not a crime involving moral turpitude.  January 1995, the case proceeded with an agreed Statement of Facts.  After pleading not 
guilty, the Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to two years in the Department of Corrections (suspended in lieu of three years supervised probation), 
fined $255.00, and ordered to receive counseling. (Gov Ex 4)  The Applicant completed all the terms and conditions of his sentence.  In March 1996, the 
Applicant's motion for reconsideration of sentence was granted and the entry of judgment was stayed. In December 1996, his probation was terminated early. 
(App Ex A)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Between August 1994 and August 1996, the Applicant began to receive psychiatric treatment.  (App Exs F, I) According to the court psychiatrist who reviewed 
his treatment, the Applicant "made good use of his psychotherapy." (App Ex I)  Some of the underlying issues related to his indecent exposure included anger, 
loneliness, and significant stress which he channeled through his sexual behavior. (App Ex I) His treatment progressed to the point where the Applicant no 
longer posed a threat of repeating his behavior in the future.  He has taken appropriate steps to reform his behavior. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant grew up in a dysfunctional family with difficult parent/child relationships.  At age 16, he attempted suicide because he was unhappy about his 
relationship with his mother. (App Ex I)  He has worked hard to deal with family issues and move beyond them. (App Ex G)  He is married, a caring, patient 
father with a step child and another child due in September 2002. He believes his most important role is to be a father.  He is a loving, caring person who has 
turned his life around. In 1993, when he met his wife he was working in a low paying warehouse job, living with his parents.  In 1996, they married and he 
worked while she got her degree.  Then he got his degree going to night school first and then full time for the last two years.  Between July 1995 and May 2000, 
the Applicant attended college graduating </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>cum laude </EM>in May 2000, with a Bachelor of Science degree. (App Ex E)  In October 1999, they purchased their home.  
The Applicant spends his time remodeling the house, and getting the baby's room ready.  Within the last 10 years he has gotten himself together both morally 
and spiritually. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) The Concern: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   b.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">c. Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline J, (Criminal Conduct).  Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  In January 1995, the Applicant was found guilty of a single misdemeanor--indecent exposure. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although a misdemeanor, it is still a serious crime and disqualifying condition (DC) b.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.  The Applicant was sentenced to two years in the Department 
of Correction, which was suspended.  Since the sentence included imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, DC c.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The underlying incident leading to the single conviction occurred prior to December 1989--more than 12 years ago at a time the Applicant was still in high 
school.  The Applicant has been arrested only one time.  Mitigating Condition (MC) # a.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and b.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.  The Applicant has taken appropriate steps to reform his 
behavior and preclude a recurrence of his inappropriate conduct. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He attended counseling for two years and, according to the court psychiatrist who reviewed the 
treatment, made good use of his psychotherapy.  The Applicant was channeling anger, loneliness, and significant stress through his inappropriate sexual 
behavior.  The counseling </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">progressed to the point where the Applicant no longer posed a threat of repeating his behavior in the future. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant acknowledged he made a poor choice of actions, regrets the incident, feels remorse, and is aware of the consequences for his actions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I had ample 
opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor 
or evasiveness, read his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those around him.  It is my impression that Applicant's 
expressions of regret have the ring of truth. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's work performance has been excellent and he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has been recognized for his outstanding work. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The incident appears to be an aberration, is 
isolated, occurred more than 12 years ago, and has not been repeated.  The Applicant demonstrated good judgment in seeking professional counseling. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He has 
worked hard to deal with family issues and move beyond them.  He is married, a loving, caring, patient father with a step child and a child due soon.  He 
considers his most important role is to be a father.  He has turned his life around.  He worked while his wife got her degree and then he got his degree, <EM>cum 
laude</EM>, while first attending night school and then attending full time. The Applicant is a home owner who spends his time remodeling the house. Within the last 
10 years he has gotten himself together both morally and spiritually.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I am confident such conduct will not recur.  The Applicant has markedly changed his life 
between now--at age 31--and when the indecent exposure occurred--while the Applicant was still in high school.  There is clear evidence of rehabilitation.  
C f.<A HREF="01-06337.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.a.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 (P.L. 106-398) apply to the Applicant because he was convicted in State court and sentenced to imprisonment for a term

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the imprisonment was suspended.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find against the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.b. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Because of the significant changes in the Applicant, I recommend 
further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
