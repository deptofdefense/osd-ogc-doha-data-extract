<P>Applicant who initiated and has maintained active dual citizenship with the country of his parents' ancestry (Mexico)  and wants to maintain his Mexican 
citizenship to facilitate his inheriting of his father's home in Mexico.  He fails to extenuate and mitigate security concerns associated with his active 
maintenance of a dual citizenship between Mexico and the US and manifests a preference for Mexico over the country (US) of his birthplace.  By contrast, 
Applicant's immediate family members who reside in the US as citizens of Mexico are not shown to be either foreign agents or vulnerable to pressure or 
coercion such as to pose foreign influence concerns.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On June 23 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on July 30, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on February 25, 2004, and received it on March 4, 2004.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM within the 30 days provided him.   
The case was assigned to me April 12, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (a) exercise dual citizenship with Mexico and the United States, (b) have applied for citizenship with Mexico in 
December 2001 and was issued Mexican citizenship prior to April 203, even though he was already a US citizen by birth, &copy;) have resided in Mexico for 
approximately 25 years to at least 1990, and (d) want to maintain his dual citizenship with Mexico in order to inherit his father's house in Mexico (estimating it 
to be worth $100,000.00), and in part, because of the travel benefits to Mexico.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have parents and a sister, who are citizens of Mexico residing in the US.</P> 
 
<P>For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations without explanation.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old microelectronic assembler who seeks a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are 
incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents and sister immigrated to the US in 1962.  Applicant was born in the US not long after his parents' arrival.  By virtue of his birth in the US, 
he became a citizen of this country.   Following his mother's heart attack in 1965, Applicant and his family returned to Mexico.  Applicant spent the ensuing 25 
years in Mexico, going to school, growing up, and eventually working, before returning to the US in 1990.</P> 
 
<P>While in Mexico Applicant met his wife (W) to be (in 1972) and married there in 1990, just prior to their returning to the US.  W previously applied for and 
received her resident alien certificate.  She has not to date documented any application for US citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>In 1991 Applicant, accompanied by his parents and sister, returned to the US.  Once in the US, his parents worked as legal residents for several years.  
According to Applicant, his parents have since applied for US citizenship and plan to complete their US citizenship applications after they transfer title to their 
exican home to Applicant.  Both Applicant's parents and sister currently reside in the US.  Applicant's sister is a legal alien who currently resides with his 
parents and retains her Mexican citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant applied for and received his Mexican citizenship in 1991 to facilitate his eligibility to inherit his father's home in Mexico (valued at $100,00.00).  
Only citizens of Mexico are eligible to inherit property in the country in their name.  This and the ease of travel in Mexico with Mexican citizenship comprise 
Applicant's stated reasons for taking out Mexican citizenship and his parents' reasons for delaying their application for US citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>Except for the Mexican citizenship he applied for and was granted in December 2001, Applicant has no personal or business ties to Mexico.  He has no 
exican passport and no intention of obtaining one.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has never received or provided assistance to any foreign source and assures he has no reason to believe any of his immediate family members residing 
in the US or Mexico might in any way be vulnerable to pressure, coercion, or compromise.</P> 
 
<P>Since 2000 Applicant has taken several vacation trips to Mexico, which he financed with his own savings.  He has taken no other trips abroad, business or 
personal.  He has no foreign passport and no plans to obtain one.  Further, he has had no contact with any hostile countries and always travels on his US 
passport.  Applicant last visited Mexico in December 2000.  While in Mexico he stayed at his parents' home.  During this stay, he also saw W's parents, who he 
doesn't know very well and maintains little contact.  Applicant assures he has had no adverse security incidents with his current employer.  His claims are 
accepted.</P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list guidelines to be considered  by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
Judges must consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the 
"Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the 
judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the 
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are 
intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions: </STRONG>None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 8: A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 5: Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a conscientious microelectronics assemble with a defense contractor who after being born in the US returned to Mexico for a number of years 
before returning to the US in 1990.  Upon his return to the US, he applied for and obtained (1991) Mexican citizenship.  Claiming his principal affections still 
lie with the US, he assures he only took out citizenship with Mexico to ensure his eligibility to inherit his father's home in Mexico.</P> 
 
<P>Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of 
the foreign country over the interests of the US.  In a different vein, the continued Mexican citizenship of his parents and sister (who currently reside in the US) 
raise potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future pressure or duress that could result in the compromise of classified information.  The issues, as 
such, raise concerns over Applicant's  preference for a foreign country over the US and the potential for members of Applicant's immediate family being placed 
at risk to pressure or duress to induce Applicant to divulge classified information he might be privy to.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By virtue of his birth in the US, Applicant became a US citizen; even though his parents remained Mexican citizens. Applicant's recited reasons for taking out 
exican citizenship (<EM>viz., </EM>maintaining his eligibility to inherit his father's Mexican home and easing his travel when in Mexico) are cited as firm evidence of 
his preference for Mexico over his birth country (US).   Such actions may be considered relevant to a foreign preference issue when assessing the significance 
of an applicant's conduct and circumstances after he acquired foreign citizenship.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (Dec. 19, 2000).  So, Applicant's pre-Mexico 
citizenship schooling in Mexico, his many years of living in Mexico (25 altogether), and his father's house situated in Mexico (which he stands to inherit)  may 
affect what inferences to draw with respect to his motives for later taking out Mexican citizenship and retaining it. </P> 
 
<P>Still, the primary issue here is whether Applicant by applying for and receiving his  citizenship in Mexico in 1991 following his return from Mexico, manifested 
a preference for his birthplace (Mexico) over his birth (the US).  That he preserved his inheritance rights in Mexico by his obtaining Mexican citizenship is an 
important consideration in evaluating the preference issue, but it is not dispositive.</P> 
 
<P>Without denying his affection for his adopted country (Mexico) and place of his father's home (which Applicant stands to inherit), Applicant insists that his 
preference remains for his birth country (US), which he would never compromise under any circumstances, should competing geopolitical interests develop 
between the two countries.  No question but that Applicant manifested his support for the US in several important ways since returning to this country in 1990: 
He abstained from applying for a Mexican passport; he has raised three young children as US citizens who attend school in the US, and he has impressed his 
college administrator and work superiors with his conscientious work ethic. </P> 
 
<P>But Applicant also has manifested enough recent ties and interests in Mexico to raise some doubts as to whether he would always prefer the US over Mexico 
should their interests clash.  Doubt by itself is enough to invoke two disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign preference: DC (the 
exercise of dual citizenship) and DC 6 (using foreign citizenship to protect financial interests or business interests in another country).  Not only does he have 
deep historical roots and family in Mexico, but he applied for and obtained his Mexican citizenship for the purposes of facilitating his inheritance of his father's 
home and easing restrictions on his traveling in Mexico, both valid reasons for his wanting to obtain Mexican citizenship.  Collectively considered, these ties 
undercut his US preference claims and make his expressed desire to seek and retain his Mexican citizenship all the more understandable.  They also make the 
compelling case for ascribing a preference to Applicant for the country of his adoption (Mexico) over the US, were he forced to choose.  For when pressed to 
make a choice, the country of an individual's adoption, family and heritage can often be expected to triumph over his birthplace country.  While such choices 
cannot be presumed with absolute certainty, they can be ascribed with sufficient predictive judgements based on the individual's past conduct and 
circumstances to satisfy the security suitability burdens governed by <EM>Department of Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  </P> 
 
<P>While entirely understandable, Applicant's taking out Mexican citizenship reflects motivational influences across a wide spectrum of interlocking personal 
interests in Mexico that are not checked by Applicant's (a) professed affections for the US and (b) assurances that he can be trusted to safeguard US secrets 
irrespective of his continued dual citizenship with Mexico.</P> 
 
<P>To be fair to Applicant, he has by all accounts been totally up-front about his dual citizenship history, inheritance rights and family relationships associated with 
his roots and ties to Mexico.  Were Applicant's Mexican citizenship limited solely to his parents' citizenship and birth  in Mexico, his US preference claims 
would be more persuasive.  His choices were active ones, however, and reflect conscious elections he made to promote his personal and business interests in 
exico while still employed in the US.  These are choices incompatible with his claimed preference for the US.  Without more developed information in the 
record, none of these choices can be considered to have been US sanctioned by virtue of Applicant's retaining his US citizenship.  So, under the circumstances 
as developed in this record, Applicant may not take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions covered by the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign 
preference.</P> 
 
<P>Taking into account all of the evidence presented in the record, Applicant does not absolve himself of the security concerns raised by his exercising dual 
citizenship with another country (Mexico) and fails to convince that his exhibited preference for a foreign country over the US does not expose him to future 
risks of his providing information that could be harmful to the security interests of the US.  His actions continue to create the kind of competing allegiance 
concerns for clearance holders that manifest in active dual citizenship exercise cases.  Adverse conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by 
sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Besides preference concerns, Government concerns over the risk of Applicant's mother, father  and sister (all citizens of Mexico residing in the US) also 
confront Applicant's security clearance application.  Because Applicant's parents and sister who continue to maintain their Mexican citizenship represent 
members of his immediate family their status raises security concerns covered by disqualifying condition (DC) 1 (immediate family members having foreign 
citizenship or residence) of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The residence status of these relatives in the US pose some potential concerns 
for Applicant because of the risks of coercion or influence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. </P> 
 
<P>From what is known from Applicant's own statement, neither his parents nor his sister have any current working/non-working relationships with Mexico's 
government or have any history of ever being subjected to any coercion or influence to date, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Taking Applicant's 
explanations about his parents and sister at face value,  any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family would appear to be 
insubstantial.  Mexico is a close neighbor and friend with a democratic form of government and an emerging history of respect for human rights and the rule of 
law.  This is not to suggest that Mexico might not at some future time draw DoD concerns about industrial espionage activity or other forms of intelligence 
collection.  Even mature democracies are known to maintain active intelligence gathering regimes.  To ask any more in the way of corroboration from Applicant 
would put Applicant basically to the burden of proving the negative: a daunting, if not impossible burden to fulfill without demonstrated access to Mexican 
intelligence organizations.</P> 
 
<P> Whatever potential security risks that arise as the result of Applicant's having immediate family members with Mexican citizenship residing in the US are by 
every reasonable measure mitigated.  Applicant's situation is set in marked contrast to the hypothetical situation in which the country of citizenship for the 
individual's immediate family has interests inimical to those of the US. While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly 
neutral as to the nature of the subject country, they should not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime 
involved.  And in Applicant's case, the country of his ethnic heritage has no known history of hostage taking or disposition for exerting pressure or influence. </P> 
 
<P>Because of the residence status of Applicant's immediate family members in the US,  any potential risk of a hostage situation becomes an acceptable one, for 
which the mitigation benefits of MC 1 (presence of immediate family in host country poses no unacceptable security risk) of the Adjudicative Guidelines are 
fully available to Applicant.   Applicant may also claim the mitigation benefits of MC 5 (minimal foreign financial interests).  Overall, any potential security 
concerns attributable to Applicant's having family members who are citizens of Mexico residing in the US are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive 
judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his familial relationships in Mexico.  Favorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a of Guideline B.</P>
