  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Administrative Judge's application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 6 and the Judge's failure to apply Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 constitute harmless errors.  Applicant has not rebutted or overcome the presumption that  the Judge considered all the record evidence.  There is sufficient record evidence to support the Judge's conclusion that Applicant's conduct raises security  concerns.  The fact that Greece is not hostile to the United States is not dispositive for purposes of Guideline B.  The United States has a compelling interest in  protecting and safeguarding classified information for any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that  person, organization, or country has interests inimical to the United States.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 6, 2004, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated November 23, 2004.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge made an erroneous finding of fact when he found that Applicant's Greek 
identification card could be used for various rights pertaining to Greek citizenship; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in applying certain Adjudicative 
Guidelines disqualifying conditions in Applicant's case; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in not applying certain Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating 
conditions in Applicant's case; (4) whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply the "whole person" concept when considering Applicant's case; and (5) 
whether the nature of Greece's relationship with the United States renders arbitrary and capricious the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance 
determination under Guideline B.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge made an erroneous finding of fact when he found that Applicant's Greek identification card could be used for various 
rights pertaining to Greek citizenship</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant's Greek identification card could be used for rights pertaining to Greek 
citizenship such as voting and potential travel within the European Union.  On appeal, Applicant asserts that Department Counsel produced no evidence to 
support the finding and that his own testimony lacked certainty on the point.  After review of the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge's 
finding is not sustainable.  However, considering the record as a whole, the Judge's error is minor and no material conclusion reached by the Judge was affected 
by the erroneous finding of fact.  Therefore, Applicant has not established error that would warrant remand or reversal in this case. </P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in applying certain Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying conditions in Applicant's case</SPAN>.  Applicant argues that the 
Administrative Judge erred when he applied disqualifying conditions against him.  Specifically, Applicant asserts: (a) under the Foreign Preference Guideline, 
the Judge erred by concluding there was negative, unmitigated security significance in his possession of a Greek identity card, his possession of a Greek driver's 
license, his voting in a Greek election, and his potential obligation to serve in the Greek military; (b) the Directive does not list possession of a foreign country 
identification card or a foreign driver's license as disqualifying conditions; (c) the Judge failed to take into account that his initial obtaining of a Greek identity 
card, his voting in a Greek election, and his paying property taxes to the Greek government were not voluntary activities; and (d) the Judge erroneously applied 
Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition E2.A3.1.2.6<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to Applicant's payment of property taxes to Greece as there is no record evidence that Applicant was 
using his Greek citizenship to protect property interests there.  Applicant's contentions have mixed merit.</P> 
<P>When a party challenges an Administrative Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines, the Board has to decide whether the party has shown the Judge: 
(i) reached conclusions not supported by substantial record evidence, (ii) acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious; or (iii) acted contrary to law.  <EM>See</EM>, 
<EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-15339 (April 29, 2004) at p. 4. </P> 
<P>Concerning Applicant's first argument, the Board need not engage in a detailed discussion of the Administrative Judge's analysis or Applicant's arguments on 
appeal.  After a review of the totality of the record evidence in this case, the Board is satisfied that the Judge reached a sustainable conclusion that certain 
actions of Applicant in the exercise of his Greek citizenship&mdash;viewed in their entirety&mdash;constituted unmitigated acts of foreign preference.</P> 
<P>Applicant's complaint that the Directive does not list possession of a foreign country identification card or a foreign driver's license as a basis for denial of a 
security clearance is not persuasive.  The Adjudicative Guidelines are not designed to enumerate every set of facts or circumstances that might give rise to a 
security concern on the part of the government or that might mitigate such concerns.  Rather, the Adjudicative Guidelines stake out parameters into which more 
specific facts and circumstances may be categorized.  It is the Statement of Reasons, not the Adjudicative Guidelines, that places applicants on notice as to 
which of their actions or circumstances raise security concerns.  In this case, Applicant's possession of a foreign identification card and a foreign driver's 
license fall under the Adjudicative Guidelines rubric of the exercise of dual citizenship.  Applicant has failed to establish error.</P> 
<P>Applicant argues that his Greek identification card was obtained for him by his parents when he was 14 years old and that he had no choice in the matter.  He 
argues that he was required by law to vote in a Greek election in 1999 because of his presence in the country as a Greek citizen at that time.  He argues that he 
has no choice in the matter of paying property taxes to the Greek government for property he owns in Greece.  Applicant then asserts that inasmuch as these 
actions were and are involuntary, the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding that the security concerns raised by them were mitigated.</P> 
<P>In his findings of fact, the Administrative Judge recognized that the Greek identification card was issued to Applicant when he was 14 years old.  The Judge 
went on to find that Applicant continues to retain an active identification card and that the card has no expiration date.  It was this second finding of fact, which 
involves voluntary activity after Applicant became of legal age, that the Judge focused on when concluding that the identification card raised a foreign 
preference concern.  With regard to voting and paying taxes, while the activities themselves might be considered involuntary in light of the record evidence in 
the case, they are a consequence of other activities by Applicant&mdash; travel to Greece as a Greek citizen and ownership of property in Greece&mdash; that the Judge 
could find voluntary in nature.  Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge erred by not considering the alleged involuntariness of Applicant's exercise of 
Greek citizenship as a basis for mitigation. </P> 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred by applying Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition E2.A3.1.2.6 ("Using foreign citizenship to 
protect financial or business interests in another country") to the circumstance of his paying property taxes to the Greek government for property he owns in 
Greece.  In support of his argument Applicant asserts that there is no record evidence of a requirement that a person must be a Greek citizen to own property in 
Greece and there is no evidence to suggest that he would not have been subject to taxation by Greece if he were not a Greek citizen.  Applicant's contentions 
have merit.</P> 
<P>Applicant's descriptions of the record evidence concerning the requirements for payment of property taxes is accurate.  Given the lack of record evidence that 
the payment of property taxes on property located in Greece is a special obligation imposed only on Greek citizens by virtue of their citizenship (and the lack of 
record evidence that there is no corresponding requirement for owners of property in Greece who are not Greek citizens), there is no basis in the record for the 
Judge to conclude that Applicant is using his status as a Greek citizen to protect or maintain his property there.  Application of Foreign Preference Disqualifying 
Condition E2.A3.1.2.6 is therefore not supported by the record in this case.  However, the Board deems this error harmless as the Administrative Judge's 
adverse security clearance decision is sustainable on other grounds.    </P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in not applying certain Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions in Applicant's case</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the 
Administrative Judge should have concluded that he presented evidence sufficient to extenuate or mitigate the fact that he holds dual citizenship with Greece 
and the United States and has ties to Greece.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues the Judge should have concluded his situation was extenuated or 
mitigated under various Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions.  Specifically, Applicant contends the Administrative Judge should have concluded: (a) 
his Greek citizenship was based solely on his parents' citizenship and should therefore have been mitigated by Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 
E2.A3.1.3.1<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>; (b) the evidence established his willingness to renounce his Greek citizenship and Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> should 
have been applied in mitigation; and (c) with regard to a 650 square foot apartment Applicant owns in Greece, the Judge should have applied Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.5.<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant was born in the United States to Greek parents and acquired Greek citizenship as a result of the citizenship 
status of his parents.  The Board has concluded that Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.1 can be applied where an applicant's dual citizenship 
falls within the literal language of Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.1 regardless of whether the applicant exercised the rights or privileges of foreign citizenship.  
<EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 4.  Given the Judge's finding, Applicant was entitled to have the Judge apply Foreign Preference 
itigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.1.  However,  application of that mitigating condition does not determine the outcome of the case.  The mere presence or 
absence of any given Adjudicative Guideline disqualifying or mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of a case.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0109 (March 
1, 2000) at p. 5.  And, as indicated in ISCR Case No. 99-0452 (March 21, 2000) at p. 3, the applicability of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 
E2.A3.1.3.1 does not render irrelevant any other record evidence that might be indicative of a foreign preference under Guideline C.  As was stated earlier in 
this decision, the Judge found that Applicant had engaged in the exercise of various rights and privileges of Greek citizenship and concluded that such exercise 
raised security concerns that had not been mitigated.  Those findings and conclusions are sustainable.  Thus, the record evidence provides a sufficient basis for 
the Board to affirm the Judge's adverse security clearance decision notwithstanding the applicability of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.1.</P> 
<P>Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude the record evidence did not warrant application of 
Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4 and Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.5.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate 
interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred by deciding that application of these two mitigating conditions was not 
warranted in light of the record evidence in this case.  Moreover, Applicant's argument with regard to Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.5 is 
based, in part, on the assertion of facts that are not part of the record below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM>, Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.</P> 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply the "whole person" concept when considering Applicant's case</SPAN>.  Applicant claims that when considering 
SOR allegations 1.a.,<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 1.d.<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and 2.f.<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> the Administrative Judge committed error by not applying the whole person concept.  In support of his argument he cites 
facts he claims support a favorable security clearance determination.  Applicant's contention is not persuasive.</P> 
<P>To the extent Applicant's argument asserts the Administrative Judge ignored evidence favorable to Applicant, it runs afoul of the rebuttable presumption that a 
Judge considers all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  That 
presumption is not rebutted or overcome merely because Applicant is able to point to favorable evidence that he claims the Judge should have afforded more 
weight.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-15935 (October 15, 2003) at p. 6.  Merely because a Judge makes adverse findings and draws adverse conclusions, it does 
not follow that the Judge is failing to apply the whole person concept or is weighing the evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, in a manner that is arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.  The question is not whether the Judge's findings and conclusions are favorable, unfavorable or mixed; rather, the question is 
whether the Judge's findings and conclusions reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole that adequately takes into account the totality 
of an applicant's conduct and circumstances.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-06194 (July 15, 2004) at pp. 3-4.  In this case, the Judge's findings about Applicant's 
exercise of Greek citizenship, his voting in a Greek election, and his ownership of property in Greece and his conclusions about the ultimate security 
significance of these facts reflect an interpretation of the record evidence that is consistent with the whole person concept.  </P> 
<P>5.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the nature of Greece's relationship with the United States renders arbitrary and capricious the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security 
clearance determination under Guideline B</SPAN>.  In support of his appeal argument regarding SOR allegation 2.f. (dealing with Applicant's property interest in an 
apartment in Greece), Applicant asserts that Greece has never been hostile towards the United States.  He states that, to the contrary, Greece is a United States 
ally and a member of NATO.  Nothing in Guideline B (Foreign Influence) indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United 
States.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (March 29, 2002) at p. 6; ISCR Case No. 00-0489 (January 10, 2002) at p. 12.  The United States has a compelling 
interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of 
whether that person, organization or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.  <EM>Department of Navy v</EM>. <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988); <EM>see</EM>, 
<EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0699 (November 24, 1998) at p. 3.  Additionally, the Board has warned "against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between 
'friendly' nations and 'hostile' nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B."  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (March 29, 2002) at p. 6.  Moreover, 
history shows that foreign countries not considered to be hostile to the United States have obtained unauthorized access to United States classified 
information.<A HREF="03-23806.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Therefore, Applicant's argument that Greece is a friendly ally to the United States does not demonstrate the Judge erred in his resolution of the 
case under Guideline B.</P>
