<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has relatives who are citizens and residents of Iran. His brother-in-law was executed by the Iranian 
government in 1982 for engaging in anti-government student demonstrations, and another brother-in-law, who resides outside Iran, was briefly jailed in 1999 
while visiting Iran. Applicant's wife is also a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the 
administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference). Applicant submitted a response 
to the SOR, dated October 10, 2003, and requested a hearing. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied some allegations contained in the SOR, and 
admitted others while providing explanations in an effort to extenuate or mitigate the security concern raised by the allegation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on November 6, 2003, and reassigned to me on November 21, 2003 due to caseload considerations. A 
notice of hearing was issued on December 2, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 16, 2003.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government 
submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5. GE 1&amp; 2 were admitted into the record and administrative notice was 
taken of the information contained in GE 3 &amp; 5 without an objection. Administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 4 over Applicant's 
objection. The Applicant testified, called four witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's 
Exhibits (AE) 1-6. AE 1-5 were admitted into the record without an objection. AE 6 was admitted into the record over the government's objection. The 
transcript was received January 6, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Before the presentation of evidence commenced, Department Counsel indicated she would move to amend SOR subparagraph 1c. to allege "four brothers" vis 
"six brothers" after the evidence was presented. Applicant indicated he did not object to the amendment. I permitted the amendment before presentation of 
evidence, noting that it would be improper to force the government to proceed to hearing on a knowingly erroneous pleading.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 57-year-old man who is employed by a defense contractor as a circuit design specialist. He has been married to the same woman since July 1977, 
and has two adult daughters who were born in the United States, one who is married to a United States citizen by birth and the other who still resides with 
Applicant and his wife. Applicant was previously married for approximately two years, and that marriage ended in divorce around 1976.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was born and raised in Iran. He attended high school in Iran and following graduation served in the pre-revolutionary Iranian military for eighteen 
months. In approximately 1970 or 1971, Applicant entered the United States on a student visa. He had been provided a scholarship by a United States company 
that was doing business in Iran to attend school in the United States, but lost that scholarship following the 1979 revolution. He attended several different 
schools in the United States earning a bachelor of science degree from one university in May 1977, a master of science degree from a second university in June 
1979, and a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from a third university in March 1984.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant began working for his present employer in October 1984. He submitted a number of certificates of achievement, congratulations, and other awards 
that indicate his work performance has been consistently commendable. Applicant has obtained three patents since he began work for his employer, and is due 
to have a scholarly work published in a professional journal in the near future. He has also authored a novel that he is intending to submit for publication after 
further review. Applicant has possessed a security clearance for the past nineteen years, and there is no indication there has ever been any action taken to revoke 
or downgrade that clearance based upon adverse information or that any complaints have been made that allege he mishandled classified material.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant returned to Iran in 1977 for the specific purpose of obtaining a wife. He met his current wife during that visit and returned to Iran a second time in 
1977 to arrange the marriage and move her to the United States. They were married on July 29, 1977, and have resided together in the United States since. 
Applicant owns two houses in the United States, each valued in excess of five hundred thousand dollars. He has resided in the same residence since June 1994. 
He does not own any property in Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant and his wife became United States citizens in 1984. They retain dual citizenship with Iran.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant considers himself solely a United States 
citizen, and a dual citizen only because the Iranian government requires it. Their daughters are United States citizens, who are considered by Iranian authorities 
to be dual nationals (see fn. 4). Neither daughter has any plans to travel to Iran, although one has not ruled it out as an option.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother, four brothers, and one sister are citizens and residents of Iran. He also has one brother who lives in the United States and another who lives 
in England. Applicant's mother is 83-years-old. His siblings are all middle-aged. None of his relatives have ever worked for or had any other official connection 
with the government of Iran. Applicant speaks with his mother by telephone about once every six months. He seldom has any contact with his siblings, the last 
contact being an e-mail exchange with a brother approximately one year ago. He occasionally speaks with his sister when she is at his mother's house during 
calls with his mother.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant last traveled to Iran in 1991 to visit his dying father. He used an Iranian passport that was issued to him in 1991 to enter the country because it was 
required.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The passport expired in 1995 and has not been renewed. Applicant anticipates traveling to Iran at sometime to see his mother before she dies. He 
expects that he will be required to obtain an Iranian passport to accomplish that travel, however, if obtaining a passport was prohibited by the United States 
because of his status as a security clearance holder he would arrange instead to meet his mother in England.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife last traveled to Iran approximately two years ago to visit her dying father. She used an Iranian passport to accomplish that visit. One of 
Applicant's brothers-in-law was a medical student in Iran who was involved in anti-government protests in the early 1980s. He was arrested and executed by 
the Iranian government for his involvement in those activities in 1982. One of Applicant's other brothers-in-law, who is a nonresident of Iran, traveled to Iran in 
approximately 1999, and was briefly jailed by Iranian authorities. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's witnesses, all of whom are family members, established that he is honest, intelligent, loyal, and apolitical. There is no evidence that would in 
anyway call into question his undivided loyalty to the United States. He credibly testified that if the Iranian government attempted to bring pressure to bear 
upon him through his relatives in Iran he would report the effort and do nothing improper to assist Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">         </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B, 
pertaining to foreign influence, and Guideline C, pertaining to foreign preference, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>.  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon the allegations in the SOR, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM> must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1 applies in this case because Applicant's mother, sister, and four brothers are citizens and residents of Iran. He has limited or no contact with his siblings, 
but does speak with his mother by telephone approximately once every six months. His last trip to Iran was to visit his dying father, and he intends to travel to 
Iran to visit his mother before she dies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Further, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating 
conditions, and an Administrative Judge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not 
present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following information about Iran and its relations with the United States, that was administratively noticed at the government's request, is significant in 
determining whether a security concern exists under the known facts in this case: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Large-scale demonstrations have taken place in various regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a result of a sometimes volatile political climate. 
U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Warning against such travel should exercise caution throughout the country. . . .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal 
possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. . . . Tensions generated by the current situation in Iraq have 
increased the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests abroad posed by those who oppose U.S. policy. Some elements of the Iranian government and 
population remain hostile to the U.S.. . . . U.S. citizens who go to Iran should exercise caution. . . . U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to 
be Iranian citizens have been detained and harassed by Iranian authorities.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iran's support for terrorist groups has long concerned U.S. Administrations, particularly giving Tehran an opportunity to try to obstruct the U.S.-led Middle East 
peace process. Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message. The State 
Department report on terrorism for 2002, released April 30, 2002, again stated, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran "remained the most active state 
sponsor of terrorism in 2002," although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions: the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence 
inistry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iran's human rights practices have been a source of concern to recent U.S. Administrations. . . . U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread 
human rights abuses . . .  including assassinations and executions of regime opponents. . . .<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B: MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign 
citizens are casual and infrequent.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no evidence to suggest that Applicant's family members are, or ever have been, Iranian agents, so the issue under MC 1 is whether they are in a 
position to be exploited by Iran. Iran is a country that has been hostile to the United States since the 1979 revolution that overthrew  the former pro-western 
government. However, there is no indication that it has ever attempted to exploit any resident of Iran for the purpose of compromising a security clearance 
holder within the United States. More specific to the facts of this case, Applicant has been a resident of the United States for more than thirty years, a citizen for 
twenty years, and a security clearance holder for nineteen years. His Iranian relatives have resided in that country during this time. He has traveled to Iran on 
three occasions and his wife has traveled there at least once. The best predictor of whether Applicant's relatives are in a position to be exploited in the future is 
the Iranian government's past conduct. Since Applicant came to the United States in 1971 no action has been taken by the Iranian government to exploit his 
relationship with relatives in Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Still, the hostility of Iran to the United States places a heavy burden upon Applicant to demonstrate that his family ties with relatives living in Iran do not pose a 
security risk.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> To that end he has introduced evidence of his minimal contacts with all relatives, excepting his mother whom he speaks with on the telephone 
about twice a year and whom he plans on visiting before she dies, either in Iran or in England, if necessary. Further, Applicant sincerely asserts that he would 
immediately report any attempt to use his Iranian relatives against him. While it is impossible to say with certainty what would actually occur in that event,<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> 
the assertion is entitled to some consideration, especially in view of Applicant's strong ties to the United States, twenty years of loyal citizenship, and minimal 
to nonexistent close ties with his Iranian relatives. Considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant has met his burden of showing that MC 1 applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As evidenced by his real estate holdings in the United States, Applicant appears to have the financial means to travel to Iran to visit his relatives, including his 
mother, if he so chose. However, not only has he not chosen to visit them, he seldom even speaks or otherwise communicates with any of his siblings, and has 
little knowledge of their daily existence. He does speak with his mother by telephone on a regular, though infrequent basis, but has not visited with her since he 
traveled to Iran to visit with his father prior to his death. Accordingly, I find that Applicant has succeeded in demonstrating that MC 3 applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also receives credit under the "whole person" concept for his twenty years of commendable employment with a major defense contractor, during 
which he has acquired three patents and is about to have a scholarly work published in a professional journal. He has held a security clearance for nineteen 
years, without any disciplinary action ever being taken or security violations or concerns being noted.  Likewise, his earning three college degrees, stable family 
life, significant financial acquisitions, effort on having a novel he has written published, and the love and respect he has earned from his family are all indicators 
of a mature, steady, responsible, and trustworthy individual.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I am satisfied that Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against him. Accordingly, 
Guideline  B is decided for Applicant.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN>.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone 
to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM> is one of those acts that demonstrate a foreign preference.  Applicant obtained and used an Iranian passport after he 
became a United States citizen to visit his dying father in 1991. While use of a foreign passport is an exercise of dual citizenship, possession of an Iranian 
passport is required by Iran (see fn. 5) and recommended by the United States for persons such as Applicant, who are deemed by Iran to remain Iranian 
citizens.<A HREF="02-08244.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> 
<P> MC 1: <EM>Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country</EM>; and MC 3: <EM>Activity is sanctioned by the United States 
</EM>apply in this case. There is no evidence of any other act demonstrating the exercise of dual citizenship. In fact, all evidence indicates that Applicant is a loyal 
United States citizen who only allegiance is to the United States. Therefore, I find that Applicant has successfully met his burden to mitigate the security 
concern caused by his dual citizenship. Accordingly, Guideline C is decided for Applicant. </P>
