<P>Applicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by more than $22,000 in delinquent consumer debt. She failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
security concern under Guideline F. Clearance is denied.<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is challenging the Defense Department's preliminary decision to deny or revoke her security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> on May 5, 2006, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint,  alleges a 
security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. In an undated response, Applicant replied to the SOR and indicated she did not wish to have a hearing. On July 26, 2006, department 
counsel submitted his written case consisting of all relevant  and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant 
and it was received by her on August 4, 2006. Applicant did not submit any information or objections within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me September 
25, 2006. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>1. Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a contractor of the Defense Department. She works as an electric assembly specialist. She has worked for the same company since October 1983.  </P> 
 
<P>2. She married for the first time in 1974 and divorced in 1981. She remarried her current husband in 1984. </P> 
 
<P>3. Applicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by more than $22,000 in delinquent consumer debt (for example, credit card accounts). The SOR alleges seven accounts that have been 
charged off as bad debt or placed for collection. Applicant's admissions, coupled with the credit reports and other documentary information in the FORM, establish the factual allegations in the 
SOR. None of the seven accounts have been paid, settled, or otherwise resolved by Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>4.  Because she did not respond to the FORM, the available information in support of Applicant is limited. In her response to the SOR, she indicated that she had an appointment with a financial 
counseling organization in June. She did not submit any further information on this point. </P> 
 
<P>5. There is no record evidence concerning Applicant's employment record, job training, or constructive community involvement.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for 
each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria 
and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to 
have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination of an 
applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> There is no presumption 
in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been 
controverted.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> And as noted by the Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information 
will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>1. The Financial Considerations Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F,<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts or unexplained affluence. An individual who is financially overextended is at 
risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, 
negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information.   </P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised under Guideline F. As established above, Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability 
or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> What's notable here is Applicant's apparent inaction in addressing her delinquent consumer debt. </P> 
 
<P>I reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply in Applicant's favor. Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence, including documentary evidence, to support application of any 
of the MC under the guideline. Likewise, the record evidence is insufficient to establish that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve her delinquent debt.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>2. The Whole-Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I considered the available information in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is a 52-year-old woman who has been continuously employed by the same company for more than 20 years.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
Her mature age and long-term employment do not help explain, extenuate, or mitigate her financial problems. Also, it appears her financial problems are ongoing and likely to continue.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Although 
there is no evidence that her financial problems arose from gambling, substance abuse, or other conduct that would increase security concerns, her delinquent accounts suggest financial 
irresponsibility by using credit to live beyond her means.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Finally, she did not offer any reliable information to establish proof-of-payment or other arrangements for the accounts in question.<A HREF="05-17269.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
Considering the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern arising under  Guideline F. And 
she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  </P>
