<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 4, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,"</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 13, 2000, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr., on December 7, 2000, but, due to caseload considerations, was subsequently reassigned to, and received by, this 
Administrative Judge on December 26, 2000.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 28, 2000, and the hearing was held before me on January 23, 2001. During 
the course of the hearing, three Government exhibits and six Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were received.  The transcript 
(Tr.) was received on February 8, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted two of the three factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Criterion C (subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 36 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not be revealed.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant was born in 1964 in Scotland, a political division of the United Kingdom--a nation whose interests are not inimical to the United States.  He exercised the rights 
and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of the United Kingdom.  He attended school there; voted in one election when he was about 18 years of 
age;<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and served on active military service with the Royal Navy for nearly seven years commencing in 1982.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In December 1985, during an official visit of his ship to a port city in the United States, Applicant met a young lady who was a native-born American citizen, and a 
relationship eventually developed and flourished between them.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In April 1988, while in the United States, and still on active duty, Applicant and the young lady were 
married.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Upon the completion of his military obligation in January 1989, Applicant returned to the United States, this time as a resident alien, and took up residence with 
his new wife.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He and his wife are now the parents of two children, with one born in June 1990, and the other in May 1992.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In July 1997, after completing the required immigration and naturalization citizenship process, Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  At the time he 
took his oath of allegiance and was granted his new citizenship, he was under the belief he had "personally relinquished [his] British citizenship."<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He no longer considers 
himself to be a citizen of the United Kingdom.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Since becoming a permanent resident, Applicant has returned to Scotland on two occasions.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He and his family traveled there in June 1997, before he became an 
American citizen,<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and used his British passport.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He also traveled there in December 2000, after becoming an American citizen, and used his newly acquired United 
States passport.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Irrespective of having become an American citizen in July 1997, Applicant retained his old British passport.  It had been issued to him in May 1995, and was scheduled to 
expire in May 2005.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He was unaware of the significance of possessing the foreign passport, or its potential impact on his obtaining or maintaining a security clearance, 
until it was recently briefly explained to him.  While Applicant had expressed a willingness to relinquish his British passport in October 2000, and solicited advice from 
DOHA as to the appropriate course of action to follow to comply with the August 2000 passport policy "clarification" issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, 
Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I), he received no such guidance.  On his own initiative, after discussing the matter with his employer's 
security officer, on January 3, 2001, Applicant surrendered the British passport to the British Embassy.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  As of the date of the hearing, Applicant no longer possessed a 
British passport.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has demonstrated a preference for, and loyalty and allegiance to, the United States, and has indicated a willingness to bear arms in its defense.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, 
Applicant's spouse and both his children--all native-born United States citizens--reside in the United States, as does a brother who is a resident alien.  The remainder of 
his family--his mother and two sisters, and their families--still reside in Scotland.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant attended college in the United States and received two degrees, including a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in December 1998.  He has been employed in his 
current position by a Government contractor since March 1999.  The quality of his performance has not been characterized.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for 
access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are 
intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge 
should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>[GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE]:</STRONG>  <STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) the exercise of dual citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>(2) possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</P> 
 
<P>(3) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>(8) voting in foreign elections.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>(2) indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>(4) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of 
the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the 
Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, 
the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts 
raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts 
and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Criterion C, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who failed to formally renounce his British citizenship and 
acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country--in this instance, the United Kingdom--over the United States, and in so doing, he may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  In support of its contentions, the Government has cited Applicant's "dual 
citizenship" with the United Kingdom and the United States; and his acceptance and use of a British passport.</P> 
 
<P>While the Government has alleged Applicant is a "dual citizen" of the United Kingdom--derived from his birth in that country--and the United States, a fact disputed by 
Applicant,<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> it has not offered one scintilla of evidence--either as to fact or law--to support that allegation.  Instead, it has surmised that Applicant's original British 
citizenship presumptively survived his acceptance of United States citizenship, notwithstanding Applicant's oath "in a public ceremony . . . to renounce and abjure 
absolutely and entirely all allegiance to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty of whom the applicant for U.S. citizenship was before a subject or citizen."<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  
That oath, formally taken at the July 1997 naturalization ceremony, and Applicant's subsequent statements, offer more positive proof of a renunciation of his British 
citizenship than conjecture by the Government as to a possible continuing "dual citizenship."  Thus, there is evidence of two separate citizenships--British and 
American--but no evidence of a "dual citizenship" status. In my estimation, Applicant's status in this regard does not quite fall within foreign preference disqualifying 
condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1., and Applicant does enjoy the benefit of foreign preference mitigating condition (MC) E2.A3.1.3.1., and MC E2.A3.1.3.4.</P> 
 
<P>In addition, the Government has argued the significance of Applicant's prior military service with the British Royal Navy, and thus his willingness to bear arms for the 
United Kingdom; and the exercise of "dual citizenship" arising from his possession and use of his British passport to facilitate his travel to the United Kingdom--travel 
which was not "sanctioned" by the United States.  Based on my review of the evidence, I conclude the characterizations by the Government are ostensibly true, but largely 
misleading.</P> 
 
<P>It is quite true Applicant seemingly exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of the United Kingdom--all before he became a 
citizen of the United States in July 1997.  That conduct, while relevant under the whole person concept, in this instance, as a matter of law, cannot constitute the exercise 
of dual citizenship.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  As indicated above, he attended school in Scotland; voted in an election there; and served on active military service with the British Royal Navy 
during 1982-89.  Applicant's voting history and military service while solely a citizen of the United Kingdom are not of present security concern under DC E2.A3.1.2.3., 
and DC E2.A3.1.2.8., and Applicant does enjoy the benefit of MC E2.A3.1.2.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's allegiance to the United States has been questioned, and an allegation made that he prefers the United Kingdom over the United States.  A review of the 
evidence reveals his allegiance and loyalty to the United States are resolute, and supported by significant indicia of same. Applicant has indicated a willingness to bear 
arms in the defense of the United States; he received his college education here; married a native-born citizen of the United States; has two minor children who are native-born citizens of the United States; has maintained a residence in the United States with his family since January 1989; is employed in the United States; and declared 
allegiance to the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Of substantial significance to the Government is Applicant's obtaining a British passport in May 1995--two years before he became a naturalized American citizen, and 
keeping it, unused, after he became an American citizen in July 1997.  The fact he possessed a British passport before July 1997, and may have even used it, is not 
material to this matter.  What is of concern is that he kept the British passport after he became an American citizen, and did not surrender it to the authorities until January 
2001.  It is also significant that Applicant did not use the British passport after he became an American citizen.  It is clear that possession of a foreign passport cannot be 
considered merely in isolation, but should be analyzed in light of all the facts and circumstances, "with the adjudicator needing to consider whether the facts and 
circumstances of possession reasonably indicate the applicant is demonstrating a foreign preference within the meaning of [Guideline] C."<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>As noted above, in August 2000, ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I issued a passport policy "clarification."  While the declared intent of the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo was "to clarify the application of 
Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport," the eventual result was an unmistakable change in the <EM>status quo</EM>.  Because the 
memo superseded prior Appeal Board decisions concerning the possession and use of a foreign passport, some prior rulings were deemed to have applied law and/or 
policy which were no longer considered viable.  One area for which further clarification or explanation might have been beneficial--what action constitutes a "surrender," 
and to whom or what entity does an applicant surrender the foreign passport--remains vague.  In this regard, in October 2000, only two months after the memo was 
issued, but still not widely circulated, Applicant expressed a willingness to relinquish his British passport and, in writing, solicited advice from DOHA as to the appropriate 
course of action to follow to comply with the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo.  He received no such guidance.  Thereafter, on his own initiative, following discussions with his employer's 
security officer, on January 3, 2001, Applicant surrendered the British passport to the British Embassy.<A HREF="00-0460.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  As of the date of the hearing, Applicant no longer possessed a 
British passport.</P> 
 
<P>Thus, the issue, distilled to its basic components, is: whether Applicant's passive action in merely possessing, but not using, his previously issued British passport from July 
1997 until January 2001, constituted the exercise of dual citizenship or was indicative of a preference for the United Kingdom over the United States.  It is clear the 
possession of the British passport after July 1997 falls within DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  The ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo states there are no mitigating factors "related to an applicant's 
personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I construe to relate solely to the use of a foreign passport, 
and not to mere possession of same.  On the other hand, the memo states "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless 
the applicant surrenders the foreign passport. . . ."  Applicant has already surrendered the British passport.</P> 
 
<P>I had the opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor 
or evasiveness, read his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those around him.  It is my impression Applicant's explanations are 
both consistent and sincere, and have the solid resonance of truth.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated 
and overcome the Government's case with respect to the issue of foreign preference.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of 
Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
