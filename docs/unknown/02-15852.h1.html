<P>Applicant's criminal conduct in 1995 and personal conduct concerns over the resulting fine can be mitigated because of the passage of time and because he has 
completed probation and now resolved the fine in full.  Also, he credibly established he had no intent to falsify when he failed to disclose his termination from a 
part-time job in 1996 after an administrative tribunal found he was dismissed unfairly; he believed he had no need to disclose a part-time job.  However, he 
failed to mitigate personal conduct concerns over his failure to disclose a 1999 unpaid judgment when he failed to pay his fine in full and over his failure to 
disclose his travel to Mexico.  Also, personal concerns persist as he failed to provide truthful information about his 1995 arrest in his security interview in 
October 2000. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on August 27, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-15852.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 1 and over personal conduct (Guideline E) 
in paragraph 2. Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on September 24, 2003, and requested a decision without a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>On November 24, 2003, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was forwarded to Applicant on December 1, 2003, where he 
was advised he had an opportunity to review the form, but needed to respond within 30 days of receipt of the letter.  He received the FORM on January 13, 
2004; so his response was due on February 12, 2004.  On February 3, 2004, he submitted his response with an attachment.  (Exhibit A) On February 9, 2004 
Department Council indicated that she did not object to his submission.  On February 11, 2004, the matter was assigned to me, and I admitted Exhibit A into 
evidence.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 32 years old, has been employed by Company #1, a defense contractor in State #1, since March 2000.  Prior to April 1999 he lived in State #2.  He 
completed a Security Clearance Application in April 2000.  (Items 4,5)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has attended three different colleges, but has no degree.  He married in 1993 and was divorced in July 1995.  He lived with another woman and has 
one child born in February 1998.  (Items 4, 5, 6 at page 3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant disclosed in answer to Question 25 that he had been arrested in December 1995 for possession of a controlled substance and was given three years of 
probation in State #2.  (Item 5)  A Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI) records check and other records documented that in December 1995 Applicant was 
arrested for possession of marijuana for sale and unlawful transportation of 235 pounds of marijuana.  He was originally charged with a felony as the marijuana 
had an estimated value of $188,000.  He subsequently pled guilty to a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge, and the transportation charge was dismissed.  
He was fined $3,180 and sentenced to three years probation which began October 1996.  He was also to complete 100 hours of community service and 
participate in any treatment or training programs directed by the probation officer.  In April 1998, Appellant's probation was modified to unsupervised 
probation and his offense was designated a misdemeanor.  In November 1999 he completed his probation, but had a balance due on his fine of $2,800. (Items 5, 
7, 8, 9)  In December 2003 he paid the fine in full.  (Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In April 2000 when Applicant was asked by the security officer to fill out a security clearance application during work hours, he completed the application from 
memory.  He claims that he had no intent to falsify.  (Exhibit A) Applicant did disclose in answer to Question 25 that he had been arrested in December 1995 
for possession of a controlled substance and was given three years of probation in State #2.  (Item 5)  </P> 
 
<P>However,  the government alleges he willfully falsified in failing and to provide truthful answers to several questions:  </P> 
 
<P>Question 37 required Applicant to disclose whether his financial record include any unpaid judgments.  In response he failed to disclose an unpaid judgment 
from the fine which resulted from his 1995 arrest; his explanation for omitting this unpaid judgment is suspect as he signed an official court document in 
February 2000 just two months before completed his security application.  Clearly, Applicant knew of this civil judgment and deliberately failed to provide this 
adverse information to the government or to pay the fine in full.  (Items 3, 6, 9 at page 16) (SOR 2.a., 2.b.)  He subsequently paid the fine in full in December 
2003.  (Exhibit A) </P> 
 
<P>  Question 16 required him to disclose any personal travel outside the United States within seven years prior to filling out his SF 86.  He failed to disclose his 
travels to Mexico.  While he claimed he misunderstood this question with respect to foreign countries he had visited, the question clearly ask applicants to list 
foreign travel outside the United States on other than official US government orders.  The Applicant's failure to list his travel to Mexico is of security 
significance as he was born in Mexico, has family residing in Mexico, and attempted to transport marijuana for a friend to resize in Mexico.  (Items 3, 6, 7)  
(SOR 2.c.) </P> 
 
<P>Question 6 required him to disclose his employment history. While Applicant had a duty to disclose all his employment and failed to document his part-time 
job in State #2 with Company #2 from January 1996 to June 1996, and in response to Question 20 failed to list that he was involuntary dismissed by Company 
#2 in June 1996, I accept as credible his reasons that he had no intent to falsify: he did not list this job as it was part-time and he was later cleared of misconduct 
by an official proceeding of an Appeals Tribunal in State #2 where an Administrative Law Judge  (ALJ) found he was "discharged for the violation of a rule 
which he did not know and which was not reasonably enforced against him." The ALJ concluded that he was not discharged for misconduct.  (Item 3, 
Attachment D)  (SOR 2.d., 2.e.) </P> 
 
<P>Further, Applicant deliberately falsified his answers when he was initially questioned about his 1995 drug-related arrest by the Defense Security Service (DSS) 
in October 2000 when he claimed that a friend had borrowed his car and that the marijuana found by the border patrol must belong to his friend.  (Item 6) (SOR 
2.f)  Records and a transcript of a taped interview by the U.S. border patrol in December 1995 documented that Applicant's car contained 78 individually 
wrapped packages of marijuana with an estimated value of $188,000.  At the time of his arrest Applicant admitted to the border patrol that he was to be paid 
$2,000 to transport a load of marijuana to the U.S. for a friend whom he met when he was visiting his mother in Mexico.  (Item 7)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  </P> 
 
<P>Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.   The criminal behavior was not recent; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.   The crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor criminal incidents in 1995 in State #1 that raised security concerns over this criminal conduct:   he pled guilty to a 
charge of misdemeanor marijuana possession and was fined over $3,000 and sentenced to three years probation.  However, he has mitigated<A HREF="02-15852.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> these concerns 
because of the passage of time as the incident took place nine years ago when he was 23 and in November 1999 he completed his probation.  While he was slow 
to reduce the balance due on his fine, in December 2003 he paid the fine in full.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant did reveal his 1995 arrest on his SF 86 form, he failed to disclose substantial other adverse information which led the Government to raise 
security concerns over personal conduct issues under  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) (2) and (3).  Applicant's omission of relevant and material information 
could reflect questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not 
properly safeguard classified information.  Applicant had a duty to reveal the adverse information requested in Questions 37 about his 1999 unpaid judgment 
and in Question 16 about his travel to Mexico. Also, Applicant misled the DSS agent when he was questioned about his 1995 arrest and failed to provide 
correct information voluntarily in the DSS statement.  He failed to establish any basis to mitigate these concerns.  After considering the Adjudicative Process 
factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant under SOR Paragraph 2 under subparagraphs 2.b, 2.c., and 2.f.    </P> 
 
<P>On the other hand Applicant rebutted and overcame some of the other security concerns.  He documented that he paid in full the fine that was subject to a 1999 
State #2 judgment.  Further, with respect to his part-time employment with Company #2, the government failed to provide any evidence.  Further, Applicant 
provided  a credible and rational basis for his failure to list his part-time job in State #2 and to reveal his subsequent termination.  He listed all other jobs and 
established that his termination for misconduct with Company #2 was not supported in a 1997 decisions of a State #2 Appeal Tribunal which held he was 
"discharged for the violation of a rule which he did not know and which was not reasonably enforced against him." </P> 
 
<P>After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 2 under subparagraphs 2.a., 2.d. 
and 2.e.    </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline J     FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:     For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2. Guideline E:     AGAINST APPLICANT</P>
