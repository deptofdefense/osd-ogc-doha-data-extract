<P>Applicant overextended himself on consumer credit and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2003 seeking a discharge of $42,586 in unsecured debt. He had the bankruptcy dismissed in January 
2004 in order to save his home. Financial considerations persist where he has made little effort to repay his creditors. Alleged personal conduct concerns for failure to disclose his delinquent debts on his 
security clearance application are not proven where he listed his then very recent bankruptcy filing. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On December 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline F, financial 
considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="05-04649.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On January 6, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2006. Counsel for Applicant entered his 
appearance on March 16, 2006. On April 25, 2006, I convened a hearing pursuant to formal notice dated March 24, 2006. Six government exhibits were admitted and testimony was taken from 
Applicant, as reflected in a transcript received May 8, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was alleged under Guideline F to owe $62,317 in delinquent consumer credit card debt and to have had an October 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy listing $140,086 in liabilities dismissed in 
January 2004. Under Guideline E, he was alleged to have deliberately falsified his security clearance application (SF 86) by failing to disclose the delinquent credit card debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.a. 
through 1.h. as having been delinquent more than 180 days in the preceding seven years (question 38) or as currently over 90 days delinquent (question 39). Applicant admitted owing the creditors 
alleged, although he was not sure as to the exact amounts. He also acknowledged the bankruptcy had been dismissed at his request, as he learned no declaration of homestead exemption had been filed 
and he wanted to keep his home. Applicant attributed his negative responses to the financial delinquency inquiries on his SF 86 because he was in bankruptcy when the application was filed and he 
thought his debts had therefore been discharged.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions to unpaid delinquent debt and to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and dismissal are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following 
additional findings:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old equipment technician (mechanic) who has worked for the same contractor since May 1974. He seeks to retain the security clearance he has held for 32 years.</P> 
 
<P>In the early 1980s, Applicant's spouse was a vice president of a small bank that went public. Applicant and his spouse took an unsecured loan of $50,000 that they invested in the financial institution. 
The bank failed in about 1987, and Applicant's spouse lost her job. She managed to find another job, but earned about $20,000 less per year. In February 1992, Applicant and his spouse refinanced their 
home, taking $38,000 to settle the $50,000 loan.<A HREF="05-04649.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant began accumulating credit card debt of his own. In about 1998, his spouse told him that they had to file for bankruptcy. Applicant refused, so she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy individually on 
August 6, 1998. Applicant's spouse signed a declaration of homestead at that time which they assumed had been filed.</P> 
 
<P>In February 1999, Applicant took on a second job as a newspaper carrier. On joint income of $77,830 in 2000 and $82,119 in 2001, Applicant managed to make at least the minimum payments, but 
made little progress toward paying off his account balances because of the extent of his debt and financial support for his daughters and two grandchildren. Both of his daughters are young unwed 
mothers who receive little support from the fathers of their children. Applicant eventually contacted legal counsel about a possible debt consolidation.<A HREF="05-04649.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The attorney recommended bankruptcy. In 
anticipation of the bankruptcy filing, Applicant subsequently stopped paying on several accounts while he remained current on credit accounts opened with a department store retailer, a home 
improvement retailer, and a warehouse club (balance $1,577 as of January 2004), as well as in his mortgage. The financial history of his delinquent accounts follows.</P>

<P>On October 17, 2003, Applicant filed an individual petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, seeking discharge of $42,586 in unsecured debt. He did not include his debt owed on revolving charge 
accounts with retailers as he planned to pay them off. He listed $97,500 in secured debt, the balance of his mortgage loan, but indicated he would retain the property and continue regular payments on 
his mortgage.</P> 
 
<P>On November 3, 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86). In response to financial record inquiries, Applicant listed his October 17, 2003, bankruptcy filing in response to 
question 33 (any bankruptcy filing in the last 7 years), but responded "No" to questions 38 ("In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"), and 39 ("Are you currently 
over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"). By listing the bankruptcy, he figured it covered the delinquent debts and he was not late on his other obligations, such as his mortgage ("I'm saying by filing 
bankruptcy, okay? I have to be delinquent on my, to file bankruptcy, right? So I thought the question might have meant since you filed bankruptcy, have you been late on your mortgage? Have you been 
late on any bills?" Tr. 73).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant subsequently moved to dismiss his Chapter 7 case as no declaration of homestead had been filed with the registry of deeds before the filing of his Chapter 7 petition. On November 24, 2003, 
the trustee objected on the basis that Applicant and his spouse had $132,500 in equity in their residence, and that Applicant's share ($66,250) even with the federal exemption of $17,425, would be 
sufficient to pay the $42,586 in unsecured debt. On December 31, 2003, Applicant countered that he had relied in good faith that counsel for his spouse had filed the declaration of homestead at the time 
of his spouse's Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On January 6, 2004, his Chapter 7 bankruptcy was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant took no effort to inform his creditors of the dismissal or to pay the balances owed as he instead waited for the creditors to contact him. One creditor to whom he owed about $12,000 contacted 
him and offered to settle for $4,000. Applicant did not accept the offer as he was planning to refile for bankruptcy and figured his credit was ruined. Sometime in 2004, he quit his part-time newspaper 
carrier job as he was tired of working seven days a week.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>On November 12, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigations service about his October 2003 bankruptcy. He explained he 
had become financially overextended on consumer credit. He claimed he had never missed a payment until three to four months before his October 2003 filing for bankruptcy, when he sought discharge 
of $42,586 in consumer credit debt. Concerning the dismissal of his bankruptcy, Applicant averred his lawyer had not realized they had not filed a homestead declaration to prevent his home from being 
included in the bankruptcy. He was still delinquent on those debts included in the bankruptcy as he intended to refile for bankruptcy within the next year. Applicant denied any use of a credit card since 
October 2003, and indicated he was up to date on all his other accounts. Applicant reported a net monthly remainder of $1,485 after payment of living expenses and three small retail revolving charge 
debts that he had not included in his bankruptcy filing.</P> 
 
<P>A check of Applicant's credit on November 29, 2005, showed an outstanding revolving charge debt totaling $11,956 ($106 on &para; 1.a., $274 to the warehouse club, and $11,576 on &para; 1.b.) The creditors 
owed the unsecured debt included in the bankruptcy reported zero balances. Applicant had reported balances of $82,240 on his primary mortgage. He also owed $30,646 on a line of credit he had taken 
out in June 2005.</P> 
 
<P>In early April 2006, Applicant contacted the creditor in &para; 1.b. and expressed his desire to settle the debt. He was apprized that due to interest, the balance had risen to $17,000. He also claimed he 
contacted the creditor in &para; 1.d., who told him the "account had been discharged" because of his bankruptcy.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>By April 2006, Applicant had not refiled for bankruptcy. When asked at his hearing about  his reasons for not filing, Applicant responded:</P> 
 
<P>Well I think because I've never got contacted and I was aware that, you know, I'm thinking that the credit card company would come after me somehow and say, you know, give it to a collection agency 
or whatever they do. To not hear from anything, I guess I can honestly say out of sight, out of mind, I really didn't think about it and, as time went on, I probably thought less about it, that nobody was 
bothering me and, you know, like it was gone. (Tr. 40)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's two daughters (ages 26 and 23 as of April 2006) moved out of the family home in spring 2005. Their youngest is living alone with her child. Proud of their younger daughter's completion of 
a two-year program to be a therapist, Applicant and his spouse are helping her repay her $14,000 in student loan debt, although the loans are in their daughter's name.</P> 
 
<P>The home improvement retailer would not extend Applicant any future credit. As of April 2006, Applicant continued to rely on credit for purchases with the other two retailers. He owed  $500 or $600 
on his charge account with the warehouse club and $100 on the other card for a grill that he bought. He and his spouse own a week at a timeshare that they purchased for $7,000 or $8,000.<A HREF="05-04649.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant 
believes it is paid for although they continue to be responsible for maintenance fees, which are "a couple hundred dollars a year." (Tr. 86) Applicant has 401(k) assets. As of November 2004, the balance 
was about $210,000.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After considering the evidence of record, the following adjudicative guidelines are pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG>. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from 
financially profitable criminal acts. (&para; E2.A6.1.1)</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG>. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information. ( &para; E2.A5.1.1)</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude the government established its case with 
respect to Guideline F, financial considerations, as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F, financial considerations, the security concerns arise when the applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness, recurring financial difficulties, or a history of not 
meeting his financial obligations. The government must consider whether individuals granted access to classified information are, because of financial irresponsibility, in a position where they  may be 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant incurred more than $42,000 in unsecured credit card debt by October 2003 that he sought to have discharged in bankruptcy. DC &para; 
E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>, and &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>, apply.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his spouse's financial situation was clearly negatively affected by the failure of the bank where his spouse was a vice president. She managed to find a new job, but her salary was about 
$20,000 less per year. Mitigating condition (MC) &para; E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) </EM>does not fully extenuate or mitigate debt incurred largely due to financial mismanagement on his part, however. With his spouse's 
discharge in bankruptcy in 1998, part of the debt burden was alleviated. He failed to take advantage of the financial fresh start it afforded the family and continued to accumulate personal credit card 
debt. At least one of his credit card accounts (&para; 1.c.) was opened after her bankruptcy, and the accounts alleged in the SOR became delinquent after the bankruptcy. Furthermore, whether Applicant and 
his spouse purchased the timeshare in October 1997, which would have been before her bankruptcy, or six or seven years ago when Applicant was struggling to make the payments on his accounts, they 
exercised questionable financial judgment in taking on a monthly installment obligation when they were overextended on credit.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant made an effort to resolve his delinquent debt in an October 2003 Chapter 7 filing. No adverse inference is drawn from the dismissal itself, since Applicant and his spouse believed in good 
faith that a homestead had been filed in her bankruptcy. Yet, he was still obligated to address these debts. He told the OPM investigator that he would refile the bankruptcy, but did nothing as he waited 
to see if he would be actively pursued by his creditors. Most of his creditors wrote off the debt, and reported a zero balance to the credit reporting agencies. Applicant submits, without citing to any 
specific provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, he is no longer responsible for repaying those debts which have been reported to the credit agencies as charged off with a zero balance. A creditor 
charge-off is an account transfer made when a creditor no longer expects to be repaid. It is noted that the purpose of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 1681 et seq., is to minimize credit 
reporting errors, rather than to give a debtor relief from significant debt burden, which is the purpose of bankruptcy. Since there was no liquidation of his unsecured accounts, the debts remained legally 
enforceable even after they were charged off. Irrespective of whether collection can ensue once a zero balance is reported, the practical effect of the bankruptcy filing is that most of his creditors are not 
likely to pursue him for the debt. When Applicant recently contacted the creditor in &para; 1.d., he was told there was nothing to be done because of the "bankruptcy discharge."</P> 
 
<P>As noted by the DOHA Appeal Board (ISCR 01-09691, App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003), even if a delinquent debt is unenforceable, the federal government is still not precluded from considering the facts 
surrounding the incurring of debt and failure to satisfy it in a timely manner. Not knowing that many of his creditors had simply charged off the debt balances, Applicant made no effort to pay for the 
goods and services he enjoyed because of the credit extended to him. By letter of February 1, 2006, Applicant was provided discovery from the government, including a copy of his November 29, 2005, 
credit report which shows a delinquent debt balance of $11,576 on &para; 1.b. Evidence of recent disregard is seen in his failure to contact that creditor until early April 2006 when he has the  "financial 
wherewithal" to settle the debt (Tr. 88). Assuming Applicant had been aggressively pursued by his creditors at some point (he testified he looks at them as "predators" Tr. 68), their tactics do not justify 
his failure to take reasonable steps to address his legitimate obligations. His exhibited tendency to place his personal interests ahead of his legal obligations is inconsistent with retention of a security 
clearance. Some reform is evident since he is no longer incurring MasterCard or VISA credit card debt, but it is not enough to overcome the concerns for his financial judgment that exist because of 
abuse of consumer credit. Accordingly, SOR &para;&para; 1.b.,1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i. are resolved against him. SOR &para; 1.a. is found for him as he credibly testified that the debt represents a fee for a 
credit card sent to him under terms he declined, and he never used the card.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, personal conduct, the government alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his SF 86 by failing to disclose his delinquent debts. Clearly, where he had filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 on October 17, 2003, he should have responded "Yes" to questions 38 (any debts over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years) and 39 (any debts currently over 90 days delinquent) on a 
security clearance application executed on November 3, 2003. Applicant explained that since he listed the bankruptcy, he thought it was sufficient to cover him as to notifying the government of his 
financial problems, and he was not late on his day-to-day obligations. Nothing in the language of questions 38 or 39 exempts from reporting delinquent debts included in a bankruptcy. Even so, a good 
faith belief that he did not have to report debts included on a bankruptcy would negate the knowing and willful intent required under DC &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and  material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. </EM>While the bankruptcy raises concerns for his financial judgment, he was 
obviously not trying to conceal his indebtedness from the government. He reported reasonably accurately that he had filed for discharge of $40,000 in debt. SOR &para;&para; 2.a. and 2.b. are found for him.</P>
