</P> 
 
<P>On August 31, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) declined to grant the application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>July 13, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>DOHA assigned this case to another

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her SOR response, Applicant admitted to the SOR allegations under Guideline F. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In addition, after a 
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a 45-year-old woman, has worked as a benefit service representative for more than seven years for a Department of Defense contractor. She is 
seeking a trustworthiness determination needed for her position. She attended a technical college after high school.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She is married with six children, including 
stepchildren. Two children are living at home, including one attending college.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In 1995, Applicant and her husband bought two houses. They lived in one house and rented the other house. About 5 years later, they purchased land 200 miles 
away in another state, with the intent of building a house. In 2001, while building the house, her husband fell and broke his ankle. He continued to receive his 
pay from his employer during his convalesce. However, not long after he returned to work in 2002, his boss died, resulting in the loss of his job. Shortly 
thereafter, they sold the house in which they lived, and moved into a trailer located on the lot where they were building their new house. They lived in the 
trailer for one year. When her husband completed building their new house in 2003, they moved out of the trailer and into their new home. They still have the 
trailer on their property.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>A review of Appellant's credit reports dated February 10, 2005, May 18, 2006, January 22, 2007, and the SOR shows 12 unpaid debts totaling $19,782. The 
current status of these debts is as follows:<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In December 2003, Applicant's yearly income decreased $3,000-$4,000 when her current employer reduced her work hours from full-time to part-time. 
Because of the job situation, Applicant did not have medical insurance. During this time, she incurred significant medical expenses for emergency room care. 
She paid her medical bills with her credit card. She and her husband also used their credit cards to purchase materials to build their new house. Applicant's 
husband did not find a new job until March 2005. Applicant returned to work full-time in July 2005.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant recently had neck surgery for cervical fusions. After insurance paid her hospital bill, her bill had a remaining balance of $1,798. She pays $50 a month 
on this bill, which is not listed in the SOR. The unpaid balance as of January 31, 2007, was $1,648.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>When Applicant's husband lost his job, their household income was reduced by $35,000 that year. For the next two tax years, her salary provided the only 
household income, averaging about $30,000 each year. When her husband returned to work their household income increased to $88,700 the first year and for 
the 2006 tax year to $110,000. Applicant's gross income is $2,200 a month and her net income is $1,300 a month. Her husband's gross income is $7,000 a 
month and his net income is $5,200 a month. They also receive $525 a month in rental income from the house being rented by one of their daughters. Their 
total monthly net income is approximately $7,025.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's household monthly expenses are $675 for the mortgage on the rental property, $1,100 for two car payments (a third monthly car payment of $590 
ended in February 2007),<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> $138 for the mortgage on the trailer, $600 for groceries; $655 for utilities, $555 for gasoline for the cars, $220 for insurance, $125 
for medical bills; $200 for clothing, $300 for credit card payments, and $225 for miscellaneous expenses. She failed to included an estimate for her property 
taxes on her current properties, telephone, and cable. I estimate these expenses at approximately $552 a month, for total estimated monthly expenses of $5,345, 
leaving joint excess funds in the amount $1680 a month ($590 of this amount became available in March 2007). Applicant denies having this much money 
available every month because there are unexpected bills each month.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her husband own two properties, one which she values at $350,000 and the other at $90,000. They have a $26,000 mortgage on the second 
property. They have approximately $10,000 in the bank. Applicant testified that her husband does not want to place a mortgage on their current home nor does 
he want to deplete their savings to pay old or new debts because he does not want to lose the house or be without any funds should he lose his job. Instead, 
they decided to pay their current joint debts first, then pay their individual old debts. Applicant provided a proposed payment schedule for repaying some their 
debts, which reflects that most of their debts will be paid by 2009. She also testified to an intent to pay bills in allegations 1.g., 1.i and 1.l in the next 6 months. 
Her credit reports reflect timely payments on many of her debts. She did call a financial counselor who provided no assistance.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's performance reviews reveal that she regularly received an above average rating. She has received special recognition from her employer for certain 
job tasks and skills. Her co-workers describe her as discrete, helpful, and trustworthy.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC 
DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case. Since 2000, Applicant has been unable to meet all her financial 
obligations. While she pays her current financial obligations, she has numerous delinquent and old debts related to credit cards and medical bills, totaling 
around $19,000.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Nine of Applicant's 12 delinquent debts remain outstanding, and 7 debts are more 
than three years old. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>) in full. She gets some credit for not incurring additional 
delinquent credit card debt in the last three years. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) does not apply because she accrued numerous different 
delinquent debts over a period of more than two years.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies. Applicant's husband provided the primary family income, which has been and is 
about three times her income. After losing his job in 2002, he remained unemployed for more than two years. During this same time, her employer reduced her 
work hours to part-time, causing the loss of medical insurance. Her husband's unemployment severely impacted their finances.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or 
under control</EM>) applies in part. Applicant contacted a financial counselor who provided no assistance, but does not receive credit for financial counseling. The 
majority of applicant's debts were incurred between 2001 and 2004. Since this time, she has not incurred any additional outstanding credit debt. With her 
husband's re-employment, she has been able to timely pay her current bills.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies in part. Applicant states that she 
intends to pay her delinquent debts over the next two or three years. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations 
concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt. She has paid one small debt and has developed payment plans for three debts, one of which is not 
listed in the SOR. She has timely made the agreed upon payments.<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for 
past transgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for 
access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant's risk and vulnerability in 
protecting our national interests. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her husband encountered significant financial problems a few years ago. They sold one house and lived in a trailer for one year to reduce their 
monthly expenses, while her husband completed the work on their new house. During this time, they incurred credit card debt to pay medical bills and buy 
materials necessary to complete the house. Since her husband returned to full time employment, they have avoided incurring any significant unpaid debt. They 
have purchased two new cars recently and timely make the monthly payments on these cars. They pay their current credit card debt, and have decided to pay 
their current debts in full, before paying their old debt. Their decision not to allow current debts to become delinquent while paying old debt is reasonable. 
Because of his past job loss and significant time unemployed, Applicant's husband does not want to mortgage their house for fear he may not be able to pay the 
mortgage if he again losses his job. For the same reasons, he wants some cash in the bank. His fear is not unreasonable, thus his refusal to eliminate his reserve 
funds or obtain additional debt to pay debt is not entirely unreasonable.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant does receive some credit for the application of the 3-year state statute of limitations, which applies to 7 of her unpaid SOR debts. <EM>See</EM> State Code. 
Ann. &sect; 1-52(1).<A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Under this statute, her creditors are precluded from using the legal process to collect debts more than 3 years old. Elimination of her 
delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended her potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer 
"financially overextended," but it does not negate her past conduct in accumulating debts which she could not pay</P> 
 
<P>During their more than two years of financial crisis, neither Applicant nor her husband resorted to illegal activities to pay their debts. They paid what they 
could, and simply allowed the credit card and medical bills to go into collection. They are honest and hardworking individuals.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> In light of all the circumstances, 
she has demonstrated that she is trustworthy. There is little chance her delinquent debt could be used to pressure, coerce, or exploit her, or subject her to 
duress or reoccur. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person,<SUP><A HREF="06-12750.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I 
conclude she has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to her finances.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts. The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.' 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, 
and adherence to duty or obligation.' Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
