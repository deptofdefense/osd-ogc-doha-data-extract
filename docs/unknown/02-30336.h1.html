<P>Although his family ties to Israel raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated the concern because the totality of the facts and circumstances

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 21, 2003, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 10, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on February 17, 2004 and the case was assigned to me on February 20, 2004.  A notice of video-teleconferencing hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 8, 2004.  Applicant appeared with a personal representative and the hearing took place as 
scheduled.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered 7 documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.  The Applicant offered 10 documents, 
which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J.  DOHA received the transcript on April 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this Answer, Applicant admitted, with explanation, to all the SOR allegations, and his admissions are incorporated into my findings.  After a thorough review 
of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified during the hearing, and I find his testimony credible.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 58-year-old married man.  He is seeking to obtain access to classified information for his employment as a principal senior staff engineer for a 
defense contractor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Romania and lived there until he was 19 years old when he and his parents immigrated to Israel in 1964.  He was an only child.  
Applicant testified that during the time frame 1963 to 1965, the Romanian government relaxed the emigration policy for Romanian Jews to immigrate to Israel.  
Applicant and his parents as well as significant numbers of other Romanian Jews chose to emigrate to Israel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attended a university in Israel and was awarded a BSE Degree in Electronics.  Compulsory military service is required by Israeli law and from 1970 
to 1978, Applicant served in the Israeli Navy.  Thereafter, he served in the Israeli Naval Reserve from 1978 to 1981.  He was an officer, achieved the rank of 
Lieutenant Commander, and was in charge of the technical staff of Israeli radar stations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1969, Applicant married his wife in Israel, who had also emigrated to Israel from Romania.  They had two children, a daughter and a son, born in 1971 and 
1974, respectively.  Both children were born in Israel and accordingly were Israeli citizens by birth.  Applicant was employed by two defense contractor related 
companies in Israel from 1978 to 1988.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant remained in Israel with his wife and two children until July 1988, when they immigrated to the United States.  On April 30, 1997, Applicant, his wife, 
and two children became naturalized citizens of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant arrived in the United States in July 1988, he accepted a position with a defense contractor and has remained with that same employer to 
present.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is deceased.  His mother lives in Israel, is 80 years old, and continues to reside in the same building she first lived in when she immigrated in 
1964.  Her building is primarily inhabited by older widows, who support each other.  She was a housewife her entire adult life and has no contact with anyone 
in the Israeli government.  She remains in very poor health and is unable to travel any significant distance.  She recently underwent two cataract surgeries.  
Applicant sends his mother small amounts of money, and cards and flowers on Jewish holidays.  His mother  receives a government pension and is self-sufficient.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleged Applicant's mother-in-law was a citizen and resident of Israel.  She died in May 2003.  Accordingly, this aspect of the foreign influence 
concern is no longer valid.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has encouraged his mother to move to the United States throughout the years, however, she has been unwilling or unable to do so.  Presently, 
Applicant's mother is unable to make the 10-to-15 hour trip to the United States due to poor health.  Applicant speaks with his mother on the telephone on 
average once or twice a week to check on her well being.  He visits his mother approximately once a year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had extensive foreign travel in conjunction with his work.  He has always used his United States passport on all foreign travel except to Israel 
when visiting his mother.  When visiting his mother, he used his Israeli passport.  Applicant was unaware of any regulations precluding the use of his Israeli 
passport when traveling to Israel.  Applicant successfully used his United States passport when traveling to Israel in 1998.  AE G.  In 1999, Applicant was 
challenged by Israeli immigration officers when using his United States passport and informed that since he held dual citizenship, he was required to use his 
Israeli passport<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>.  AE D.  Israeli immigration officers handwrote Applicant's Israeli social security number on his United States passport in lieu of a stamp.  AE 
H.  In 2003, Applicant's third and most recent visit after initially using his United States passport, the Israeli immigration officers allowed him to use his United 
States passport, however, they again handwrote Applicant's Israeli social security number on his passport.  AE I, GE 2, Tr. 21-24.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant received his SOR, he was informed that Department of Defense Policy<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> as of August 16, 2000 viewed possession and/or use of a foreign 
passport as a disqualifying condition for individuals seeking a security clearance.  GE 7.  Applicant has since surrendered his Israeli passport and renounced his 
Israeli citizenship to the Israeli Consulate on February 2, 2004.  AE C.  After submitting his security clearance application in 2002 and prior to receiving his 
SOR, Applicant sought the advice of his Facility Security Officer and kept him informed of all aspects of his travel to Israel to visit his mother and sought 
clarification of Department of Defense policy on this issue.  AE D.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife maintain casual contact with their former neighbor and his wife in Israel.  His former neighbor owns an electronics company in Israel.  
Applicant's personal contact with his former neighbor is limited to approximately one-to-two telephone calls a year, generally in conjunction with Jewish 
holidays.  He also sees his former neighbor when visiting his mother.  Applicant's wife has more frequent contact with their former neighbor's wife.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a homeowner in a suburban West Coast City and has lived at the same address for the last ten years.  He also owns a home in a major West Coast 
City and a retirement home in the Southeast.  He has retirement programs worth approximately $200,000.00.  He estimates his assets to be worth approximately 
$1,000,000.00.  It is his intention to retire in approximately five years and move with the entire family to the Southeast.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife inherited property in Israel when her mother died worth approximately $22,000.00.  Gaining or losing that property will have a very minimal 
economic impact on Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant considers the United States his home as his wife, two children and three grandchildren live here.  Applicant pledges his loyalty to the United States 
and that he would never compromise classified information and that he would report any approaches or suspicious contacts he encountered.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted three compelling character references attesting to his reliability, trustworthiness, loyalty to the United States and potential for contributing 
to the defense of the United States.  AE D, E and J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As requested by Department Counsel, I took official or administrative notice of the following facts: Israel is one of several countries that is actively engaged in 
economic collection and industrial espionage in the United States.  GE 3.  There was no evidence that connected Applicant to any of these activities.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security clearance risk exists when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohibitant, or 
close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.  Concerning family ties, the language of Guideline B 
does not require a conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exists based solely on an applicant's family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security 
concern under Guideline B.<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under SOR, subparagraph 2.a, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B.  The concern here is 
Applicant's immediate family member, his mother, and a person to whom Applicant has close ties of affection, his former neighbor, who both live in Israel.<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  
Applicant's nearly annual travel to Israel to visit his mother and contact with his former neighbor has the potential to make Applicant vulnerable to foreign 
influence.  Along with Applicant's mother and former neighbor in Israel, these circumstances raise a security concern due to the potential for foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's employment with two Israeli defense contractor-related positions do not specifically fall into one of the disqualifying conditions under Guideline B.  
Presumably, his previous employment with these companies suggests he has knowledge of certain aspects of Israeli defense systems and the people associated 
with those systems.  His employment in Israel and association with those companies ended in 1988 when he immigrated to the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mandatory service in the Israeli Navy took place primarily in the 1970s, before he immigrated to the United States in 1988 and before he obtained 
his United States citizenship in 1997.  Once his military service was completed, his contact ended with the Israeli Navy and he is not the beneficiary of any 
military pension or related benefits.  Military service for a foreign country is usually and more appropriately alleged under Guideline C for foreign preference, 
not Guideline B for foreign influence.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's contact with his former neighbor in Israel is limited to approximately two telephone calls a year centered around Jewish holidays.  These contacts 
can fairly be characterized as casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying condition applicable under Guideline B raised as a result of Applicant's mother residing in Israel, visiting her, and contact with his former 
neighbor is:  &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions applicable under Guideline B are:  E2.A2.1.3.1 A determination that the immediate family member(s), <EM>(spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters), </EM>cohabitant, or associate(s) in question <EM>are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States, </EM>and E2.A2.1.3.3: Contact and correspondence 
with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent, respectively.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence shows Applicant's mother and former neighbor are not Israeli agents, and so the issue under MC 1 is if the family members or associates 
are in a position to be exploited by the Israeli authorities.  Because Israel is one of several countries engaged in economic espionage against private industry in 
the United States, Applicant has the burden to show his family ties to Israel do not pose a security risk or concern.  On this point, I note neither his mother or 
former neighbor are employed by or connected to the Israeli government and therefore vulnerable to pressure from the government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Likewise, neither his mother or former neighbor are associated with a political, scientific, commercial, or other activity that would benefit from obtaining 
United States national security information.  His mother is elderly, in poor health, and unable to travel to the United States to visit her son and grandchildren.  
She has lived in the same building she initially lived in when she immigrated to Israel in 1964 and is surrounded by elderly widows similarly situated.  
Applicant speaks to his former neighbor one-to-two times a year around Jewish holidays and his contact can be characterized as casual and infrequent.  
Although Applicant's wife speaks to the wife their former neighbor on a more frequent basis, her social contacts cannot be imputed to Applicant.  Given these 
circumstances, there is not a reasonably foreseeable risk<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> that his family ties might be exploited. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although MC 1 and 2 are applicable mitigating conditions, the analysis does not necessarily end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security 
concern.  Applicant and his family have spent the last 16 years in the United States.  His ties or connections to the United States are substantial and deserving of 
consideration in mitigation.  Since his arrival here, Applicant can fairly be described as a model immigrant.  He, his wife, and two children all became United 
States citizens on April 30, 1997.  He has substantial real property interests in the United States and has a net worth in excess of $1,000,000.00.  The property 
his wife expects to inherit in Israel from her mother's estate worth $22,000.00 is insignificant when compared to his assets in the United States.  His two 
children and three grandchildren reside nearby.  Applicant has purchased a retirement home in the Southeast and plans to retire and relocate the entire family 
there.  In short, Applicant's whole life is based in the United States.  These are examples of ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy such as 
the United States.  His substantial ties to the United States reinforce and lend credibility to Applicant's pledge that he would resist and report any potential 
foreign influence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means.  Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline C for foreign preference, a security concern may exist when an individual acts in a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over 
the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Applicant held 
dual citizenship with Israel and the United States, possessed an Israeli passport, and used his Israeli passport when traveling to Israel.  Disqualifying conditions 
raised are:  &para; E2.A3.1.2.1: The exercise of dual citizenship and &para; E2.A3.1.2.2: Possession and/or use of a foreign passport. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's past and infrequent use of an Israeli passport when traveling to Israel to visit his mother occurred out of Applicant's mistaken belief that he was 
required to use his Israeli passport coupled with the fact there he was unaware of any prohibition against the use of his Israeli passport.  Upon being made aware 
of the contents of the Money Memo, he ceased using his Israeli passport and has since renounced his Israeli citizenship and surrendered his Israeli passport to 
Israeli officials effective February 25, 2004.  Applicant has cured this concern by ceasing the use of his Israeli passport when he became of aware it was a 
concern and by the very definitive and final action of formally renouncing his Israeli citizenship and surrendering his passport.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions applicable are:  &para; E2.A3.1.3.1: Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country, E2.A3.1.3.2: 
Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship, and E2.A3.1.3.4: Individual has 
expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.<A HREF="02-30336.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Guideline C is decided for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, the record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of an industrious, mature, responsible, and trustworthy individual. After 
weighing the record evidence as a whole, it is my commonsense determination that the facts and circumstances show Applicant's  ties to Israel do not pose an 
unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the whole-person concept and the appropriate factors and 
guidelines in the Directive.  And I have weighed the record evidence as a whole, and conclude the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence.  
Under the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude Applicant has met his burden.</SPAN></P>
