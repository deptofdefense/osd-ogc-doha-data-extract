<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sixty-one-year-old Applicant was a Facility Security Officer (FSO) for six years.  She was primarily responsible for enforcing security requirements in her workplace.  She asked the Defense 
Security Service (DSS) Industrial Security Representative (ISR) about obtaining accreditation for her employer's laptop computer. The DSS ISR told her the references for accomplishing this 
objective, but she was unable to understand and complete requirements.  She authorized contractor's employees to place classified information on the unaccredited, laptop computer on ten 
occasions, and then self-reported the security violations.  She </SPAN>failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to  security violations. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On January 10, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On October 11, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, 
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines K (Security Violations), and E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn answer on November 16, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On September 21, 2006, the case was assigned to me 
and on November 8, 2006, the hearing was held.  On November 28, 2006, DOHA received the transcript, and on December 8, 2006, it was provided to me.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel asked for administrative notice of Exhibit I (R. 13-14).  Exhibit I is the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DoD 5220.22-M, dated January 
1995, with Change 1 (July 1997) and Charge 2 (Feb. 2001) (NISPOM), a total of 44 pages.  Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service</EM>, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 
(3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known, or from government publications or  government reports. <EM> See</EM> 
Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exhibit I, and I approved 
administrative notice of Exhibit I (R. 13-14).  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted that she violated security rules as alleged in the SOR &para;1.a,  but denied that security was compromised and that her personal conduct has detrimental security implications as 
alleged in SOR &para; 2.a.  She explained that she self-reported the security violation, and disclosed other extenuating circumstances and mitigating information. Her admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 61-years-old.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She received a secret clearance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1963, a confidential clearance from Department of Energy in 1978, and a secret clearance 
from the Department of Defense (DoD) in 1983.  Her clearance as well as the clearance for the contractor's facility was downgraded to confidential in 1992 because there was no need to use secret 
information (R. 38, 53).  She has been employed as a contract administrator and facility security officer (FSO) for the same defense contractor for the last six years.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has attended college 
courses, but did not receive a college degree.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has no prior military service.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As FSO, she was responsible for directing "security measures as necessary for . . . safeguarding information."<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She is "responsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to [her].  The 
extent of protection afforded classified information shall be sufficient to reasonably foreclose the possibility of its loss or compromise." NISPOM, paragraph 5-100.  The data protection, data 
integrity, and auditing requirements for multi-user systems,<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> such as a laptop computer used by multiple employees are extensive.  <EM>See</EM> NISPOM, Chapter 8, Section 6.  The primary purpose of 
accrediting a computer is to set up software that will assist in identifying users, and the manner of the computer's use for auditing purposes (R. 23-24). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2003, Applicant, acting in her role as FSO asked a Defense Security Service (DSS) Industrial Security Representative (ISR) about the procedure for establishing or accrediting a computer 
for classified information (R. 19, 24).  The DSS ISR told her that Chapter 8 of the NISPOM and a website would have the information she needed for accreditation of her employer's computer, but 
he would not help her prepare the computer for accreditation (R. 19, 57-60).  She was concerned about her company's requirement to get reports completed on time (R. 54).  She sought the 
assistance of several technical assistants, but was unable to meet the technical requirements to get the computer accredited (R. 31). She asked the Navy for help, but they declined to provide any 
assistance developing the accreditation (R. 47). She did not understand and was not adequately trained concerning the information technology and security requirements (R. 25, 39, 40, 43; Exhibit 5, 
at 11).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant put a label on a laptop computer stating it contained confidential, restricted data (R. 40), but it did not have the DoD warning banner on the monitor's screen (R. 52). With respect to the 
laptop computer, the accreditation process would have resulted in a better password, and a more secure operating system and security system (R. 49-50).  The laptop computer was never connected 
to a network (R. 42).  From late May 2003 until mid-July 2003, she authorized two other employees to use the unaccredited, laptop computer in lieu of a typewriter to prepare three reports each 
totaling about 100-pages which each contained a total of about two pages of classified sections (R. 39, 41, 56; Exhibit 5, at 5, 7-8, 10-11).  She logged the computer out to two employees a total of 
ten occasions (R. 72-74; Exhibit 5, at 13).  The two employees who used the unaccredited, laptop computer were cleared to the confidential clearance level (Exhibit 5, at 5, 8).  The material on the 
computer was classified at the confidential level.  She limited access to the unaccredited, laptop computer using a password, and stored it in a locked office within a closed area secured with a 
combination lock (R. 40-41).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 28, 2003, she self-reported that she had used an unaccredited computer to process classified information because her conscience was bothering her and she believed she would get caught 
(R. 20, 25, 27, 60-61; Exhibit 5, at 2-3).  The DSS ISR initiated an Administrative Inquiry concerning the alleged security violation (R. 20-21), which was followed by an additional, more formal 
investigation (R. 21).  During the investigation, she admitted that she allowed two cleared employees to load classified information on the unaccredited computer on about ten occasions (R. 22, 24, 
26).  The investigations established that no classified material was compromised (R. 25, 26). The DSS ISR concluded Applicant was truthful in the investigation (R. 27). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After July 28, 2003, she continued to seek accreditation of the laptop computer, but her lack of understanding of the technical requirements for accreditation delayed the accreditation.  Assembling 
the documentation and establishing the security requirements to obtain classified accreditation for a multi-user computer is onerous, especially for personnel who lack information technology 
training and experience (R. 67-70).  Before, during and after the investigation, when not being used the computer concerned was kept locked in a security container at the company (R. 25).  In 
February 2006, after receiving additional training and some assistance, the computer received interim accreditation (R. 22, 44-45, 57).  There were no other security violations aside from those in 
2003 (R. 28).  Her clearance was not suspended after the investigation (R. 30, 45-46). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an outstanding worker (R. 76).  She is reliable, trustworthy and honest (R. 76-77).  The investigation of security violations made her more conscientious about enforcing security 
requirements, and caused greater security awareness in her company (R. 46, 77).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>  She is now a better FSO because she is more scrupulous and meticulous about her FSO duties.  <EM>Id</EM>. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth and 
discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).</SPAN><A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Security Violations</STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline K, &nbsp;the Department of Defense is concerned that noncompliance "with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard 
classified information." Directive &para; E2.A11.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are two security violations disqualifying conditions (SV DC) listed in Directive &para; E2.A11.1.2, but only one potentially raises a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  SV DC 
2 applies where there have been violations "that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence."  Directive &para; E2.A11.2.2.  Applicant deliberately and knowingly violated the NISPOM on multiple 
(ten) occasions by authorizing employees to place classified information on an unaccredited, laptop computer.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Any of four security violations mitigating conditions (SV MC) could potentially mitigate security concerns.  For SV MCs 1-3 to be applicable the security violation must be "inadvertent" (Directive 
&para; E2.A11.3.1), "isolated or infrequent" (Directive &para; E2.A11.3.2), or "due to improper or inadequate training" (Directive &para; E2.A11.3.3).  For SV MC 4 to apply, Applicant must "demonstrate a 
positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities."  Directive &para; E2.A11.3.4.  SV MCs 1-3 do not apply because the ten security violations were a deliberate and knowing decision to 
violate the NISPOM after the DSS ISR specifically told her about the accreditation requirements.  Their temporal proximity to each other as compared to her long history of compliance with 
security requirements are not sufficient to merit application of SV MC 2, but do merit credit in the whole person analysis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SV MC 4 applies to this case. After July 28, 2003, she renewed her commitment to security.  She was remorseful about her security violations and redoubled her emphasis on being more 
conscientious about security.  She is a devoted employee who is trustworthy and serious about security.  She has a positive attitude and has taken demonstrative and positive steps in discharging her 
security responsibilities.  However, in ISCR Case No. 04-04264 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2006) the Appeal Board stated:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant's suitability for access to 
classified information.  ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998).  Once it is established that [a]pplicant has committed a security violation, he has "a very heavy burden of 
demonstrating that [he] should be entrusted with classified information.  Because security violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any 
claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny."  ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 20,2001).  In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an 
indicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use).  Here the issue is not merely an indicator, rather the Judge found [a]pplicant 
disregarded in-place security procedures in violation of the NISPOM.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While I conclude that VC MC 4 is applicable in mitigation, I also conclude that, it is of insufficient weight to overcome the disqualifying conduct.  Accordingly, SOR allegation 1.a. under Guideline 
K of the Directive is concluded against Applicant.  <BR> 
</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One personal conduct disqualifying condition (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.<A HREF="05-01154.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  PC DC 5 applies where an applicant has "a pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For SOR &para; 2.a, </SPAN>Applicant's ten violations of the NISPOM are a pattern of rule violations.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 
20, 2001) (describing as rational the Judge's conclusion that several security violations in connection with a five-day meeting were a "pattern of rule violations").   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of any of seven personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be 
mitigated when the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The security violations as 
alleged in SOR &para; 2.a are established by substantial evidence, and they pertain to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">information that was substantiated and pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  
Accordingly PC MC 1 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><A NAME="cp223"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns can be mitigated under PC MC 5 when an applicant "has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."<EM>  </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.5.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On July 28, 2003, Applicant disclosed the security violations, and she is not currently vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress.  This mitigating condition primarily relates to PC 
DC 1, rather than PC DC 5.  Nevertheless, her disclosure and candid, cooperation is sufficient to support partial application of PC MC 5.  She also deserves some credit under the "whole person" 
concept for providing accurate information throughout the investigation and at her hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's six-week series of security violations reflect </SPAN>questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">they  are relatively 
isolated offenses and somewhat remote in time.  Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 and 6.3.2.  Moreover, her timely and accurate disclosure of the security violations has eliminated her </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and mitigated security concerns under Guideline E.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under 
Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">provision E2.2.1.  As noted above, Applicant's security violations were serious and premeditated.  Throughout the six-week period in 2003 when she was authorizing security violations, 
she had every opportunity to reconsider her choices.  E2.2.1.1. Her actions concerning the security violations were knowledgeable and voluntary.  She knew she was not supposed to permit 
classified information on the unaccredited, laptop computer, but she authorized it anyway.  E2.2.1.2 and E2.2.1.5.<SUP></SUP>  She committed ten violations in a six-week period ending on July 28, 2003.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has held a clearance for more than 40 years. Thus, her relatively brief period of security violations must be balanced against her overall security history.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.3.  She was in his late 50's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also argued for consideration of the adjudicator considerations in Directive provision E2.2.5, and the Appeal Board has noted their relevancy to the decision process in ISCR Case No. 04-00631 at 4 (App. Bd.

thereafter during the subsequent investigations.  She was fully truthful and candid at the hearing.  She followed the guidance of the DSS ISO after July 28, 2003.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even while the security violations 
were occurring, she undertook some measures to ensured no classified information was compromised.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her conduct favorably resolved the security concern because she ensured the laptop was 
secured until it was accredited in 2006.  She demonstrated positive changes in behavior and employment. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Moreover, the government did not suspend her clearance in 2003 when the violations were 
recent and her track record of change and rehabilitation were not yet established.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Her evidence that she has learned from her mistakes and has an enhanced, conscientious desire to protect and safeguard national security is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">her strongest evidence of mitigation, but her multiple 
breaches of her FSO responsibility to enforce security requirements weighs heavily against her. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not </SPAN>mitigated the security concerns pertaining to security violations, but she has mitigated security concerns regarding personal conduct.       </P>
