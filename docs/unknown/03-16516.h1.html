<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns were raised regarding a 45-year-old Iranian-born naturalized U.S. citizen who was sent out of Iran by his father during the 1979 revolution 
when he was 19 years old.  He completed degree requirements at a U.S. university, and, in 1991, became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  He is married to a 
naturalized U.S. citizen and has a child born in the U.S.  He has a permanent resident, non-U.S. citizen, mother (a citizen of Iran), two siblings who continue to 
be citizens and residents of Iran, and one sibling who has been granted political asylum in France. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His Iranian passport has been allowed to expire and will not

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written answer, dated January 12, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to another administrative judge, but due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by,  me on March 30, 2004.  A notice of hearing 
was issued that same day, and the hearing was held on April 22, 2004.  During the course of the hearing, one joint exhibit, four government exhibits, three 
Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2004.</SPAN></P>

the Shah fled Iran during the revolution and establishment of a new theocratic republic, now known as the Islamic Republic of Iran, guided by fundamental

<P>Applicant first obtained an Iranian passport in January 1979,<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> prior to departing Iran.  He subsequently had it renewed, with his most recent renewal occurring 
in 1999, after he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  His current passport expired earlier this year.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He has no intention of renewing it.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  Applicant's 
explanation for maintaining his Iranian passport was that it was the sole source of official identification he had and it was necessary to obtain various records of 
his past such as his birth certificate, high school diploma, or to sponsor travel to the U.S. by his family members.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Following the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Ayatollah Khomeini, internal political struggles and unrest continued with severe human 
rights violations and the seizure of the U.S. embassy.  When Khomeini died in 1989, an election was held to select a successor.  Successive elections were also 
held in 1993, 1997, and 2001.  Prior to the 2001 election,<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> there was an effort made within the Iranian-American community in the U.S. to try to elect a 
moderate president of Iran with the eventual hope of normalizing relations between the two countries.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Mohammad Khatami-Ardakani, the president, was 
perceived as the moderate candidate in the U.S.,<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> and Applicant, for the first and only time in his life, decided to vote in the Iranian presidential election,<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> 
because he did not want to see another extremist running Iran.  He did so by casting his ballot at a local hotel in the town where he resides.<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE:</STRONG>  <STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to both adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_87_"><SUP> (87)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, his two brothers and sister--are not citizens or 
residents of the United States or may be subject to duress.  The concern also carried over to Applicant's mother because of her citizenship status as a non-citizen permanent resident of the U.S.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  In support of its contentions, the government has cited the fact Applicant's mother is a 
citizen of Iran residing in the U.S., one brother and sister are citizens of Iran residing there, and one brother is a citizen of Iran residing in France.  Those simple 
facts are not controverted, and, standing alone, might be sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under 
Guideline B:<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_88_"><SUP> (88)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The citizenship and resident status of Applicant's brothers and sister, as well as the citizenship status of his mother, when considered in light of the nature of the 
government in Iran--a totalitarian theocratic government whose interests are inimical to the United States and which is known to conduct intelligence 
operations and economic espionage against the U.S.--activates Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, 
or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) and DC E2.A2.1.2.2. 
(<EM>sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse influence or duress exists</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  
Applicant's two siblings who remain in Iran--a shopkeeper/business man and a housewife--are the only persons seemingly coming within the ambit of security 
concern.  Those relationships, while continuing primarily via telephone communications a few times each month, remain emotionally, but not physically, close.  
They have seen each other only three times in the past 25 years.  Applicant does not send them any living expenses and does not discuss his business.  As far as 
the potential for influence is concerned, it should be noted that Applicant has declared he would not cooperate with Iranian agents if his siblings were threatened 
in any way because his family in the U.S. is more important to him than his brother and sister in Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Equally meaningful is the historical perspective.  Since his arrival in the U.S. 25 years ago, and especially since he has been employed by a defense contractor 
since 1997, there have been no instances of Iranian government efforts to capitalize on his two siblings' Iranian residence and citizenship or Applicant's 
employment or security clearance status.  When asked what he would do if Iran threatened his brother or sister unless he furnished sensitive, or even something 
innocuous, Applicant declared he would not risk his own family or his country, referring to his family in the U.S. or the U.S. government, in favor of his sister, 
and would immediately report the situation to the authorities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The best predictor of whether an applicant's relatives are in a position to be exploited in the future by a government which has no interest in complying with 
human rights and liberties, or even with the accepted rules and norms of international law, is the government's past conduct.  In this case there have been no 
incidents and no pressure applied directly or indirectly.  Considering all of the above, including the Iran's past conduct, as well as the citizenship and residency 
status of Applicant's one brother and sister, I do not consider them to constitute unacceptable security risks.  Considering the citizenship and residency status of 
Applicant's mother and his other brother who has been granted political asylum in France, I do not consider them to constitute unacceptable security risks 
either.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is, however, one issue which is of potential concern.  Applicant's primary focus is on the protection and security of his wife and child--surely a laudable 
concern.  If his wife and child should happen to return to Iran for another visit, possible actions by the Iranian government or its agents against them while they 
are in Iran raises the potential for a nasty confrontation.  While he would have little difficulty in withstanding pressures from Iran directed against his siblings, 
he may be more vulnerable to pressures involving his wife and daughter.  Now that he is aware of the government's security concerns, I am confident that when 
the possibilities of such vulnerability have been explained to him, Applicant will apply the same restraint to their travel to Iran as he has now done to his own, 
and the vulnerabilities will be diminished.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also applicable, in this instance, is FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security 
responsibilities</EM>).  As noted above, neither Applicant nor his wife has any financial interests in Iran whereas their entire, and substantial, holdings are in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the above, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's 
case under Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a. through 2.e. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The government has also established its case under Guideline C.  It is quite true Applicant exercised one of the rights and privileges of a citizen of Iran by 
renewing and using an Iranian passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Applicant's allegiance to the United States has been questioned because of 
his exercise of Iranian citizenship, and an allegation was made that he thus prefers Iran over the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the evidence reveals his allegiance and loyalty to the U.S. are resolute, and supported by significant indicia of same.  Applicant has: indicated a 
willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship; allowed his Iranian passport to expire with no intention to renew it; received his college degree here; maintained 
a residence in the U.S.; created a family here with his wife and child; been employed in the U.S.; and declared allegiance to the U.S.  It is clear that possession 
of a foreign passport cannot be considered merely in isolation, but should be analyzed in light of all the facts and circumstances, "with the adjudicator needing 
to consider whether the facts and circumstances of possession reasonably indicate the applicant is demonstrating a foreign preference within the meaning of 
[Guideline] C."<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_89_"><SUP> (89)</SUP></A>  The ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo appears to be conclusive in this regard, negating any consideration of the facts and circumstances.  Thus, the issue is: 
whether Applicant's actions in keeping, renewing, and using his Iranian passport, from January 1991, when he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen, until it expired 
in 2004, constituted the exercise of dual citizenship and were indicative of a preference for Iran over the U.S.  Applicant's actions in retaining, renewing, and 
using the Iranian passport were exercises by him of his Iranian citizenship and fall within Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. 
(<EM>the exercise of dual citizenship</EM>) and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2. (<EM>possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>However, Applicant's dual citizenship is based solely on his birth in Iran.  Thus, Applicant benefits from Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) 
E2.A3.1.3.1. (<EM>dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country</EM>).  His willingness and efforts to renounce his Iranian 
citizenship comes within FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4. (<EM>individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>).  The ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo states there are no 
mitigating factors "related to an applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I 
construe to relate to the use of a foreign passport.  In this instance, Applicant has used that passport on three occasions since obtaining his U.S. citizenship.  
Furthermore, the memo states "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport. . . ."</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in April 2003, he volunteered to "relinquish" the passport if required 
to do so, knowing he would no longer be able to visit Iran.  It is unclear if Applicant was apprised of the existence of the ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo at that time, and he 
took no further actions in that regard.  At some otherwise unidentified point in the processing of this case, a copy of the memo was furnished to Applicant.  It is 
known that a copy of the memo was furnished to Applicant on March 16, 2004.  The Iranian passport was simply permitted to expire.  While he may have 
believed that he had complied with the surrender provisions of the ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo, it has been determined by the Appeal Board that expiration of a foreign 
passport is not equivalent to a surrender of it because "surrender contemplates returning it to the issuing authority, and merely keeping a foreign passport until it 
expires does not satisfy this requirement in the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP> I memo."<A HREF="03-16516.h1.html#N_90_"><SUP> (90)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>I believe that interpretation is far too inflexible and is contraindicated by Enclosure 2 of the Directive which requires "an overall common sense determination."  
oreover, it implies a requirement that does not have any basis in fact-that the foreign passport be surrendered "to the issuing authority."  When Applicant's 
Iranian passport expired, it effectively and legally became a useless piece of paper which could no longer be used for the purposes for which it was initially 
created.  It ceased to exist.  A document no longer in existence need not be returned, or surrendered, as seemingly required by the Appeal Board, for it has 
already been abandoned or surrendered to uselessness.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One of Applicant's actions--that of voting in the 2001 Iranian presidential election--falls within </SPAN>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.8. (<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>voting in foreign elections</EM>).  In this 
instance, however, Applicant's actions were motivated solely for honorable reasons, and not for personal gain or to show a preference for Iran over the U.S.  He 
was part of an effort made within the Iranian-American community in the U.S. to try to elect a moderate president of Iran with the eventual hope of normalizing 
relations between the two countries because he did not want to see another extremist running Iran.  His goal would seem to be identical to that of the U.S. 
government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the above, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's 
case under Guideline C.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
