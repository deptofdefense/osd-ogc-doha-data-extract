<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Pro Se</STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, born in South Korea,  became a United States citizen in 1998.  His wife also became a U.S. citizen, and they have three children, who are citizens of 
the United States. Applicant's parents and in-laws are citizens and residents of South Korea. His parents plan to move permanently to the United States. His 
sisters are U. S. citizens, who reside in South Korea. None of these family members belong to, or are active with any government agency of South Korea.  They 
are not in a position to be exploited by South Korea in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to 
the United States. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.   </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 30, 
2005, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, dated February 1, 2005, and he requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On March 14, 2005, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice, dated March 30, 2005, a hearing was conducted on 
April, 12, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 4 documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1- 4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 5 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-E) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on April 22, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR 
contains four allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.c., and denied 1.d</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is<EM> </EM>33<STRONG> </STRONG>years old. He is employed as a Materials and Process Engineer by a United States defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in South Korea in 1957 and first emigrated with his family to the United States in 1986. His parents and he moved back to Korea after a 
year and a half, because his grandmother in Korea was ill, but his two older sisters remained in this country.  After three years in Korea, he moved back to the 
U. S., and in 1998, he became a naturalized U. S. Citizen. Applicant is married, and he and his wife have three children, who were all born in the United States 
and are U. S. citizens. He received both a Masters and a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from a United States university.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection 
or obligation, who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are South Korean </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> citizens. They reside approximately seven months of the year in South Korea and the rest of the year in the United States. 
They plan to move to the U. S. permanently, as soon as Applicant's father is granted permanent alien status. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both of them are retired. His father was a 
pharmacist, who owned his own pharmacy in South Korea, and his mother was a homemaker. Neither of them ever worked for, or had any affiliation with, the 
South Korean Government. Applicant rarely communicates with his parents when they are in Korea, but he sees them regularly when they are in the United 
States. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has  two sisters, who were </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">born in South Korea</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, but educated in the United States. They are United States citizens, but both of them now reside in 
South Korea with their husbands.  One sister is a pediatrician and the other is a music and piano instructor. Neither of them, nor their husbands, has ever 
worked for or had any affiliation with the South Korean Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant speaks to each of his sisters one or two times a year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens and residents of South Korea.  His father- in-law was a senator from South Korea, but he is 75 years old, and he has been 
retired for many years.  Applicant's mother- in-law  was a homemaker.  Applicant may speak to his in-laws one time a year; his wife talks to them one time a 
month. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's wife also was born in South Korea. She came to the United States in approximately 1987, and she became a naturalized U. S. Citizen in June 2004. 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">came to the United States, he has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">traveled to South Korea on five occasions from 1996 to his last visit in April 2003.  The primary reason for 
these visits was to see his family, and to attend family weddings, including his own. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was not aware of receiving any inheritance or other financial interest from South Korea.  He has estimated his financial holdings in this country to be 
worth $670,000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> introduced letters from his supervisor and a co-worker. Both individuals indicated that they believed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was honest, trustworthy and reliable 
(Exhibits A and B). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant, I conclude the 
following with respect to Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are citizens and residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> South Korea, and his sisters reside in Korea. The South Korean citizenship and residency of 
Applicant's family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in 
rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a 
security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of existence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens of and reside in South Korea comes within DC (E2.A2.1.2.1), immediate family 
members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the lack of South Korean government involvement of Applicant's parents, 
sisters and other family members, currently and in the past, the fact that his wife is now a United States citizen, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his devotion to his children,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> his history since 
coming to the United States,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and his strong feelings concerning this country,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I have determined that his family in South Korea do not constitute an unacceptable 
security risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) (E2.A2.1.3.1.), a determination that the immediate family members in question are not agents of a foreign power 
or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United 
States, applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B , I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting 
the SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
