<P>This 33-year-old computer technician incurred five delinquent debts when his wife became pregnant and had to stop working for an extended period.  He 
considered filing for bankruptcy several years ago, but did not do so because he thought his wife would be able to return to work and they could pay off the 
debts.  Her return to work has been delayed and Applicant became aware that his debts had caused security concerns.  This led him to file for bankruptcy 
protection and a Discharge of his debts was issued in January 2004.  Applicant is now current with his monthly operating expenses and has no delinquent debts.  
Financial rehabilitation has been established. Mitigation has ben shown.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On December 3, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge on the written record, i.e., without a hearing.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 24, 2004, and Applicant 
received  it on February 18, 2003.  The Form instructed Applicant that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of its receipt by 
Applicant.  The response was due on March 21, 2003.  Applicant did not submit any response to the FORM.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on 
arch 25, 2003.  Upon examination of the file, I noticed a letter from an attorney, dated in 2003, stating that Applicant was going to file for bankruptcy 
protection and a copy of a Discharge of Debtor Order dated January 28, 2004.  However there was nothing in the case file indicating that a Discharge in 
Bankruptcy had been granted.  It was decided to allow Applicant additional time to obtain and submit documents showing the details in question.  Appellant 
hereafter timely submitted a copy of the Discharge of Debtors by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, dated January 28, 2004 (Appellant's Exhibit A). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old computer technician for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. - 1.e., under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant<EM> admits</EM> all five of the SOR allegations, with the comment that "all the above issues have been resolved 
through the bankruptcy process" Government Exhibit (GX) 3.  All of Applicant's admissions are incorporated into this decision as FINDINGS OF FACT.  
After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the FORM, including but not limited to Applicant's response to the SOR, I make the following 
additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</P> 
 
<P>1.a. - Applicant was indebted to Hospital A in the approximate amount of $140.00,which was turned over for collection in December 2002.</P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant was indebted to Bank B in the approximate amount of $2,953.00 for a delinquent debt that was charged off as a bad debt in December 2000.</P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Applicant was indebted to Hospital C in the approximate amount of $168.00 for a delinquent account that was turned over for collection in June 2001.</P> 
 
<P>1.d. - Applicant was indebted to Company D in the approximate amount of $5,583.00 for a delinquent account that was charged off in September 2000.</P> 
 
<P>1.e. - Applicant was indebted to Auto Dealer E in the approximate amount of $4,659.00 for a delinquent account that was charged off in July 2000.</P> 
 
<P>In January 2004, all of the above debts were discharged in bankruptcy (AX A and Response to SOR).  The credit report in the case file, dated 12/17/2001 (GX 
7) is the source of the five delinquent debts cited in the SOR.  No other delinquent debts are shown in the credit report and Applicant is able to handle his 
current finances without apparent problems.  The Personal Financial Statement (PFS) of November 14, 2001, attached to Applicant's Sworn Statement of 
November 28, 2002 (GX 5) indicates that Applicant is financially capable of paying his current expenses. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden 
(either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>This 33 year old Applicant's financial problems substantially appeared in the late 1990s/early 2000s when his wife became pregnant, had twins, and was forced 
to quit her job.  Medical bills and an auto accident added financial stress.  The couple were no longer able to keep current on their debts.  Applicant 
acknowledged the problem by voluntarily returning their truck.  Applicant and his wife considered filing for bankruptcy protection several years ago, but 
decided not do so in the expectation that his wife would be able to return to work and they could pay off their debts.  This has not occurred, so they decided 
recently to go ahead with the bankruptcy, so they could make a fresh start.  Applicant has not incurred any debts in addition to those cited in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P>Bases in the entire record, I have evaluated the evidence in the context of the relevant Disqualifying (DC) and Mitigating (MC) Conditions for Financial 
Considerations.  DC 1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are applicable.  MC 1 and MC 2 are 
not applicable in that the delinquent debts are still recent and cannot be considered an isolated incident.  However, I also conclude that the MC 3 - conditions 
that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of wife's employment, and unexpected medical emergency and expenses) is 
applicable, as is MC 6 -the individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  </P> 
 
<P>There is no evidence of extravagant spending or a lifestyle beyond their means.  Although they have shown an ability to handle current operating expenses, it is 
clearly beyond their ability to repay the delinquent debts.  Under these circumstances, I conclude that filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 was a 
responsible means of resolving those debts.  Bankruptcy is a valid, legal, and recognized method of ending legal responsibility for discharged debts and is of 
security significance only if done in a way that indicates advance planning, excessive use/multiple filings, or other conduct that suggests questionable judgment, 
unreliability, and/or untrustworthiness.  None of that is suggested by the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F (Financial Consideration)  For the Applicant </P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.               For the Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.                For the Applicant</P> 
 
<P>             Subparagraph 1.c.               For the Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent</P> 
 
<P>with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>
