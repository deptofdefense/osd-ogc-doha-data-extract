<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 9, 2001, Applicant entered a plea of no contest to the offense of evading arrest</P> 
 
<P>or detention, a Class B misdemeanor.  Adjudication was deferred for one  year and he was placed on community supervision (probation) for twelve months.  
The offense resulted from Applicant fleeing from a police officer who was attempting to stop him for a speeding violation.  He successfully completed the 
period of his probation and the charges were dismissed on April 23, 2003.  Applicant has led a law-abiding life, with the exception of a number of prior traffic 
offenses, and is otherwise considered to be a responsible individual of high moral character.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 29, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct based upon Applicant's 2001 deferred adjudication and 12 month probationary 
sentence for Evading Arrest with a Vehicle (a Class A misdemeanor)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was sworn to on November 22, 2002, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a 
hearing.  Applicant denied he pled no contest to the offense as alleged in the SOR, but admitted he pled no contest to Evading Arrest (a Class B misdemeanor) 
and was placed on probation and fined.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 26, 2003 that was mailed to Applicant on April 3, 2003.  Applicant, through 
counsel, submitted a written response to the FORM that was received by DOHA on May 19, 2003.  Applicant's response to the FORM contained five exhibits 
and four character reference letters.  Department Counsel indicated she did not object to the admissibility of Applicant's response or the attachments thereto.       
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admission to the sole allegation in the SOR is incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits and 
character reference letters, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 23-years-old, single, and a recent college graduate.  He was employed by a defense contractor as a "coop student" while he attended college, and 
obtained full-time employment with the same contractor following his graduation.  He is considered to be a responsible employee who has had routine access to 
classified information during his employment without incurring any security violations.  He is viewed by his supervisors as a dedicated and hard-working 
employee who is a "team player."  He has earned a reputation of being of high moral character outside work.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On September 2, 2001, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Applicant was driving his automobile at a speed of 95mph in a 65mph speed limit zone.  Upon seeing a 
police car traveling in the opposite direction, Applicant exited the highway, executed several turns in an attempt to elude the pursuing police officer, and 
eventually parked his vehicle in a field in a further effort to hide from the officer.  Applicant was arrested and charged with Evading Arrest (a Class B 
misdemeanor).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant entered a plea of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>no contest </EM>to the charge of Evading Arrest on November 9, 2001.  The proceedings were thereupon deferred without entering an 
adjudication of guilt and Applicant was placed on community supervision for a period of 12 months.  Included as conditions of the community supervision were 
requirements that Applicant report to a community supervision office, pay a fine in the amount of $850.00, pay court costs and fees, perform 80 hours of 
community service restitution, not commit any new offenses and report any new arrests to his supervision officer.  Applicant successfully completed the 
community supervision, including all conditions imposed incident thereto, and an order dismissing the case was entered on April 25, 2003.  The Community 
Supervision Officer assigned to Applicant's case opined that he had learned a valuable lesson from his experience on community supervision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant had been issued approximately 10 speeding tickets between the time he began driving at the age of 16 in 1996 and when he was arrested for 
the above offense, his driving privilege was never suspended or revoked.  While he exited highways on two or three occasions when he thought police officers 
might be about to stop him for speeding violations, he never did so, with the exception of the above arrest, when he knew he was about to actually be stopped.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chiefs among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-14539.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets.  A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J.  The evidence establishes that he did commit the offense of Evading Arrest (a 
Class B misdemeanor), and was placed on community supervision for a period of 12 months.  Additionally, Applicant had previously received numerous 
speeding citations, although his driving privileges were never suspended or revoked.  The evading arrest charge originated from yet another speeding violation 
being committed by Applicant.  Although Applicant exited highways on two or three prior occasions when he thought he might be stopped by police for 
speeding, there is no evidence that Applicant ever actually evaded arrest in a legal sense on a prior occasion.  DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's numerous speeding violations and sole criminal arrest all occurred when he was between 16 and 21 years of age.  The last reported offense of any 
type committed by Applicant was the arrest for evading arrest in 2001.  Conditions of Applicant's community supervision sentence were that he "commit no 
offenses against the laws of this or any other State or the United States" and "report any new arrest to the supervision officer in writing within 48 hours."  The 
judge who entered the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>ORDER DISCHARGING DEFENDANT FROM PROBATION AND DISMISSING PROCEEDINGS </EM>on April 23, 2003 made a specific 
finding that Applicant had successfully completed all of the terms and conditions of his probation, allowing for an affirmative conclusion that he has not 
committed any offenses subsequent to his September 2, 2001 arrest, until at least the date of the order.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, Applicant was a 21-year-old college student at the time of the arrest.  He has now graduated from college and began a full-time career.  The 
character reference letters attest to his work ethic, sense of responsibility, and outstanding moral character.  Further, the community supervision officer charged 
with monitoring his conduct while on community supervision has opined that Applicant has learned the valuable lesson from his experience on supervision that 
the court surely intended.  Considering Applicant's youthful age and student status at the time of the arrest on September 2, 2001, I find the intervening two 
years and the substantial change in his status sufficient to conclude that MC 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM> applies in this case.  There also is 
sufficient evidence in the record to find that MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>applies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence of record in this case, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns caused by his criminal conduct.  He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.  
Guideline J is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
