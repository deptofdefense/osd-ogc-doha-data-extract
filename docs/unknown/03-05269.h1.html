<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant falsified a statement to an official Government investigator in January 2000 concerning his use of marijuana five times between 1996 and 1998.  
The Applicant did not falsify a statement in February 2000 or a questionnaire in October 2001.  Sufficient mitigation is shown.  Adverse inference is overcome.  
Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 26, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 18, 2004, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The Department Counsel 
submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on August 2, 2004.  The Applicant was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit 
any additional information to the Administrative Judge.  The Applicant acknowledged receipt the FORM on August 5, 2004, and elected not to submit any 
additional information.  The case was received by the undersigned for Decision on November 1, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 34, married and has a Bachelor of Science.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Analyst, and he seeks to obtain DoD security 
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 5, 2000, the Applicant stated to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) that he had used marijuana from 1984 to August 1996 on an 
occasional basis.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 1-2.)  This was a false statement as the Applicant actually used marijuana until August 1998, using it five times in 
the intervening two years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was subsequently re-interviewed by a Special Agent of the DSS on February 9, 2000.  The SOR at subparagraph 1.b. states that the Applicant 
denied using marijuana after August 1997 when he actually used it until August 1998.  This is in error.  The Applicant states, "I smoked marijuana about five 
times at the most from Aug 96 to Aug 98.  The last time I smoked marijuana was in Aug 98 while attending a concert . . .  I have not used marijuana or any 
illegal drug after Aug 98."  (Government Exhibit 7 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the same statement, the Applicant admitted falsifying his statement of one month earlier.  He stated that he did this, "because I was concerned that I could 
lose my job."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an official questionnaire completed by the Applicant on October 15, 2001, he stated that he had used marijuana 10 times in the year 1995.  (Government 
Exhibit 4, question 27.)  However, he goes on to state immediately below in "Remarks," "I don't recall actual dates and [occurrences].  I signed statements 
during my previous investigation stating the dates and [occurrences]."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As found above, the Applicant knowingly and willfully provided false material information to DoD during the clearance screening process on January 5, 2000.  
In so doing the Applicant violated the felony criminal provisions of 18 USC 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  The applicable Mitigating and Disqualifying Conditions under the Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct 
concerns will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS, below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of falsification and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant intentionally made false material statements to DoD, 
in violation of a felony criminal statute (Guidelines E and J).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  First of all, it is clear that the Applicant falsified only one statement, that 
of January 2000.  His statement in February 2000 was accurate and subparagraph 1.b. is obviously incorrect.  In addition, on the questionnaire the Applicant 
completed in October 2001 (subparagraph 1.c.) the Applicant clearly states that he did not recall the actual dates and that the Government should look at his 
earlier statements.  Accordingly, the Government was put on notice of the possibility that his answers on this questionnaire were incorrect.  Accordingly, there 
was no falsification of this questionnaire.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What is left is that the Applicant five years ago concealed from the Government that he had used marijuana five times between 1996 and 1998, seven to nine 
years ago.  Under Guideline E Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.3 applies (<EM>deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and 
material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination</EM>).  However, Mitigating Condition E2.A5.1.3.2 also applies (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the 
individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>).  It is also noted under the whole person concept that the statement where the Applicant 
truthfully discusses his drug use was taken only a month after the first.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J also applies to this single incident of falsification five years ago.  Specifically, Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admissions of 
criminal conduct; regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>).  The facts of this case also support the application of Mitigating Conditions 
E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>); and E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant false statement to an investigator in January 2000 is not to be minimized.  However, it was five years ago, concerned the use of marijuana on five 
occasions between 1996 and 1998, and his subsequent statements have been truthful.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, it is concluded that the 
Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding 
for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
