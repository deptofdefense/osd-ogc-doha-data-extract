<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant wilfully misrepresented his marijuana use on clearance applications in October 1995, June and December 1999, and April 2002, and during a subject 
interview in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 1999, rendering him an unsuitable candidate for access to classified information. He also used marijuana while holding a clearance. 
Clearance denied.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 21 November 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or 
revocation of his clearance because of drug involvement and personal conduct.<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He answered the SOR 22 December 2003, and requested a hearing. DOHA 
assigned the case to me 15 July 2004 and I heard it 27 August 2004. DOHA received the transcript 2 September 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 30-year-old installer employed by a defense 
contractor since November 2000. He previously had a clearance while in the U.S. Navy from 1996 to 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his admissions, Applicant concedes that he misrepresented his drug abuse history on clearance applications in October 1995,<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> June and December 1999,<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and 
April 2002,<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and during a December 1999 subject interview with the Defense Security Service.<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He admits using marijuana with varying frequency from March 
1993 to December 1991, at times when he held a clearance. These admissions are consistent with his June 2002 sworn statement (G.E. 5)<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and his answer to the 
SOR<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>. Unfortunately, his admissions are also inconsistent with his answer<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and his testimony at hearing.<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> At hearing, he acknowledged the credibility issues 
raised by his inconsistent statements (Tr. 56) and conceded that he would not believe his own statements of lower levels of drug use under the circumstances 
(Tr. 64). The record otherwise lacks evidence of Applicant's work history or character references.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline H case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. Although his last marijuana use was in December 2001, his drug 
use while cleared raises particular concerns about his suitability for a clearance.<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> While he now vows to remain drug free that vow is less credible given 
Applicant's conflicting statements about the extent of his drug use and thus insufficient to demonstrate intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future. 
Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also established a Guideline E </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately misrepresented his drug history on four 
clearance applications over seven years and during a subject interview.<A HREF="02-27899.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His explanations are not credible, and indeed conflicting, and I conclude he intended to 
conceal this information from both the government and  his employer.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. 
Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security 
violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of 
classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
