<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 6 January 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-06926.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-06926.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-Applicant failed to 
meet the financial considerations (Guideline F), personal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J) personnel security guidelines of the 
Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 17 January 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to 
me on 12 June 2003.  The SOR was amended without objection on 30 June 2003.  On 17 July 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 24 July 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate who is the senior technical manager over the technical teams that work on the service-wide intranet at all 
installations of one of the armed services.  </P> 
 
<P>In the 1980s, Applicant owned three gas stations and leased another in State 2.  He did very well financially.  In 1987, he decided to sell them and try his hand 
at another business.  Gasoline was found in the ground and in the water table under his stations.  This environmental problem caused considerable expense, 
delay in the sale of the properties, and resulted in financial difficulties for Applicant.  Tr. 19-24.  From 1991-96, he was self-employed in State 2.  Ex. 1 at 4.  
He had always been fascinated by computers, and toward the end of the 1990s, he moved to State 1 and took courses to gain certifications that permitted him to 
enter the computer field.  Tr. 25-28.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on 3 October 2001.  Question 36 asked if, in the last seven years, Applicant had a lien placed 
against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts.  Question 38 asked if, in the last seven years, Applicant had been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debts.  Applicant answered "no" to both questions.  The following chart summarizes each of the financial issues raised in the SOR and their current status.</P>

<P>On 27 November 2001, a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) interviewed Applicant about his financial situation.  Ex. 2.  Applicant completed 
a signed, sworn statement on that date in which he admitted debts 2 and 3 (see chart) and said he would pay them immediately.  Applicant also completed a 
financial statement which showed he had a monthly net remainder of $3,367 after all of his bills were paid.  It also listed as delinquent his total debt to the IRS 
($150,000) and his debts to the doctor and hospital noted in the chart as 2 and 3.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had debts to creditors he had not satisfied (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.d.), debts he owed the IRS for his personal income taxes (&para;&para; 1.e.-1.j), 
federal tax liens against his property (&para;&para; 1.k.-1.l.), employment taxes owed the IRS for several years (&para; 1.m.), unpaid personal state income taxes (&para; 1.n.), and 
unpaid state business taxes (&para; 1.o.).  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; 
E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant established that Debts 14 and 15 (see chart) were tax liabilities that should not have been assessed against him.  Exs. G, Q, R, S.  Finding is for 
Applicant on SOR &para;&para; 1.n. and 1.o.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  DC 1.  He still has not resolved his federal income tax deficiencies for years 1992-97.  He was 
unable or unwilling to satisfy debts.  DC 2.  Even after Applicant told the DSS agent that he would immediately pay his delinquent medical bills, he did not do 
so.  Despite having a monthly net remainder of $3,367, he failed to pay the delinquent medical bills, totaling only $251, until after he received the SOR-some 
13 months later.  Much of his original financial problems can be traced to conditions that were largely beyond his control (MC 3)-the inability to sell his gas 
stations without costly environmental cleanup.  Yet, even from Applicant's own exhibits, it is clear that he is still unable or unwilling to meet his financial 
obligations.  Applicant still owes the IRS $3,679 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for the 2002 tax year.  Ex. V.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose the tax liens that had been placed against his property (&para; 2.a.) and the 
debts that, in the past seven years, were over 180 days delinquent (&para; 2.b.).  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  
Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.</P> 
 
<P>It is a disqualifying condition to deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts from an SCA.  DC 1.  Applicant asserts he never deliberately 
failed to disclose any information on his SCA.  Tr. 12.  He admits knowing there was a tax lien against him, but he claims he thought it was not filed more than 
seven years before he completed the SCA.  Two federal tax liens totaling over $70,000 were filed against Applicant on 2 December 1996, less than five years 
before he completed the SCA.  Six months before completing his SCA, Applicant filed an offer and compromise with the IRS for tax liabilities that he incurred 
from 1992-1997.  Under all of the circumstances, I am convinced he knew these debts were incurred in the previous seven years and he deliberately omitted 
them from his SCA.  Although the deliberate falsification was an isolated incident, it was recent.  Therefore, MC 2 does not apply.  None of the other mitigating 
conditions under this guideline apply to Applicant's case.  Finding is against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant committed criminal acts by willfully failing to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1998 and 1999(&para;&para; 3.a.-3.b.), falsifying his answers to questions 36 and 38 on his SCA (&para; 3.c.), and failing to file his state income tax returns for tax years 1997-2000 and 2002 (&para;&para; 3.d.-3.h.).  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203, it is a criminal offense (misdemeanor) for any person required to file an income tax return to willfully fail to do so.  Ex. 8.  Applicant 
failed to file income tax returns for tax years 1998 and 1999.  He claims he was not required to file because he did not earn sufficient income.  There is no 
evidence of record to support a contrary conclusion.  Finding is for Applicant on &para;&para; 3.a. and 3.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a felony to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of 
the executive.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001(a)(2).  Applicant denies that his failure to correctly answer questions 36 and 38 on his SCA was knowing and willful.  
Applicant knowingly and willfully failed to answer these questions correctly.  Both questions were relevant and material to the granting of a security clearance.  
These are serious criminal offenses punishable by up to five years confinement and a $10,000 fine.  <EM>See </EM>DC 2.  The falsifying of his SCA was an isolated 
incident.  MC 2.  After weighing all the evidence, the mitigating condition is not sufficient to outweigh the disqualifying condition.  Finding is against 
Applicant on &para; 3.c.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In State 1, it is a felony for any person required to file a tax return to knowingly fail to do so.  Ex. 7.  The Government introduced evidence from the State 
Department of Taxation that Applicant failed to file tax returns for tax years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002.  Ex. 5.  Applicant claims that he did not have 
sufficient income to require him to file in any of those years, except 2002.  He filed his 2002 State tax return, albeit several months late.  Ex. H.  Under the 
circumstances, the evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant's conduct was criminal.  Finding is for Applicant on &para;&para; 3.d.-3.h.</SPAN></P>
