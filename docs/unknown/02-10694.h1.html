<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor has an admitted history of criminal and other misconduct on at least 11 occasions, beginning in 1995 and 
continuing until at least 2001, an average of almost two a year. Mitigation has not been adequately established.  Clearance is denied.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 8, 2003, Applicant submitted two responses to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA 
Administrative Judge on the written record, i.e., without a hearing. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 4, 2004.  The 
Form instructed Applicant that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of its receipt by Applicant.  Applicant received the FORM on 
February 17, 2004.  Any response was due by March 18, 2004, but no submission to the FORM has been received.  The matter was assigned to me for 
resolution on April 2, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 28-year-old information security specialist for a defense contractor.  The July 17, 2003 SOR contains one allegation under Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) and 10 allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct - Falsifications). In his two September 8, 2003 responses (Items 2 and 3) to the SOR (Item 
1), Applicant denies (without explanation) allegation 1.a.; he admits the amount and status of the debt cited in allegation 1.b. The admitted allegations are 
accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the FORM and its attachments, including Applicant's two responses to the SOR, I make the 
following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - On February 2, 1998, Applicant was charges with Disorderly Conduct.  A warrant was issued for his arrest and he was charged with for jumping bail on 
arch 12, 1998. He was found guilty on September 17, 1998, sentenced, served two days, and was placed on house arrest. He was found guilty of Disorderly 
Conduct on December 2, 1998 and was sentenced to seven days home incarceration with credit for time served.  He was fined $100.00 and court costs;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. - On August 31, 2001, Applicant was arrested for speeding. He pleaded guilty.  He was charged with court costs that were to be paid within a specified 
period. He requested and received state traffic school in lieu of a fine. As of December 2001, he had not satisfied either penalty.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b. - On August 3, 1999, Applicant was cited for speeding and failure to wear a seat belt. He was found guilty of speeding and fined $20.00 plus court costs 
and found guilty of not wearing a set belt and fined $25.00;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.c. - The facts cited in SOR 1.a., above;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.d. - On November 11, 1998, Applicant was cited or speeding and failure  to wear a seat belt. He was found guilty on both counts, ordered to pay court costs 
on both charges, and ordered to attend state traffic school;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.e. - On October 15, 1998, Applicant was arrested for Alcohol Intoxication.  He entered a not guilty plea and on December 2, 1998, the charges were 
dismissed at a pretrial conference;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.f. - On March 20, 1997, Applicant was cited for Improper Signal and an Expired Driver's License.  Both charges were dismissed on May 31, 1996;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.g. - On December 30, 1996, Applicant was cited for Minor in Possession of Alcohol.  He was found guilty and paid a fine of $25.00 and costs;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.h. - On September 5, 1995, Applicant was cited for speeding.  He pleaded guilty and was fined $25.00 and costs;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.i.. - On March 12, 1995, Applicant was cited fore Minor in Possession of Alcohol. He was found guilty and was fined $25.00 and court costs;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.j. - Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application (SCA), dated December 4, 1999, in response to Question <STRONG>24  Your Police Record - 
Alcohol/Drug Offenses, </STRONG>when he deliberately failed to disclose the facts as listed in SOR 2g. and 2.i.,  Minor in Possession of Alcohol, which occurred when 
he was 19 and 20 years old. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several of Applicant's friends and work colleagues view him as an "honest and trustworthy individual who refuses to compromise [his] integrity" and "a 
mature and responsible individual at all times" (Attachments to Item 3).. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
(Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment 
and conduct.  Because Applicant chose to have this matter decided without a hearing and without submitting any additional information in response to the 
FORM, all credibility determinations and findings of fact are necessarily based entirely on the contents of the FORM and applicant's response.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to 
speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, 
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses, here based solely on the written record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  
These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  
concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
demonstrate that, despite the existence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant. I find that the financial issues in question do raise security concerns under Directive Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to the contents of the various documents that are found in the case file, 
the latest of which are Applicant's two responses to the SOR on September 28, 2003.  In those responses, Applicant admits the single criminal conduct 
allegation, SOR 1.a.  and  all personal conduct allegations except for SOR 2.j., wherein he denies the deliberate falsification of his answer to Question 24.  I 
have carefully considered his explanations for the falsification (Item 3) and conclude that while he denies any deliberate falsification, he really doesn't provide 
any alternative rationale that might be considered credible and mitigating.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Overall, the evidence of record establishes as a man of 28 with an unfortunate history of the exercise of poor conduct going back almost nine years. From 1995 
to August 2001, he has been cited, arrested, convicted, and/or sentenced on nine separate occasions for offenses ranging from speeding and not wearing a seat 
belt to disorderly conduct and bail jumping. He began his history of criminal and other misconduct as a young man but he has continued it until, at least, after 
the submission of his security clearance application in 1999 and shortly before he competed his sworn statement to an agent of the Defense Security Service in 
December 2001. The overall record is not one that inspires confidence in Applicant's integrity, judgment reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged) and 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) are clearly applicable.  None of the listed possible Mitigating Conditions have been 
established by the record since the misconduct is not isolated, is still recent, and there is no clear evidence of rehabilitation (MC 1, 2, and 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Likewise, under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the record shows both a deliberate falsification of material facts on his security clearance and a history and 
pattern of conduct that reflects poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. None of the possible mitigating conditions listed in the guidelines has been 
established.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Overall, without questioning Applicant's sincerity, he simply has not overcome the negative impact of his long and trouble history of violating laws, rules and 
regulations that govern all of us. Much of this misconduct occurred after Applicant received a DoD security clearance in 1993 (Item 6 at Question 23). Pursuant 
to the requirements established in the Directive, Applicant has not yet demonstrated that his past misconduct is at an end and that he can be relied upon to avoid 
any future recurrence. For these reasons, and not withstanding the positive input from his two colleagues, the record compels the conclusion that Applicant has 
not7yet established his eligibility for access to the nation's secrets,  </SPAN></P>
