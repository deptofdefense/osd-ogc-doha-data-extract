<P>Applicant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that her parents and parents-in-law, who are citizens and residents of China, are not in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power.  She and her husband maintain weekly contact with both her parents and parents-in-law.  Both Applicant's parents and parents-in-law receive pensions from the Chinese government.  They have visited Applicant and her husband on more than one occasion pursuant to visas authorized by 
the Chinese government.  Applicant and her husband have also traveled to China to visit them.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-23885.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-23885.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR states that DOHA was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information and recommends that her case be submitted to an 
Administrative Judge.</P> 
<P>On August 26, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued 
on February 20, 2004 and the hearing was held on March 3, 2004.  During the hearing, two Government exhibits (Govt Ex), two Applicant exhibits (Ap Ex), 
and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses, including Applicant, were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on March 9, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 39-year-old senior software engineer who is employed by a government contractor.  She was born in the People's Republic of China (China).  
Applicant received an undergraduate degree in engineering and was employed by the China Textile Institute, a governmental organization, from 1988-1990 
(SOR &para; 1.g).</P> 
<P>Applicant married a software engineer, a citizen and resident of China, and they relocated to the United States in 1990 because  her husband's employment.  
They have two children, both of whom were born in the United States.  Applicant received further education in the United States in English, finance, and 
information technology, before obtaining her current position.  Her husband became a citizen of the United States in 1999 and she became a U.S. citizen in June 
2000.</P> 
<P>On February 5, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).  Following an interview with a Defense security Service (DSS) special 
agent, Applicant renounced her Chinese citizenship and surrendered her Chinese passport.  On May 30, 2002, Applicant provided a sworn statement to the same 
DSS special agent in which she said: "if I come across something that might hurt my family simply because of their geographical location, I would consider 
making up a story to get them away from that location as to prevent any harm from coming to them" (SOR &para; 1.h).</P> 
<P>In 1994, Applicant returned to China with her daughter for a three month visit with family and friends.  In 2001, she returned there with her husband and 
children for a three week visit that included a three day trip to Tokyo (SOR &para; 1.f). </P> 
<P>Applicants parents are citizens and residents of China.  They are both in their seventies and are retired.  Applicant's father was a professor and her mother was 
an engineer.  Both worked for the government and receive pensions.  Applicant is their only child and maintains weekly contact with them by telephone.  They 
visited her for approximately six months in 1996-97 and for approximately one year in 1999-2000 (SOR &para; 1.a).</P> 
<P>Applicants parents-in-law are citizens and residents of China.  They are both retired and receive pensions from their jobs with the government.  Applicant and 
her husband maintain weekly contact with them by telephone.  Her parents-in-law visited them for approximately six months in 1995 and for approximately one 
year in 1998 (SOR &para; 1.b).  </P> 
<P>Applicant has a cousin who is a citizen and resident of China and works for the Chinese Treasury Department.  She sees her cousin once a year during the 
cousin's annual business trip to the United States.  Applicant's cousin lived in the United States in 1996-1999 while working for the World Bank.  Applicant 
had monthly contact with her cousin's husband, a Chinese citizen, when he worked in the United States in 2001-2002 (SOR &para; 1.d).    </P> 
<P>Applicant has relatives and friends who are citizens and residents of China with whom she generally maintains contact no more than once a year (SOR &para; 1.c).  
She has other relatives and friends who are citizens of China, Taiwan, or Canada and who currently reside in the United States.  She maintains contact with 
them every few months (SOR &para; 1.e).</P> 
<P>The People's Republic of China is a totalitarian communist regime who's interests are inimical to those of the United States.  China has conducted extensive 
political, military, and economic espionage against the United States.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish  facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guideline is applicable to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B: Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to 
security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include E2.A2.1.2.1,  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country (Disqualifying Condition 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">They also include E2.A2.1.2.3, relatives, co-habitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government (Disqualifying Condition 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A2.1.3.1, a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters) co-habitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States (Mitigating Condition 1).  They also include 
E2.A2.1.3.3, contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent (Mitigating Condition 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given the pervasive role of the government in China, Applicant's relatives and friends who are citizens and residents of China may include those who are 
connected to the government.  This raises Disqualifying Condition 3.  However, Applicant's contact with these persons is generally no more than once a year 
and is therefore mitigated in accordance with Mitigating Condition 3.  Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's contact with relatives and friends, who are citizens of China, Taiwan, or Canada and currently reside in the United States, is generally more often 
than once a year. However, it is still casual and infrequent in accordance with Mitigating Condition 3.  Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to 
SOR &para; 1.e.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's employment by the China Textile Institute occurred before she came to the United States and became a U.S. citizen.  The record fails to establish a 
disqualifying condition with respect to that employment.  The same is true with respect to her statement to a DSS special agent (SOR &para; 1.h).  Therefore, I find 
in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.g and h.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and parent-in-law, with whom she maintains close ties, are both citizens and residents  of China.  All of them live on pensions provided by 
the Chinese government, a government that has abused its own citizens and that is engaged in espionage against the United States.  This establishes 
Disqualifying Condition 1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the record does not indicate that any of them are agents of a foreign power, it fails to demonstrate that they are not in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power.  To the contrary,  Applicant's parents and parents-in-law are reliant upon retirement income from the Chinese government.  They have visited 
Applicant and her husband on more than one occasion pursuant to visas authorized by the Chinese government.  Applicant and her husband have also traveled 
to China to visit them.  Such exposure could leave them vulnerable to exploitation by a foreign power which has not been hesitant to treat its citizens harshly in 
order to further its own ends.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant relies on decisions of Administrative Judges in other ISCR cases in support of her application.  Although such decisions may be cited as persuasive 
authority, they are not legally binding on an Administrative Judge in another case.  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 4.  Security clearance 
adjudications are individualized determinations where the Administrative Judge is duty bound to apply the law as represented by the Adjudicative Guidelines to 
the facts of the particular case in keeping with the "whole person" concept.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there is no basis in the record to question Applicant's character and integrity, the DOHA Appeal Board has recognized that "an applicant with good 
character and personal integrity can pose a security risk because the applicant has close relatives in a country hostile to the United States."  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002) at p. 8.  Family ties in a foreign country raise a prima facie security concern that requires the applicant "to present evidence of 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 99-0532 (February 27, 2001) at p. 6.  This is especially critical given the espionage effort against the United States in which the 
People's Republic of China is engaged and the threat to the national interest of the United States that it represents.  Applicant has failed to meet her burden of 
persuasion in this case.  Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.a and b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's relationship with a cousin, who is employed by the Chinese government, raises Disqualifying Condition 3.  It also appears more than casual 
because of Applicant's direct contact with her every year.  Her returns visits to China make her more vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by the 
Chinese government and raise Disqualifying Condition 6.  The record fails to mitigate these concerns.  At best it leaves doubt that must be resolved against 
Applicant in accordance with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the Directive.  Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.d and f. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
