<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 17, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On June 12, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on June 30, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), dated September 8, 2006, was provided to him on September 11, 2006, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Any such submissions were due by October 11, 2006.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant provided additional materials in response to the FORM, which were received on October 10, 2006.  Department Counsel 
did not object to Applicant's additional materials.  The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 17, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend SOR &para; 1.a, changing  the date of Applicant's arrest from "[o]n or about May 24, 2004," to "sometime in May 1994."  Department 
Counsel's basis for the amendment is to conform the allegation to Applicant's statement of October 18, 2004.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not object to the amendment.  Department Counsel's motion is granted.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant made some admissions, and denied other allegations in his response to the SOR.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.   Under Guideline 
F, Applicant admitted that he was aware of and responsible for the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b, but asserted they were both paid through a debt consolidation plan.  For SOR &para;&para; 2.a to 2.d, Applicant 
admitted the allegations.  However, he contended that he had decreased his consumption of alcohol, and does not drive after consuming excessive alcohol.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> employee of a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> From 1995 to 2003, he was never unemployed.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> From 1978 to 1979, he attended college, and was awarded an AAS degree.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
Applicant has no prior military service.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married to his current spouse on November 24, 1979.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has three children and three stepchildren.</SPAN><A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 1.a involves a revolving credit card debt of $630.00 owed to M, and states this debt was delinquent and ultimately charged off.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant credibly counters that his payments were timely on 
this debt, and that he paid it using a debt consolidation company, DS.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  M's debt  amounted to $27,241.33, when it was consolidated with three other debts for DS' administration.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  DS subsequently 
transferred administration or collection of M's debt to W &amp; A.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  There was an arbitration concerning M's debt, followed by negotiations.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  In response to Applicant's post-SOR request for proof of 
payment, W &amp; A provided a letter dated July 25, 2005, indicating W &amp; A offered to settle M's debt for $12,193.06 provided Applicant paid an initial sum of $5,193.06 and $875.00 per month 
thereafter.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  A document from DS' website showed that a debt of $23,499.34 owed to W &amp; A was settled and "Paid In Full."<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no paper trail corroborating Applicant's statement that he paid the debt to C in SOR &para; 1.b using a debt consolidation loan from DS.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  The documentation Applicant provided has information 
about debt B,<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> but the letter from B does not list C as the source of the debt, nor does it include an account number, or the total amount of the debt being settled.  He also received a settlement 
document from HFC offering to settle a debt for one payment of $1,750.00 on May 1, 2002.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  The HFC letter did not indicate a particular account number, or whether the loan was related to C.  I 
accept Applicant's statement as credible that he ultimately used a debt consolidation program that DS administered to pay HFC.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  A document from DS' website showed that debts of $4,981.78 owed 
to HFC and $5,225.31 owed to B were settled and "Paid In Full."<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 2, 2004, Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) to a security investigator.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  His PFS indicates his gross salary was $4,664.64 per month, and net salary was $3,510.00 per

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking alcohol when he was around the age of 13 years.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  He drinks beer to relax and because he likes its taste.  He usually drinks four times a week, and sometimes drinks alcohol 
to intoxication.  However he only gets intoxicated on weekends, which usually involves drinking 8-10 beers.  He gets "loud" when he drinks, and on one occasion the police came to his residence in 
response to a false complaint that he threatened his wife.  His step daughter made this complaint to the police, but the police were unable to obtain his wife's cooperation and no action was taken against 
him.  He attended a 30-day inpatient alcohol treatment program in 1995 or 1996 as part of the agreement with his wife to terminate divorce proceedings.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  He subsequently received some outpatient 
counseling and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for "about a year or so." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1994, Applicant received a ticket for speeding, having an open container of alcohol in his truck, and not having seat belts (SOR &para; 2.a).  Prior to driving, he drank "a few." He was taking "the 
kids" to get something to eat.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  A police officer stopped him for driving 79 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour speed zone.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  He passed a sobriety test.  He paid a fine, and did not go to court. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On or about July 4, 2000, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and reckless endangerment for having children in his vehicle (SOR &para; 2.b).<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Applicant was sentenced 
to 30 days in jail, fined, and his driver's license was suspended.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 18, 2004, Applicant said he planned to cut down on his drinking, his drinking had no effect on his job, and his financial problems were unrelated to his drinking.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  Applicant still drinks 
and drives.  But he explained, "I do not go to bars or anything.  I also use a driver if I have had too much to drive . . . I do not drive when I have had too many as I have a daughter who can drive.  I also 
stay at home and do not go to bars or anything to drink.  Therefore would not have anyone to tell anything to."  I find his statements about his consumption of alcohol to be credible.    </SPAN></P>

<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility for 
access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction with 
the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense 
decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; 
E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: "An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness."</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have 
avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. If the government meets its initial burden, 
applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and 
ultimately to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue applicant's clearance.<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours 
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover 
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN> Applicant's initial failure to pay two debts is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  Under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails or 
refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FC DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not meeting 
his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  FC DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions in 
initially failing to satisfy his outstanding financial obligations give rise to FC DC 1 and 3.  The two debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b became delinquent as a result of Applicant's poor impulse control

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by substantial evidence under FC MC 1 "the behavior was not recent" or under FC MC 2 "it was an isolated incident."  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1, E2.A6.1.3.2.  </SPAN>I considered FC MC 1 and 2, but decided that neither mitigating condition fully applied because there are two <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b, and they were not paid until very 
recently</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not disclose any information to supported consideration of FC MC 3, "the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  His financial difficulties remain largely unexplained.  He remained gainfully employed 
since 1995.  He does not cite any of the enumerated potential conditions that may arise and result in unexpected financial problems.  His comments about lacking financial self-discipline explain why 
the two debts alleged in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b </SPAN>became or remained delinquent, but they do not warrant application of FC MC 3. </P>

</A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline G.  Examination of Applicant's  actions  reveals conduct involving </SPAN>e<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">xcessive alcohol consumption.  </SPAN>The Directive clearly expresses the 
government's concern regarding excessive alcohol consumption in provision <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1, which states, "excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, 
failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness</SPAN>."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption could indicate that the Applicant may 
negligently fail to properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) 1 may arise from <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other 
criminal incidents related to alcohol use</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">)</SPAN>."  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 1994 driving with an open container of alcohol in his vehicle, his inpatient alcohol treatment in the mid-1990's, his 
2000 DUI, his drinking to the level of intoxication, and his continued consumption of alcohol before driving</SPAN> are actions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that raise security concerns. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><A NAME="cp246"></A><A NAME="cp247"></A>Security concerns based on excessive alcohol consumption can be mitigated by establishing by substantial evidence:  Under AC MC 1, the "alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern;" for AC 
C 2, the "problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem;" and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in the case of AC MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3, applicant has shown "positive changes supportive of sobriety."<A HREF="05-10019.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN>However, none of these three mitigating conditions fully apply.  The two alcohol-related driving incidents indicate a pattern.  He continues to drink to intoxication on weekends; and he drives after 
consuming alcohol, both indications of an ongoing problem.  However, some mitigation is shown because the two alcohol-related incidents involving the police are not in close temporal proximity to 
each other, and they are not recent.  Applicant receives some credit because of the absence of evidence that his alcohol use has recently caused him problems with his family, the police or judicial 
authorities.  There is also some evidence about reduction of factors leading to the incidents, or facts supporting a change in Applicant's life circumstances because he has significantly reduced his 
alcohol consumption from the 1990s<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.     </SPAN></P>

</A> 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Directive 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">provision E2.2.1. As noted above, Applicant's history of alcohol abuse, is counterbalanced by his strong desire to avoid judicial intervention, confinement, fines and loss of his driver's license. E2.2.1.1. 
His actions concerning alcohol consumption and the initial delinquent debt situation were knowledgeable and voluntary. E2.2.1.2.<SUP></SUP>  He is 48 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his 
conduct. E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The likelihood of a future DUI or other alcohol-related driving incident is low because six years have elapsed since the last DUI and Applicant credibly indicates he will not drive after 
consuming sufficient alcohol to become intoxicated. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He credibly stated that he had changed his financial habits and now exercises self-disciple and sound financial practices. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing 
the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has </SPAN>mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations 
and alcohol consumption.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Substantial evidence supports Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful
