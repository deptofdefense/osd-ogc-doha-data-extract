<P>Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history  of financial irresponsibility and personal conduct, which includes 
falsification of his security-clearance application. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. </P> 
<P>Applicant initially responded to the SOR on October 29, 2004, but he did not indicate whether he desired a hearing. Applicant was asked to do so, and he 
responded on December 2, 2004, and he indicated he did not wish to have a hearing. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to having nine delinquent 
accounts totaling more than $12,000.00 under Guideline F. Likewise, under Guideline E, Applicant responded as follows: (1) he admitted misrepresenting his 
state of residence to obtain reduced school tuition; (2) he admitted misrepresenting his residential history on his security-clearance application; and (3) he 
admitted not revealing certain delinquent accounts in response to two questions on his security-clearance application, but he denied doing so deliberately and 
says he missed the questions.</P> 
<P>On January 10, 2005, Department Counsel submitted her written case consisting of all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. 
This so-called File of Relevant Material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on January 31, 2005. Applicant did not submit any 
information within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me March 17, 2005. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old unmarried man who is a native-born U.S. citizen. He is currently employed as a document control specialist for an engineering firm. 
He has worked for this company since February 2001.  </P> 
<P>Sometime in 1995, Applicant obtained a driver's license from Maryland by misrepresenting that he was a resident of that state. He did it to attend a community 
college without paying out-of-state tuition.</P> 
<P>In conjunction with his current employment, Applicant completed an application for a  security clearance in July 2001. In response to a question called "Where 
You Have Lived," he indicated he had lived at a certain address in Maryland since August 1995 to present. In response to two questions about whether he had 
financial delinquencies, he indicated he had a delinquent car loan for about $9,000.00.</P> 
<P>In August 2001, a credit report was obtained during the background investigation. In summary, it revealed Applicant had one repossession and seven accounts 
in a collection/charge off status. Also, it revealed Applicant had accounts that were past due, including  one account 90-days past due and two accounts 120-days past due.</P> 
<P>Applicant was interviewed during the background investigation in July 2002, and the interview produced a sworn statement. In it, Applicant admitted losing a 
job in approximately August 2000 and moving to Virginia where he leased an apartment. He stayed there about three months before leaving the apartment, and 
in doing so, he broke the lease. Also, he did not pay the last month's rent. Applicant did not reveal his Virginia residence when completing his security-clearance application. In addition, Applicant admitted owing several creditors more than $10,000.00 in delinquent debt.</P> 
<P>In February 2004, Applicant responded to interrogatories put to him by DOHA. He indicated he had not contacted a credit counseling service, but he had set up 
payment arrangements with his creditors, and he planned to make monthly payments of $75.00 to each creditor. Other than his representation, Applicant did not 
provide documentary proof that he had made such arrangements with his creditors or that he had made any payments to them.</P> 
<P>The October 2004 SOR alleges and Applicant admits he is indebted to nine creditors for more than $12,000.00. Seven accounts are charged-off bad debts and 
there are two collection accounts. Applicant has not provided documentary proof that he has paid or otherwise resolved these accounts.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F. The nine delinquent accounts demonstrate a history of 
not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Also, the same facts and circumstances demonstrate financial 
irresponsibility.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Based on the record evidence, I am unable to conclude he has made a 
good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his indebtedness.<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The evidence does not suggest that Applicant's financial problems are resolved and under 
control. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. Omission of a past arrest or past drug use, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. In 1995, he misrepresented his true state of residence to 
avoid paying out-of-state tuition. When he completed his security-clearance application in 2001, in response to a question about where he had lived, Applicant 
deliberately omitted that he had resided in Virginia for a period of months during 2000. I am not convinced, however, Applicant deliberately omitted 
information about his finances in response to two questions on the security-clearance application. I accept Applicant's explanation that he missed the questions. 
Given these circumstances, DC 2<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and DC 5<A HREF="03-08524.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. Taken together, these two instances indicate a pattern of dishonesty and a pattern of 
misrepresenting the truth.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Falsification of a security-clearance application is a serious matter, and 
it is not easily mitigated or explained away. Indeed, even if Applicant had successfully mitigated the security concern under Guideline F, the falsification of the 
security-clearance application would still be wholly conclusive of this case. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered 
the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
