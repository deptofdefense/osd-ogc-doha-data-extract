<P>On 5 July 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)(Item 1) to Applicant, stating that 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-08420.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On 13 July 2001, Applicant answered the SOR (Item 4) and requested an administrative decision on the record. On 7 
September 2001, Applicant responded to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 13 August 2001; the record in this case 
closed 18 September 2001, the day Department Counsel indicated no objection to the response. The case was originally assigned to a different 
Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to me on 20 September 2001 because of caseload considerations; I received the case the same day, to 
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR (Item 4). Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 27-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From approximately December 1994 to at least 31 December 2000, Applicant remained in the presence of friends/boyfriend who were using 
marijuana, even though she knew using marijuana was illegal, and had been granted an interim clearance on 27 April 2000. From approximately 
December 1994 to 1997, Applicant remained in the presence of friends/former boyfriend who were using speed (amphetamine), acid (LSD), and 
hallucinogenic mushrooms, even though she knew using these drugs was illegal. Applicant intends to continue being present when illegal drugs are 
being used because she sees no national security issue in her being present when illegal drugs are used.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant first described her association with drug users in a sworn statement given to the Defense Security Service on 29 June 2000 (Item 6):</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have never used any illegal substances and do not have intent to do so in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My first exposure with persons who were involved with use of drugs was when I shared an apartment with a coworker, [named]. I don't recall her 
last name. We resided at [named apartment, city, state] from December 1994 to June 1995. I did not list this residence on my security 
questionnaire because of the short duration I resided there. While there, several of our friends and my boyfriend at the time, used drugs. Because 
of noise from the parties we hosted there, complaints were made to and by the management. My boyfriend, who stayed there most of the time, 
was using speed, marijuana, acid and mushrooms. There was also a lot of alcohol use at the parties. I never tried any of these drugs; I was scared 
that if I did, I would like it, so I never did. My boyfriend broke up with me in 1997. I continue to have contact with about five people I knew from 
this period approximately three to four times a year. Some of them continue to use marijuana.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have known my current boyfriend/cohabitant, [named], since elementary school. I have been with him since December 1997. I know he used 
drugs while in college but do not know the details. Every three or four months [he] uses marijuana when we attend small parties. He does not 
purchase the drug, but uses it when friends offer it. To my knowledge, [he] has never dealt, sold, or trafficked in drugs. [He] uses the marijuana in 
my presence, but he doesn't use it to the extent that it bothers me. I currently see [his] friends on a social basis. To my knowledge, none of them 
are involved in the use of drugs. It is possible that other people, including friends, could think I have used drugs, although I never have.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . There is nothing in regards to my friends use of drugs or my use of alcohol that could be used to blackmail or pressure me into acting against 
the best interest if the U.S. Government and I would report any attempt to do so to the proper authorities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 6 June 2001, Applicant responded to interrogatories designed to elicit her boyfriend's subsequent drug use and her attitude toward drug use in 
her presence (Item 7):</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since June 29, 2000, my boyfriend has used marijuana extremely minimally. There are only 3 times I can think of, the first was July 4, 2000, at a 
picnic. The second was the last weekend in August 2000, at a small party. Thirdly, on New Years Eve, December 31, 2000, at a holiday party. 
None of the above situations occurred in my house or on its property. Since New Years Eve, 1/1/01, I have not know (sic) him to use marijuana 
or any drugs for that matter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no national security concern involved in my being in the presence of illegal activity. I do <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> touch or use marijuana. I do <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> pass any drug 
devices. I am <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> a "lookout." I <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">will not</SPAN> be coerced into trying any drug. I can <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not </SPAN>be blackmailed. View my judgement however you wish, but I 
am <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> and will <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">not</SPAN> be cause for national security concerns. (Emphasis in original).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Our [company] facility has no safeguarding capability. I have no assess (sic) to any level of classified information. (computer, paperwork, 
equipment) My boyfriend has no bearing on my job performance. My quality and the effort I put into my work has not and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">will not</SPAN> change or be 
changed by any outside force. I am not a security concern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a notarized statement on 7 September 2001 (Correspondence File), Applicant retreated--for the first time--from her stated intention to 
continue to be in the presence of individuals using drugs:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Please consider the following letter with Ms. Hogan's packet of information.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>I would 1ike to make this point that I was young and foolish being around people who know (sic) did drugs and especially my old boyfriend whom 
I no longer have contact with. We started dating before I was even twenty. Even young and foolish, I did not succumb to peer pressures to try any 
drug.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>Now, I am twenty-seven. My life has moved on. My current boyfriend, [named], as I stated in the "Dept. of Defense Directive 5220.6, question 
#2" that he, has been marijuana (drug) free since January 1, 2001, and has remained so. We plan to marry next August 2002.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>I can not honestly say that I will never see these friends/associates that partake in smoking marijuana. I will not deny them my friendship and 
counsel if they seek it. I can tell you that due to my fianc&eacute; being drug free we see less and less of these individuals.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>There is no reason for national concern over my being granted a security clearance for the reason of judgement. My position would be to a 
back-up FSO. In a nutshell the job is to mail paperwork back and forth between clearance applicants and the DSS. I have no access to any level 
of classified information. <EM>I make no judgmental decisions</EM>. My job is to send out forms, make sure they are filled out, and mail them to the DSS. I 
also send out visit letter faxes or help with filing.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>That is the whole extent of my government work. If I am granted this clearance it would not change my job's responsibilities, which only takes up 
approx. 15% of my work week. I hope you can see through all of this that I am a good person. Yes, I know right from wrong. It is not my position 
to judgement (sic) others. The only right I have is to judge myself and live my life so that I can be proud of it. I care more about how I see myself 
than how I appear when placed upon the clearance applicant scales. I have not lied when  it could have been an easier route to go and that I am 
proud of.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>Thank you for your time I certify the above is correct and true. (Emphasis in original).</P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  
Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or 
absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a 
case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.6. Association with persons involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden 
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the 
Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they 
must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence demonstrates that from approximately December 1994 to31  December 2000, Applicant has been present in a 
variety of social settings where assorted roommates, friends, or boyfriends have engaged in what appears to be recreational abuse of 
marijuana--and for a period of time ending in 1997--speed, acid, and hallucinogenic mushrooms. The evidence suggests that Applicant intends to 
continue to allow others to use at least marijuana in her presence.<A HREF="01-08420.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Although the Government has provided no evidence that the conduct of these 
individuals was criminal under the laws of the state where Applicant resided at the time,<A HREF="01-08420.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> these drugs are illegal and thus criminal within the 
meaning of Guideline E. That said, however, I do not find the Government has established a nexus between Applicant's conduct and the 
conclusion that she is unfit for access to classified information. In many cases, the Government is entitled to a presumption of nexus between the 
conduct proven and an adverse clearance conclusion. Nevertheless, here I find little reason to presume that nexus. Applicant's acquaintances do 
not appear to be involved in any ongoing criminal activity that would put Applicant at risk of arrest or otherwise subject her to duress or coercion. 
The concerns articulated by the Government in this case seem speculative. There is nothing in Applicant's acquiescence in her acquaintances' 
conduct to suggest that she is unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements for handling classified information. Thus, the risk she would 
deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information is minimal.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching this conclusion, I discount Applicant's assertions that she has no actual contact with classified information. I assume that if she has been 
certified as having a need for a clearance at any level that she will have access to classified information. And, as indicated above, my decision also 
assumes that Applicant will not remove herself from future situations where acquaintances or boyfriends engage in the recreational abuse of illegal 
drugs, should that happen. The record evidence indicates that Applicant has never used illegal drugs herself, has no intent to start, and has not been 
involved--other than her mere presence--in the recreational drug abuse of her acquaintances. I find Guideline E. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
