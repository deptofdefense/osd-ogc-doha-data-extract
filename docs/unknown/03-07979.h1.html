evaluated when determining security clearance eligibility. The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that are considered in 
denying or revoking an employee's request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and those factors that are considered in granting an 
employee's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual circumstances of each case are always 
different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P>

unfavorable, to arrive at meritorious decisions. Section E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a 
case as the "whole person concept." In evaluating the conduct of the applicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should 
consider pursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, 
decisions under the Directive must include consideration of not just the <EM>actual </EM>risk of disclosure of such information, but also consideration of any <EM>possible</EM> risk 
an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information in any aspect of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should 
be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. The decision to deny a security clearance request to 
an individual is not necessarily a determination of the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-07979.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline D. Applicant admitted he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with his autistic daughter on 
numerous occasions in 2000. Considering all the evidence, I conclude this constituted sexual behavior of a criminal nature. Applicant  sexually abused his 
daughter by rubbing her inner thigh and vaginal area on multiple occasions. While he admitted the acts, he denied that it constituted abusive behavior because 
he did it to either relax or stimulate his daughter. Applicant's argument is unpersuasive. He became sexually aroused on multiple occasions while fondling his 
daughter, and he admitted wanting to feel a sense of sexual joy from his daughter. Further, there is no indication that this fondling was part of a prescribed or 
medically accepted course of care for his daughter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attempted to explain away his earlier admissions to investigators by claiming he used "extreme" terms to describe his behavior out of guilt for his 
daughter's condition. His explanation is implausible and unreasonable. I am not persuaded that any guilt Applicant may have felt because of his daughter's 
affliction would motivate him to falsely admit to sexual or physical conduct he did not commit.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant argued that the fact that the local police did not file charges exonerates him. The prosecutor's  recommendation that the case be handled through the 
local department of social services is not tantamount to a finding that no criminal conduct occurred. Thus, Applicant's conduct pertaining to sexual behavior 
falls within Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) E2.A4.2.1. (<EM>sexual behavior of a criminal nature whether or not the individual has been 
prosecuted</EM>), and SB DC E2.A.4.1.2.4. <EM>(Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment).</EM></SPAN></P>

Although he contends that his family, friends, some neighbors, and his current employer know 
of this past sexual behavior, no information was provided as to who is actually aware of what. In the absence of specifics, there may be people could use this 
information against Applicant for coercion, exploitation, or duress. At the time he submitted his security clearance application in 2001, Applicant notified his 
employer about the local department investigation for sexual child abuse. However, future employers or a broader group of people, such as neighbors or future 
coworkers might subject Applicant to blackmail. Thus, SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3. (<EM>sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress),</EM> also<EM> </EM>applies in this case<EM>.</EM></SPAN></P>

Therefore, Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) E2.A4.1.3.2. 
<EM>(the behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature ) </EM>applies. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the remaining SB MC and conclude they do not apply. SB MC E2.A4.1.3.3. (<EM>there is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, 
or emotional instability) </EM>does<EM> </EM>not apply<EM>. </EM>Applicant's May 31<EM>, </EM>2005, statement says he has learned not to volunteer any information in the future. Applicant's

suitability. Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant's admissions to the NSA investigator in November 2001 and the DSS agent in August 
2002, concerning child sexual abuse, raises serious questionable judgment or unreliability. Applicant physically abused his daughter, and admitted becoming 
angry and frustrated with her and that 50% of her bruises resulted from his malicious conduct. Applicant's position changed markedly when he admitted feeling 
angry but denied ever acting on those impulses. More recently, Applicant did not deny using physical force to restrain and control his daughter, but argued it 
was not abuse because it was for a proper purpose. I find Applicant's inculpatory first statement is credible and his later exculpatory statements are not 
believable. I conclude there is reliable evidence showing Applicant physically abused his daughter, therefore Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC 
DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>reliable,</EM> <EM>unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was worried about possible prosecution. Although certain people know about the incidents, that does not mean that he would want a broader group of 
people to have that information about his physical and sexual abuse of his daughter. Applicant's neighbors, future employers and/or coworkers do not know 
about the child abuse incidents. Applicant's 2005 admission of his "extreme" misinterpretation of his handling of his daughter, and exoneration by the local 
police (no criminal charges filed) is not enough to mitigate the security concerns engendered by his sexual misconduct with his own five-year-old child. This is 
exactly the type of information that makes one susceptible to exploitation in various situations. Thus, Applicant's personal conduct also falls within PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.4. (<EM>personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation</EM>,<EM> or duress, such as 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail).</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not volunteer this information concerning his physical or sexual behavior with his disabled daughter until confronted during a security interview 
in 2001. His admissions changed over time and he minimized the incidents, especially in his 2005 response to the FORM. His statement that he would not 
volunteer information in the future does not alleviate a concern for lack of candor, untrustworthiness or unreliability, and thus, I find that his personal conduct 
could increase his vulnerability to coercion or render him susceptible to blackmail. Thus Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A.5.1.3.5 (<EM>the 
individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress)</EM> does not apply. None of the other PC 
C's apply in this case except the one discussed above. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. 
Accordingly, allegation 2.a. of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
