<P>On July 26, 1999, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended by Change 4, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The
SOR  detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR  recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to
conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. </P>

<P>     </P>

<P>On September 13, 1999, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to me for resolution on October 18, 1999.  On October 27, 1999, a Notice of
Hearing was issued, setting the matter for November 10, 1999, on which date the hearing was conducted.     </P>

<P>At the hearing, the Government called one witness<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>, and offered 8 exhibits.   These exhibits were marked for identification as Government's
Exhibits (GX) 1 - 8.  Applicant testified in his own behalf and offered 5 exhibits,<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> marked for identification as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A -
E.  Without objection all of Applicant's and the Government's exhibits were admitted into evidence as marked.  The transcript was received at
DOHA on November 29, 1999. </P>

<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based on the 9 drug-related allegations under Guideline H (SOR
1.a. - 1.c.) of the attached SOR; six personal conduct-related allegations under Guideline E (SOR 2.a.(1) and (2), 2.b.(1) and (2), and  2.c.(1)
and (2); and two criminal conduct-related allegations under Guideline J (SOR 3.a. and 3.b.).<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In evaluating the evidence, in addition to the general guidelines found in Section E.2.2 of Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and the additional
specific guidelines found therein,  I considered the following points: (1) whether the evidence supports each and every SOR allegation; (2)
whether the evidence comes within one or more of the Directive's three adjudicative guidelines cited in the SOR; (3) whether the evidence
establishes a nexus or connection with Applicant's security clearance eligibility; and (4) whether Applicant has established mitigation and/or
extenuation as to any or all of the allegations. </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P>After a thorough review and analysis of Applicant's response to the SOR, in which he "admits" all 9 allegations under Guideline H, and
"denies" the remaining allegations; under Guidelines E and J, all the hearing testimony and exhibits from both parties; and closing arguments
by both parties as to how the record evidence should be viewed, I make the following findings of fact<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>
<P>:</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic">Guideline H (Drugs) </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.a. and 1.b. - Applicant used (1991 - Summer 1998) and purchased (1992 - Summer 1998) marijuana, with varying frequency, with use
sometimes daily (Transcript (Tr) at 30).<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.c. - Applicant received treatment from September 2, 1993 to January 24, 1994 for a condition diagnosed as cannabis dependence and
psychoactive substance abuse.  He failed to complete the treatment.  Applicant's mother referred him for this treatment (Tr at 33).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.d. -  Applicant was arrested on October 14, 1993 for possession of marijuana.  This was during his period of treatment as cited in SOR
1.c.  Applicant pleaded guilty.  He was sentenced to six months in jail suspended upon payment of a fine and completion of a drug treatment
program. Applicant failed to pay the fine of $350.00 and was arrested on a warrant issued by the court.  The court-ordered treatment program
overlapped the treatment cited in SOR 1.c., above (Tr at 38).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.e. and 1.f. - Applicant used and purchased methamphetamine from April 1995 to April 1997.  He sometimes used methamphetamine
five times a week (Tr at 30, 31).  The methamphetamine was used to keep Applicant awake during long work hours (Tr at 40) and he "did use
it at the place of employment" (Tr at 41).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.g. - Applicant used cocaine in 1992 on approximately five occasions (Tr at 30).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.h. - Applicant used psilocybin (hallucinogenic mushrooms) in 1992 (Tr at 30).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 1.i. - Applicant has used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Response to SOR).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife used drugs with him and they moved to state  A to get away from their old lifestyle (Tr at 41).  Applicant has stated an intent
not to use illegal drugs in the future (Tr at 30). This is a change from his October 1998 statement that he "may occasionally" use marijuana in
the future (GX 2).  His current explanation is that "working for the government has helped me to realize I can't use drugs" (Tr at 43). </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic">Guideline E (Personal Conduct) </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 2.a.(1) and (2) - Applicant falsified material facts on his May 14, 1998 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) as to
Question 24 - Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses by (1) by failing to mention his October 1993 arrest for Possession of Marijuana,
as cited in SOR 1.d. and (2) by failing to mention his being cited in 1993 for Possession of Alcohol and ordered to participate in a substance
abuse program. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 2.b.(1) and (2) - Applicant falsified material facts on his May 14, 1998 SF 86 as to Question 26 - Your Police Record - Other Offenses
by failing to mention (1) his November 1993 arrest for Theft and (2) his being charged in October 1997 for Issuing Bad Checks.  His bail in
this latter case was set at $692.52 and he was ordered to make restitution of $793.00.  As of October 28, 1998, he still owed $443.00.  At the
hearing, Applicant testified and produced documentation that he had paid off this court-ordered debt as of August 11, 1999 (Tr at 57, 58 and
AX D)   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 2.c.(1) and (2) - Applicant falsified material facts on his May 14, 1998 SF 86 as to Question 27 - Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug
Activity by failing to mention (1) his drug use as cited in SOR 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h., above, i.e. methamphetamine, cocaine, and
psilocybin/psilocin and (2) his use of marijuana, with varying frequency, at time daily, from 1991 to July 1998. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 3.a. - Applicant's intentional falsification of any or all of the allegations cited in paragraph 2, above, constitutes a violation(s) of 18 USC
1001.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR 3.b. - Applicant's October 1993 arrest for Possession of Marijuana, as cited in SOR 1.d., above, and his being charged with Issuing Bad
Checks, as cited in SOR 2.b.(2), above, constituted violations of state law, as shown by GX 3 and GX 8.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character is attested to by three friends/work colleagues (AX A, B, and C).</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process established by DoD Directive 5220.6 is based on the "whole person" concept.  All available, reliable information
about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. 
Enclosure 2 to the Directive, as amended by Change 4, sets forth specific adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully considered according
to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence
of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  In the present case, none of these nine factors, individually or
together, warrant a determination favorable to Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors cited above exhaust the realm
of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion
may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or
recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally unstable behavior. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to
this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic"><STRONG>Guideline H (Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The expressed concern is that "Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to
protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.2 Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (DC) include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase. sale, or distribution. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4. Evaluation of drug abuse or dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment
program.<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A81.3. Conditions that could mitigate (MC) security concerns:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None - e.g., Applicant's drug involvement is still recent, in context  (MC 1) and was not an isolated or aberrational event (MC 2); Applicant
has not yet <EM>demonstrated </EM>an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (MC 3); and there is no evidence Applicant has successfully completed
a prescribed drug treatment program (MC 4).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to .
. . determine security clearance eligibility. . . .; </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violation, e.g., falsifications on SF 86, in sworn statements, and of company rules re alcohol use.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic"><STRONG>Condition J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None - In particular, Applicant's criminal behavior remains recent and was not an isolated incident (MC (1) and (2)); nor is there any evidence
of successful rehabilitation (MC 6).   Other possible mitigating conditions are not applicable under facts of this case. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are
reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security
clearance.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not
permitted to speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. 
In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified
information and material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information
indicates that an Applicant for a security clearance may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or
unreliability on the part of an Applicant.  These concerns include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific
allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the Applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by an Applicant's admissions or by other
evidence) and establishes conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within
specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for
the applicant. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence. 
When the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the
Navy V. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly  consistent standard indicates security clearance determinations should err, if they must,
on the side of denials."  As I understand the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved in favor of the Government. </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic"><EM>D</EM>rugs</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 24 years old.  He began using drugs in 1991,when he was about 16, and continued until at least the Summer of 1998.  In his
response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR's allegations of drug use and involvement.  The other record likewise establishes
Applicant's longstanding drug activity.   According to Applicant, he stopped using drugs in September 1997, around the time he was moving
from state A to state B, and concentrating on improving his chances of gaining employment (Response to SOR).  Nevertheless, he used
marijuana again after moving to state B, in the Spring (May) of 1998 "on isolated incidents" but states an intent not to use it again (Response
to SOR).  At the hearing he fixed the date of last use at July 1998 (Tr at 42)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic">Falsifications/Personal Conduct</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Second only perhaps to actual violation of rules and regulations for protecting classified material, lying about material facts on security
clearance applications and to Defense Security Service (DSS) investigators goes directly to the heart of the security clearance process.  The
fact of the omission of material information relating to the three questions in Applicant's SCA, as cited in paragraph 2 of the SOR <EM>and </EM>the
relevancy of that evidence to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is clearly established.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The remaining issue is whether Applicant has provided explanation, mitigation and/or extenuation adequate to overcome the negative impact
of the Government's case.  Applicant has provided a variety of explanations.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant states as to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 24 on the SCA: (1) "I did not answer Question 24 on the security application" and (2) "I did not recall this incident happening." 
This response is unclear, in that both statements could be meant to apply to both Applicant's October 1993 arrest for Possession of Marijuana
<EM>and </EM>to his 1993 citation for Possession of Alcohol <EM>or </EM>the statements could have been meant to be applied separately to the two arrests, i.e.,
response (1) to SOR 2.a.(1) and response (2) to SOR 2.a.(2).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 26 on the SCA: (1) "I did not recall the incident taking place until after I received the denial of my security clearance and I requested
a copy of the arrest report. . . ;" and (2) "Since this was a part of the bankruptcy in June 1997, I answered this with question 27.a  SOR 2.b.(1)
refers to Applicant's November 1993 arrest for Theft and SOR 2.b.(2) refers to Applicant's being charged in October 1997 with Issuing Bad
Checks.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27 on the SCA: (1) and (2): "I voluntarily gave this information in an interview with a security officer."  SOR 2.c.(1) refers to
Applicant's use of methamphetamine, cocaine, and psilocybin/psilocin, as alleged in SOR 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to all three SOR allegations, 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c., Applicant begins by stating:"I deny.  I did not answer question [24, 26, and 27] on the
security application."  Since these three questions are answered "No" in GX 4, this answer was puzzling.  In his hearing testimony, Applicant
provided a partial copy of another SF 86 (AX E) (a paper version) he states he filed out before completion of the final version of the SF 86
included in the Government's exhibits (GX 4) (the EPSQ version).  His exhibit lacks several pages and is undated, but an attached page
appears to be a response from Applicant's employer's security officer, asking for information not on the SF 86 submitted by Applicant.  In
context, his explanation for the missing pages (Tr at 52, 53) does not ring true.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's testimony does not match his written response to the SOR.  He testified he did not answer the three questions about his drug use
and arrests because he "was unsure of the exact dates of my arrests and charges against me, and I chose to leave  these questions blank, not
knowing the correct information to put there, figuring I would be questioned about these later on" (Tr at 29).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, Applicant's hearing testimony is internally implausible.  As to how the "No" answers came to be on the SF 86 signed by
Applicant and submitted to DoD, Applicant provides several explanations, i.e., (1) that the company's security officer must have assumed
Applicant meant to answer "No," and checked those boxes on Applicant's behalf (Tr at 29); and (2) that Applicant simply failed to notice
these three "No" answers when he received the final version of the SF 86 back from the security officer and added his own (Applicant's)
signature at the end of the form.  These unproven assumptions and negligent, if that, signing of a SF 86 but disclaiming responsibility for its
contents are too much of a coincidence and are too implausible to be considered real substantive evidence.  On cross examination, Applicant
expanded on how the incorrect answers came to be on the DF 86 submitted to DoD (Tr at 44 - 50) but did not adequately explain away his
conduct in submitting a signed and sworn SF 86 containing false information about several vital issues.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations cause a number of additional questions about his reliability and trustworthiness to arise:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) AX E is incomplete, in that the pages containing the important three questions are not part of the exhibit.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) AX E includes a page from the security officer asking for additional information needed to complete a number of specific questions,
apparently not adequately completed by Applicant.  The page does not mention or ask for information about Applicant's drug use and police
record, matters at least as important, if not more so, than completed names and addresses of other individuals.  The omission of requests for
such answers at least suggests that the form submitted by Applicant to the security officer <EM>did </EM>contain "No" answers to Questions 24, 26, and
27.  There is no contrary evidence.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Applicant was given an opportunity to contact the security officer and obtain a completed copy of the first draft of the SF 86, which, if
Applicant was being truthful at the hearing, would likely contain "No" answers to the three questions with which we are concerned.  In
addition, Applicant was asked by me to request that the security officer submit a statement, through Department Counsel, that the first draft
SF 86 as submitted to her by Applicant did or did not contain answers to the three drug and arrest-related questions <EM>and</EM>, if not, how the "No"
answers came to be on the final version of the SF 86, as submitted to DoD.  Applicant was given seven days, until COB on Friday, 
November 19, 1999 to transmit such documents to Department Counsel, or in the alternative, if he was unable to contact the security officer
or to obtain the documents, to submit a letter from him explaining his efforts (Tr at 53 - 55).  No documents or other response were received
at DOHA within the time allowed and none have been received as of the date of this decision.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On this record, it is impossible to accept Applicant's explanations as <EM>demonstrating</EM> that his claims of innocence and/or simple neglect as to
the falsifications are true and can be accepted as true. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold Italic">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated above as to Personal Conduct, I conclude the omissions in questions were deliberate and therefore violate Title 18
U.S.C. 1001 and that the misconduct described in SOR 1.d. and 2.b.(2) constitute violations of state law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The three letters from colleagues (AX A, B, and C) are helpful in viewing Applicant's work  ethic as a positive one.  However, none of them
relates to Applicant's failings in his history of drug use and security clearance-related falsifications, and none of them overcomes the weight
of the Government's negative evidence.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I was impressed by the testimony of Applicant's mother-in-law (Tr at 60 - 63).  She views Applicant as having lacked "wisdom"in the past
and that he move to state A "to get away from drugs" in his former state of residence.  She was at least partially aware of Applicant's drug
involvement in the past and she believes he has shown himself to be rehabilitated.  She also believes Applicant to be truthful.  This witness's
testimony is helpful in understanding Applicant's drug history.  However, it is the combination of drug use <EM>and </EM>falsifications that establishes
that he is not currently eligible for access to the nation's secrets.  However sincere Applicant may be as to his intentions, he has not yet
established his ability to conform his conduct to the standards of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking
access to the nations's secrets. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the overall facts and circumstances of this case, I conclude that Applicant has not established mitigation or extenuation for any of the
SOR allegations.<A HREF="99-0438.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant is encouraged to takes advantage of the one-year waiting period before he can reapply for a security clearance,
to demonstrate that his mother-in-law's confidence is well placed and that his present good conduct can be relied upon to continue.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> This was Applicant's mother-in-law, who testified at the request of Department Counsel after Applicant finished his testimony.  During his
testimony, the mother-in-law, who was in the courtroom to lend support, made a comment in support of her husband audible to all of us. 
Department Counsel called her to testify and asked her to expand on her comment (Transcript (Tr) at 60).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>  Three exhibits, A, B, and C, were previously submitted as part of applicant's response to the SOR.  At the hearing (Tr at 10 -12), these
three exhibits were detached from the response and added to Applicant's two hearing exhibits, C and D. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>  The SOR in this matter was issued after July 1, 1999, so that Change 4 to the Directive, which became effective as of that date, applies to
this matter.  Change 4 uses the term "Guideline," instead of the previously used term "Criterion."  Although the SOR uses the term "Criteria,
"rather than "Guideline," the difference in terminology has no effect on the substantive issues to be resolved.  </P>

<P> 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>  As is made clear in the transcript, the SOR includes some allegations that contain cross-citations to other allegations. In each case, the
correct citations were identified and the SOR in the case file was amended by me, without objection, to conform to the evidence.  The SOR
contains these corrections in blue ink.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A> In GX 2, at page 3, Applicant gives the date of last use as October 1998.  In his answer to the SOR, he states "Spring of 1998."  Overall, I
conclude the date was most likely the Summer of 1998, specifically the Fourth of July weekend (Tr at 32).
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A> GX 7 contains an evaluation of cannabis dependence and psychoactive substances by a person identified as a LCSW, which I take to
designate a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, who is an employee of a state operated treatment program.  Although the treatment program was
clearly not successful, DC 5 is not applicable since GX 7 does not indicate that the treatment program was prescribed by a credentialed
medical professional 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>  MC 3 is deemed not applicable because Applicant's subsequent admissions do not qualify as "prompt, good faith efforts to correct the
falsification(s) before being confronted with the facts.  MC 4 is deemed not applicable because the individuals on whose advice he acted are
not identified as "authorized personnel."  Likewise, none of the other MCs are demonstrated by substantial record evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>  It has not been definitively established whether the treatments cited in SOR 1.c. and 1.d. are the same, different, or overlapping.  As close
as I can tell, they were different but  overlapping (Tr at 37 - 39).  Any uncertainty on this  point does not affect the overall validity of each
allegation.
