<P>This 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor has a history of 22 delinquent debts beginning in about 1998  and still unresolved.  She did not truthfully describe her financial situation when she

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care System Program Office (CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, 
Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD C<SUP>3</SUP>I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed in 
Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, </SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personnel Security Program </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Regulation), dated January 1987.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 14, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for Applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position (ADP).  The Applicant responded to the 
SOR in writing on June 27, 2006 and requested a decision made on the written record, i.e., without an administrative hearing.  A File of Relevant Materials (FORM) was issued on August 7, 2006.  
Applicant was informed that any response had to be submitted within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Any such response was due by September 17, 2006, but none has been received at DOHA.  
This case was assigned to me for decision on September 22, 2006, to determine whether a determination of trustworthiness should be made or continued, denied or revoked. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains twenty-two (22) allegations under Guideline F (Financial) and one (1) allegation under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  Applicant admits all 22 allegations (1.a. -1.v) under Guideline F.  She denies the single allegation (2.a.) under Guideline E.  All admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as 
Findings of Fact.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request to for a determination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive information on the basis of allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN>  After 
considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR paragraph and allegation.</P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</EM></P> 
 
<P>As of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant had delinquent debts owing to the following creditors in the approximate amounts shown:</P> 
 
<P>1.a.  Creditor A ---------------------------------------------------------------------$368.00</P> 
 
<P>1.b.  Creditor B -------------------------------------------------------------------$3,678.00</P> 
 
<P>1.c.  Creditor C  ------------------------------------------------------------------$6,393.00</P> 
 
<P>            1.d.  Creditor D ---------------------------------------------------------------------$192.00  </P> 
 
<P>1.e.  Bank E -------------------------------------------------------------------------$207.00</P> 
 
<P>1.f.  Credit Card F ---------------------------------------------------------------$1,620.00 </P>

<P>1.h. Creditor H ---------------------------------------------------------------------$568.00</P> 
 
<P>1.i.  Bank I ------------------------------------------------------------------------$2,769.00</P> 
 
<P>1.j.  Creditor J -----------------------------------------------------------------------$369.00</P> 
 
<P>1.k.  Creditor K --------------------------------------------------------------------$1,078.00</P> 
 
<P>1.l.  Creditor L ---------------------------------------------------------------------$6,850.00 </P> 
 
<P>1.m. Bank M -----------------------------------------------------------------------$3,833.00</P> 
 
<P>            1.n.  Creditor N ----------------------------------------------------------------------$811.00  </P>

<P>1.q. Creditor Q -----------------------------------------------------------------------$889.00</P> 
 
<P>1.r.  Creditor R -----------------------------------------------------------------------$733.34</P> 
 
<P>1.s.  Creditor S -----------------------------------------------------------------------$113.00</P>

<P>1.u. Creditor U ---------------------------------------------------------------------$3,991.00</P> 
 
<P>1.v. Creditor V -----------------------------------------------------------------------$386.00 </P> 
 
<P>The amount of undisputed delinquent debt, as cited in the SOR, currently exceeds $51, 854.00, plus additional unknown penalties and interest.</P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</EM></P> 
 
<P>2.a. Appellant falsified material facts on her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), executed on August 16, 2004), as to Question <STRONG>22 Your Financial record </STRONG>- b. Are you now over 180 
days delinquent on any loan financial obligation?  She knowingly did not disclose most of her delinquent debts.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive requires that an applicant be considered under the "whole person concept."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors: E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  E2.2.1.2. The 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;  E2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;  E2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct;  E2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;  E2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of<EM> </EM>rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;  E2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct; 
E2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;  and E2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN> Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of 
nine generic factors relevant the conduct, to include knowing participation.  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether 
it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance [and to work in Information Systems Positions].  An applicant's admission of the information in 
specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government 
has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  </P> 
 
<P>If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it 
is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government, based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at 
E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is an employee of a defense contractor.  In her response to the SOR, she admits all 22 financial allegations, without accompanying explanations or excuses (Item 2).  The FORM she 
received contained all of the Government's supporting documentation and a statement of the Government's evaluation of the evidence.  Applicant chose not to provide any documents refuting the 
Government's evidence.  </P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</EM>-</P> 
 
<P>In the absence of any evidence showing the recent paying off or other resolution of the 22 delinquent debts, the evidence compels the conclusion that all 22 delinquent debts remain open and owing 
in at least the amounts shown in the SOR.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant explains that her getting into debt began when she purchased a home in 1998  and began receiving unsolicited credit cards.  She began using the cards, and within six months was unable 
to pay the credit card bills along with her monthly operating expenses.  She recognized she </P> 
 
<P>has acted irresponsibly, but was unable to fix the problem.  The debts increased rapidly as described in her sworn statements of December 2003, December 2004 and February 2005 (Items 6, 7, and 
8).</P> 
 
<P>As of December 2004, she had delinquent debts of more than $51,800.00 and a monthly earnings remainder of  $244 (Item 6 at 6).  There is no evidence of any financial improvements since that 
time.   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially 
profitable criminal acts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Disqualifying Conditions</EM>: E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations; and  E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. <EM>Mitigating Conditions: </EM>None that are established 
by the record; e.g., E2.A6.1.3.1. The behavior is recent; E2.A6.1.3.2. It was not an isolated incident; E2.A6.1.3.3. There is no evidence that the conditions that resulted in Applicant's failure to 
timely resolve the debts were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation); and  
E2.A6.1.3.6. the individual has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  As of the closing of the record, her efforts toward financial rehabilitation 
appear to be nonexistent. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under both of the above Guidelines and the Directive's "whole person concept," Applicant has not come close to overcoming the evidence supporting the Government's concerns, as stated in the 
SOR.  She has simply not demonstrated that she possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">someone seeking to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>In the year that must pass after this decision becomes final before Applicant can reapply, she will have the opportunity to resolve her delinquent debts, and to demonstrate financial rehabilitation. </P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</EM></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered Applicant's explanations for not answering Question 22b correctly on her SF 85P.  Applicant asserts in her response to the SOR that she believed she did not have to 
report debts if they were the same as the previous year (Item 5).  Her explanation is unsupported by any other evidence and lacks credibility.  In addition, in her sworn statement of 2003, and in her 
SF 85P, she also did not report most of her delinquent debts (Items 2 and 5).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard sensitive information while operating in an Information Systems Position.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Disqualifying Conditions</EM>: E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Mitigating Conditions</EM>: None that is established by the record.</SPAN></P>
