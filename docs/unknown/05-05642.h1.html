<P>Applicant is 55 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since March 2003. She has over $61,000 in delinquent debts that she has made no effort to 
pay. Due to a medical condition she had a period of memory loss. However, when filling out her SF 85 she was aware that she had more than just her student 
loan debts that were delinquent. Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guidelines F and E. It is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On May 19, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a trustworthiness determination. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to 
grant the application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, (</EM>Jan. 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On October 21, 2005, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
trustworthiness concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 22, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In her SOR response, Applicant admitted 
SOR allegations &para;&para; 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.g, 1.j-1.q, 1.u, 1.w, 1.x, and 1.z. She denied the allegations in SOR &para; 1.d, believing it was a duplicate debt, and denied SOR &para;&para; 
1.s, 1.t, and 2.a. She answered the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.h, 1.i, 1.v, 1.y, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.cc and 1.dd as either "unknown" or "unsure." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to 
me on March 15, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on March 27, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 11, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. 
The government submitted six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. 
Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted four exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-D. The exhibits were admitted without 
objection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 21, 2006</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 55 years old, divorced in 1985 and remarried in 1996. Her two children are grown. She has worked for a federal contractor since March 2003 as a 
client support representative. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attended college from 1984 through 1989 and accumulated student loan debt.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She has approximately $46,000 in student loan debt that has been 
delinquent and in a collection status since at least 1992.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She has made one voluntary payment on that debt and believes, but does not know for sure, that the 
Internal Revenue Service may have garnished her tax refund at some time to apply to the debt.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In her sworn statement made to an investigator on October 4, 
2004, she stated: "I admit I owe on the student loan, but I do not know how much the balance is. I intend to research the company who has the student loan and 
make arrangements to pay the bill. I expect it will take about 10 years to pay in full."<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She claims she never had enough money to pay the debt. Applicant 
provided no evidence that she has researched her student loans or made any payment arrangements in the past or since her statement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had medical problems for approximately three and a half years and was hospitalized in 2000.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> She did not have medical insurance. Her health 
improved and she returned to work in March 2003.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant admits she has unpaid medical bills listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.e, 1.j, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.aa, and 1.bb, totaling 
approximately $11,868.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> She believes her husband paid one medical bill, but did not provide any documentation, nor does she know which debt may have been 
paid. In her October 4, 2004 statement, she acknowledged debts for medical bills. She stated she did make some payments on the bills as she was able. She 
claimed she told her doctor's office that she was moving to a new state and provided a forwarding address. She claimed after she moved she made some 
additional payments toward her medical bills and then stopped. She provided no reason why she ceased paying her delinquent medical bills. She did not know 
how much she still owed. She claimed she never received any collection notices.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> She also never contacted her creditors to settle her debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2003, Applicant and her husband went to a financial counseling firm and learned she had two judgments filed against her for medical services from 
the state where she had previous lived. She claimed she paid one judgment, but does not know which one, nor how much it was for, and she stated she did not 
have any documentation to support her claim.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> She claimed in her October 4, 2004, statement that she intended to have the other judgment paid off in full in 
one year.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant provided no proof she has paid the judgment. Applicant was aware in March 2003, that she had at least one remaining judgment against 
her. Applicant and her husband were not satisfied with the counseling firm because they felt the counselors were mostly interested in trying to sell Applicant 
and her husband a house, so they stopped going.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged in her written statement that she recalled seeing the delinquent account listed in SOR &para; 1.v on the financial counseling report she 
received in March 2003. She believed it was her account and her intentions at the time were to have it paid in full in 60 days.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Applicant has not paid the 
account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged she used to purchase food from the account listed in SOR &para;1.w. She stated in October 2004 that she intended to research the debt, 
verify it, and pay it within one week.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Applicant has not paid the debt. She also stated she intended to pay within 30 days the account listed in SOR &para; 1.s.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> She 
has not paid this account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owes approximately $360 on nine debts to one creditor for writing bad checks.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The amounts of these debts range from $20 to $62. The debts were 
placed in collection from 1999 to 2000. Applicant has not paid these debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant suffered from depression beginning in about 1996. She did not provide any proof of her diagnosis. She claimed she suffered memory loss for several 
years and she still can not recall things from her past. On her public trust questionnaire (SF 85) when asked if she had debts over 180 days delinquent, she listed 
only her student loans and no other debts. She claimed in her October 4, 2004 statement that when she read the question she stopped at the word loan and did 
not read on to the end of the sentence inquiring about financial obligations in addition to loans. She claimed at her hearing that because of her memory loss, she 
could not recall her other delinquent debts when filling out her SF 85 on May 19, 2004. Applicant acknowledge her health was better in January 2003 and 
acknowledge a clean bill of health in October 2004, and that she was off medication and no longer receiving treatment. Applicant was aware when she filled out 
her SF 85 that she had other delinquent debts. <A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> She failed to list them because she claims she could not remember the specifics.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owes approximately $5,900 to the Social Security Administration that is being garnished from her wages for overpayment of disability benefits she 
was not entitled to receive.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> She also has approximately $4,820 listed on her credit report that is in a collection status for medical expenses she owes.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's husband bought a house in June 2004 using only his credit. Applicant claimed that because she was not employed long enough they did not look 
into her credit. Applicant stated at the end of the month she and her husband have approximately $800-$1000 in expendable income.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> She stated her husband 
intends to refinance his house to help pay off some of her delinquent debts. They hope to receive approximately $15,000 to $20,000 from the refinancing.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts total over $61,770. In addition, she owes $5,900 to the Social Security Administration and has a debt for $4,820 in collection for 
medical services, thereby increasing her total debt to $72,490. Applicant has paid one debt to a creditor not listed in the SOR.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> Applicant claims her husband 
paid one debt listed on the SOR, but does not know which one and did not provide any supporting documentation.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received accolades from her employer and those she works with regarding her performance. She is considered a leader and is viewed as having the 
utmost respect and concern for their clients.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Her integrity has never been questioned by her supervisor and she has his highest recommendation.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Applicant 
provided numerous letters of appreciation that were sent to her employer regarding her performance, and thank you letters from clients.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Applicant was selected 
as the employee of the quarter.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position&hellip; that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The President provided that eligibility for access to classified

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. "The standard that must be met for 
. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the 
person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> The Regulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Financial Considerations-a trustworthiness concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at 
risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from 
financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is a trustworthiness concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines F and E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations),</EM> and FC DC 3<EM> (Inability 
or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>),<EM> </EM>apply in this case. Applicant has a long history of not paying her financial obligations dating as far back to at least 1992. 
Despite being aware of delinquent student loans, she has made only one voluntary payment. Also despite being aware of some of her other debts and making 
promises to pay them, she has made no effort to pay them.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and especially considered FC MC 1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent), </EM>FC MC 2 (<EM>The 
behavior was isolated), </EM>FC MC 3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),</EM> FC MC 4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)</EM>, and FC MC 6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has many debts that remain unpaid. FC MC 1 and 2 do not apply. Applicant had a medical problem, did not have medical insurance and although she 
initially made some payments toward her medical expenses before and after she moved, she basically stopped and the debts remain outstanding. Even though 
the debts relating to her medical issues arose due to circumstances beyond her control, it is appropriate to consider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> Applicant paid what she could for a time and then just stopped. Despite having some income left over at 
the end of the month she has not contacted the creditors to make any arrangement to satisfy her medical or any other of her debts. Applicant has been delinquent 
in paying her student loans for at least 14 years and has not made a good faith effort to set up even a minimal payment plan. She has basically ignored these 
debts. Despite her claims that she would pay certain debts in a prescribed period of time since making her sworn statement in October 2004, she has not made 
any effort to pay even the most nominal of her debts. Despite FC MC 3 being applicable I find it is not enough to overcome Applicant's financial history and 
current situation. I find although Applicant did seek some financial counseling she admits it was not of the type to help her resolve her debts and she did not 
pursue financial counseling any further. She made claims she would pay some of her debts but has failed to follow through. She has not shown any resolve or 
will to take action on her debts. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns raised under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> <EM>),</EM> applies in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from a trustworthy determination application is a concern and may be disqualifying. PC DC 2. 
Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an applicant's 
background.<A HREF="05-05642.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An applicant's financial situation is a matter that could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant a clearance, and her failure 
to disclose it would impede a thorough investigation of her background. Applicant listed only that she had delinquent student loans and failed to list she had 
other debts on her SF 85.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately concealed the full extent of her delinquencies on her SF 85. I find Applicant credible in that she did suffer a memory loss because of her 
illness and she could not recall all of her delinquent debts when she filled out her SF 85. However, I find disturbing that Applicant's written statement claimed 
she had merely stopped reading the question when it asked her if she had any outstanding loans and she did not finish the inquiry to understand that it also 
requested she list her financial delinquencies. Later she testified that the reason she failed to list her delinquencies was because she could not recall her debts 
due to a memory loss. However, she was aware that she had other delinquent debts. Although I do believe she could not remember all of her debts, I do not 
believe she was unaware that she had more debts that just her student loans, and failed to list them because she could not remember the specifics. She admitted 
in her October 4, 2004 statement that when she and her husband went to the financial counselor in March 2003, she became aware that there were two 
outstanding judgments against her. One she claimed she paid, the other she did not pay. She did not list this debt on the SF 85. She also acknowledged in her 
statement that she recalled seeing the debt listed in SOR &para; 1.v on the financial counselors report she viewed in March 2003, but again failed to list it in her SF 
85. Her visit to the financial counselor was after she had started working and was healthy. She certainly was on notice that these debts existed even if she could 
not remember she had others. Applicant offered no corroborating evidence as to her medical condition. I find that although she likely had memory loss and 
could not remember many of the specific debts, she was made aware of some of them after she became healthy and was aware she owed more than just her 
student loans. She was very aware that her memory was impaired and was on notice to make that known. However, she did not check with her husband or make 
any attempt to make a note on her SF 85 that she may have other debts. She failed to provide the correct information until confronted by an investigator months 
later. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) 2 (<EM>The falsification was an isolated 
incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>PC MC 3 (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith 
efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), </EM>and<EM> </EM>PC MC 5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. No evidence was presented to show she has 
taken positive steps to reduce her vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress. PC MC 2, PC MC 3, and PC MC 5, do not apply. I find none of the other 
mitigating conditions under Guideline E apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns with regard to his personal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. Although Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not in 
question, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that she failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guidelines F and E, and that it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</SPAN></P>
