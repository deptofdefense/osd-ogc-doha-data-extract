<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 4, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 
2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement, dated August 8, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 10, 
2005, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant filed a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">January</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 23, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered 12 documentary exhibits, identified as Items1-12, and Applicant offered a two page letter from himself (Item A), a two page letter from his employer (Item B), and 
additional information concerning Afghanistan (Item C). All of the documents have been admitted into the record without objection.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive. The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through 1.c., under Guideline B. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his 
response to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegation 1.a., and denied 1.b. and 1.c. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The admitted allegation is incorporated herein as a Finding of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Unfortunately, in this case the evidence offered into the record regarding Applicant's background and the allegations alleged in the SOR is extremely limited.  After a complete and thorough review 
of the evidence that has been entered in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 46 years old. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.

three children (Item 3).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

The </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> has alleged that Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> in-laws were born in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Afghanistan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Afghanistan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">citizens</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  
While they did reside for a number of years in Pakistan, they now reside in  Afghanistan (Items 2, B). Again, the frequency of his contact with his in-laws, whether they have any contact of

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is also not known if Applicant has any other financial interest in Afghanistan or whether he keeps in contact with any other individuals in the country. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Finally, Applicant never offered evidence as 
to what he would do if representatives of the Government of Afghanistan threatened his family if he did not cooperate with that Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">           </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given 
"binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither 
automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and 
the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the 
realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General 
Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and othis pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with 
the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based 
on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish 
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of 
such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has 
a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P><P>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's immediate family members, 
including his sister, brother-in-law, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. The citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties 
raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This Applicant has not done. </SPAN></P>
