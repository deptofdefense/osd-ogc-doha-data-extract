<P>Applicant is 38 years old and works in an administrative position for a defense contractor.  Applicant claimed she misread several employment forms she 
completed in 2003, and denied misrepresenting her college education on them.  Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding her personal 
conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On January 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program  </EM><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN>Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">,</SPAN> issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR, which is essentially an administrative complaint, 
detailed reasons under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to the Applicant.  DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing.  She admitted two of the allegations and denied four of them.  She requested a hearing before an administrative judge 
and the case was assigned to me on August 26, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 15, 2005, and the hearing was held on September 30, 
2005.  At the hearing, the Government introduced 16 exhibits into evidence without an objection from the Applicant.  The Applicant did not introduce any 
documents.  Neither party called any witnesses.  I received the Transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on October 11, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In her answer Applicant admitted  the allegations contained in the SOR subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.d. under Guideline E.  She denied the allegations in 
subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f., under  Guideline E.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete review of the evidence 
in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is 38 years old.  She was married in April 1988, and is presently separated from her husband.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Her 16-year-old daughter lives with her.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  From 
December 1989 to November 1992, Applicant and her husband were stationed overseas.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  After they returned to the United States Applicant "took computer 
classes at [a computer institute] from approximately Apr/May 93 to May 94, graduating with a diploma."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  They were again sent overseas in May 1997.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  While 
there Applicant attended college part-time from "approximately August 1997 to December 2000 . . . but did not graduate."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>After returning home in February 2001, Applicant began working for a federal contractor as an administrative assistant.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In the following September, she 
completed a security clearance application (SCA), noting that she had a secret clearance as of August 18, 1997.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In response to Question 5 <EM>(Where You Went To 
School</EM>: <EM>Have you attended school beyond high school?)</EM>, she answered "No,"<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> despite having recently taken college courses overseas.</P> 
<P>Applicant continued to work for the contractor until June 2003, at which time she learned of another position.  According to the job description, the position 
required a bachelor's degree and security clearance.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  On June 3, 2003, Applicant completed an application for the prospective employer.  In the Education 
section, Applicant noted she attended college, wrote "2" under  the heading # of  Years Completed, and inserted "Early Childhood Education" in the 
ajor/Minor column.  Under the heading for Degree/Certificate Received she wrote "Associates" and in the column for Year Awarded she put "2000."  She 
also indicated she attended a computer institute for " 1" year, had a "Business management" major, and received a certificate in "1994."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant presented 
herself as having an associate degree as recorded by the interviewer who wrote "Has an AA vice a Bachelor's degree. That's acceptable to the customer with an 
experience offset which is present."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On June 23, 2003, Applicant filled out another employment form for the company.  She again stated that she attended a state college, majored in "Early 
Childhood Ed.," earned an "Associates," and in the column for Dates Attended, filled in "Associates."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  On that date she also completed a form to verify her 
education.  She listed the name of the college, wrote "Associates" under the heading Highest Degree Attained, inserted "Early Childhood Education" in the 
column for Major, wrote "2000" in the section entitled Year Degree Granted, listed "3.8" as her overall Grade Point Average (GPA), and recorded "09/99 - 5-01" under Dates Attended.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  On July 2, 2003, the college verified her educational credentials. According to the college registrar, Applicant was enrolled in 
1998 for two terms and earned six hours of credit in general studies with a grade point average of 1.20 on a 4.00 scale.  She was also enrolled for four hours in 
the fall semester of 2000, but did not complete the term.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  After receipt of that information, the company phoned the Applicant at work on July 7, 2003, to 
discuss the situation and asked her to investigate the matter.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Applicant left work shortly after that call, claiming she had a personal emergency and an 
uncomfortable office situation.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  She never returned.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  However, on the following day she sent an e-mail to the company, apologizing for abandoning her 
position.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant denied that she left because of the telephone call regarding her education.  However, the circumstances surrounding the abrupt departure 
were undoubtedly related to the call questioning her education, albeit exacerbated by her personal issues.</P> 
<P>On August 21, 2003, Applicant completed an employment form for another company.  In the Education section she listed the name of the college she attended, 
indicated "haven't completed" under the heading of Degree Received and Major, and listed her GPA as "3.6."  She also noted that she had attended a computer 
institute for "1" year, received a "Certificate" and had a GPA of "4.0."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  In the section requesting her employment history, Applicant did not list her prior 
employer because she knew she would not get a good recommendation after she abandoned her job.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  She denied that she withheld information based on the 
company's inquiry about her educational background.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant asserted in a previous interview with a government investigator and during the hearing that she did not falsify any information.  She insisted that she 
misunderstood the questions on the three employment documents.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  She thought the information requested about her education was prospective rather than 
retrospective, i.e., the questions asked what degree she was in the process of obtaining.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  As to her 3.8 GPA, she called it a "guesstimation" because she was 
not sure what grades she earned.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  In explaining this series of events, she said "This is a misunderstanding and has never happened before."  While I believe 
this "misunderstanding" has not happened before, I find her actions were intentional.  Her explanation of misreading the questions is not credible, given the 
clarity of these standard employment questions, as well as her previous administrative work history and training.  I also find her claim that she was unaware of 
her grades at the time she completed the forms incredible.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security 
clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against her.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As noted by the Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v.</EM> <EM>Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), "it should be obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance"<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> and "the 
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  The decision to 
deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept.  It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables.  Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG> <STRONG>A security concern may exist when conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack 
of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="04-06903.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.  The government has established a case under Guideline E.</P> 
<P>Based on the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar</EM> <EM>form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities),</EM> applies to this case.  
Applicant misrepresented her college credentials to an employer in order to obtain employment.  She knew a college degree was a prerequisite for obtaining a 
job and chose to provide false information with the intention to influence the prospective employer.</P> 
<P>Applicant filled out three forms with the same false information and failed to correct the falsifications when given an opportunity in February 2004, in her 
discussion with a government investigator.  Based on this conduct she engaged in a pattern of dishonest behavior, such that PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5. (<EM>A pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency), </EM>also applies to this case. </P> 
<P>I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2. (<EM>The falsification was an isolated 
incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>and, PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. <EM>(The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts). </EM> Neither applies.  This was not an isolated incident as the 
Applicant submitted false information to one employer and withheld information from another.  Applicant did not take the necessary steps to correct the 
falsification.  The truth about Applicant's credentials surfaced as a result of a request for a degree verification and not as the result of Applicant's actions.</P> 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in this case, including Applicant's explanation for the misstatement, her work history, background, age, the burdens of being 
a single mother, and the probability that similar conduct has not occurred in her past and will not occur in the future.  I have also taken into account the "whole 
person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interest.  However, all of those factors are insufficient to mitigate the 
security concerns regarding her personal conduct under these circumstances.  Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is not consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.  Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
<P>Paragraph 1 Guideline E (Personal Conduct):     AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P>
