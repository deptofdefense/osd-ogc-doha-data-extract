<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies, including a child support arrearage, failures to file federal income tax returns, and unpaid tax liens.  He 
mistakenly answered "no" to three questions on his security clearance application (SF 86) about bankruptcy filings, unpaid tax liens, and unpaid judgments.  He 
refuted the allegations of intentionally falsifying his SF 86, but he failed to mitigate the security concern based on financial considerations.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to 
deny Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  Under 
Guideline F, it alleges Applicant filed two petitions for Chapter 13 bankruptcy that were both dismissed (SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b.); and he owes a child support 
arrearage of about $24,735 (&para; 3.c.), a hospital bill of about $167 (&para; 1.e.), unpaid rent (&para; 1.f.), and unsatisfied federal tax liens for several tax years (&para;&para; 1.d.,1.g., 
and 1.h.).  Under Guideline E, it alleges he falsified his answers on his SF 86 regarding bankruptcies (&para; 2.a.). tax liens (&para; 2.b.), and unpaid judgments (&para; 2.c.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 31, 2005.  He admitted the allegations under Guideline F except for the hospital bill and unpaid rent (SOR &para;&para; 
1.e. and 1.f.), and he denied all the allegations of falsification under Guideline E.  He requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 22, 2005 and heard on December 19, 2005 as scheduled.  I kept the record open until January 31, 2006, to enable 
Applicant to obtain and submit evidence regarding his delinquent federal taxes.  Applicant submitted additional evidence, and it is incorporated in the record as 
Applicant's Exhibit (AX) D.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 5, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 50-year-old facility security officer for a federal contractor.  He has held a clearance and worked for federal contractors for almost 20 years.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He 
has eleven years of formal education, and he obtained his General Educational Development (GED) certificate while serving on active duty in the U.S. Army 
from November 1972 until June 1980.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He is married and has two children from the marriage.  He also has two children from a previous relationship.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early 1991, Applicant purchased a townhouse jointly with a woman with whom he was living and had two children.  They separated, and he was left 
responsible for the mortgage payments.  He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in November 1991.  When his attorney advised him the bankruptcy could 
adversely affect his security clearance, he dismissed the bankruptcy and allowed the lender to foreclose on the property.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Shortly after his former companion left him, she obtained a court order requiring him to pay $400 per month for their two children.  He questioned the paternity 
of the children, but blood tests established he was the father.  He did not pay the child support during the six months he contested paternity, thereby 
accumulating an arrearage he was financially unable to pay.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Judgments were entered against him in August 2000, October 2002, and June 2003 for the child 
support arrearage, which was about $24,735 in 2003.  The children are now adults, and he is paying only the arrearage. His pay is being garnished for $400 per 
month to satisfy the arrearage, which has been reduced to about $20,926.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant purchased the townhouse, he withdrew funds from his retirement account, without realizing the funds would be taxable income.  He did not 
file federal income tax returns in 1991 and 1992, because he could not afford to pay the income taxes on the proceeds from his retirement account.  A tax lien 
for about $11,095 was filed against him in February 1997.  In December 2001, two additional liens were filed.  The first was for about $8,761 for tax years 
1993 and 1994, and the second was for about $1,208 for tax years 1998 and 1999.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  A refund of $2,062 for tax year 2003 was applied to his delinquent taxes.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  
When he was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2004, he was not making any payments on the delinquent taxes.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Some time after August 2004, a 
tax levy was placed on his wages.  The levy was released in January 2005 because of his low income.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Until the levy was released, payments on the delinquent 
taxes were being deducted from his wages.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A judgment for $167 was entered against Applicant in October 1997 for an emergency medical bill.  He testified his wife paid the judgment, but they no longer 
have any record of payment, because his wife destroyed the cancelled checks covering that period.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a second Chapter 13 petition in July 1999, because he was financially overextended and owed federal income taxes.  He dismissed this petition 
after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which had placed a lien on his home, refused to agree to a payment plan.  The lender foreclosed on this home when 
Applicant was unable to make his hosue payments.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant suffers from a heart defect that caused him to suffer two strokes, the first in April-May 2000 and the second about a year later.  In September 2002, he 
was laid off.  For a while, he worked part-time, earning about $40,000 per year.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He returned to full-time work with a new employer in April 2005, earning 
$55,000 per year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until recently, Applicant's monthly take-home pay was about $3,000, after deduction of the child support arrearage payments.  He has no car payments, home 
mortgage payments, or credit card accounts.  His net monthly remainder is usually about $200.  He has no savings and no vested retirement accounts.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He 
recently received a pay raise of about $3,000 per year.  He hopes to use the raise to negotiate a new payment plan with the IRS.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  I held the record open to 
enable him to produce evidence of a payment plan.  On January 31, 2006, he submitted copies of a bill from the IRS for $1,439.30 and copies of postal money 
orders for that amount.  It is unclear whether the bill and payment are intended to show full satisfaction of a tax debt, an unscheduled partial payment, or the 
beginning of a negotiated settlement of his tax liability.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A judgment was entered against Applicant for unpaid rent in May 2001 (SOR &para; 1.f.).  He disputed the debt.  He testified he contacted the apartment manager, 
told the manager he had never lived in the city and state where the apartment was located, and learned the delinquent renter was a person with the same first and 
last name but a different middle initial and social security number.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant executed a SF 86 on June 24, 2003.  He answered "no" to questions 33 (bankruptcy petitions in the last seven years), 36 (tax liens in the last seven 
years), and 37 (unpaid judgments in the last seven years).  However, he disclosed the tax liens in response to question 34 (wage garnishments), and a home 
mortgage foreclosure in response to questions 35 (repossessions) and 38 (debts more than 180 days delinquent).<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  He testified he was unaware of the unpaid 
judgments for child support, medical services, and unpaid rent when he executed his SF 86.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his answers to questions 33, 36, and 37.  He testified he "done the cardinal sin" (sic) by rushing through the 
questionnaire.  He did not disclose the second bankruptcy, preceding his SF 86 by only four years, because he hurried through the application and inadvertently 
omitted it.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He disclosed the second bankruptcy when questioned by a security investigator in August 2004.<A HREF="05-01856.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants

the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where 
an applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Applicant's financial history establishes both DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant has multiple delinquent debts that are not yet fully resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems also can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions "largely beyond the person's control" (MC 
3).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to conditions beyond his control, those conditions are not necessarily 
mitigating unless Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties.  ISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The breakup of Applicant's relationship in 1991 left him solely responsible for making the payments on his townhouse.  He had already made a foolish 
financial decision to invade his retirement funds to buy the townhouse, not realizing the tax consequences.  He lost his investment when the lender foreclosed 
on the townhouse.  He accumulated a child support arrearage almost immediately after the breakup by not paying child support for six months while he 
contested paternity.  Because he was financially overextended, he did not file his federal income tax returns for two years.  There is no evidence he requested an 
extension of time to file his returns or took any steps to negotiate a settlement with the IRS.  He lost another home to foreclosure in 1999.  He suffered two 
strokes in 2000 and 2001, causing him to be laid off from work and unable to work full-time for a substantial period.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The breakup of his relationship was a condition beyond his control.  However, his financial difficulties were largely the result of buying a house he could not 
afford, not considering the tax consequences of withdrawing his retirement funds, incurring penalties and interest for failing to file his federal income tax 
returns for two years, and buying a second house he could not afford.  Applicant's illness in 2000-2001 certainly was beyond his control, but he was already in 
dire financial straits when it occurred.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the 
government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  I conclude Applicant has not established MC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant paid off the medical bill and justifiably disputed the judgment for unpaid rent.  
However, there is little evidence of voluntary actions to pay the child support arrearage or unpaid income taxes.  Any payments on those obligations were the 
result of involuntary measures such as garnishments of his wages and imposition of tax liens.  After the hearing, Applicant presented evidence of a substantial 
payment to the IRS, but he submitted no evidence of a final settlement or long-term payment agreement.  His recent pay increase makes more money available 
to pay past due obligations, but insufficient time has elapsed for Applicant to establish a track record of systematically resolving his past due obligations.  I 
conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of establishing MC 6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's life has been a financial struggle since at least 1991.  At the hearing he seemed honest and sincere, but he has a track record of bad financial 
judgment and neglect of his obligations.  He has not presented sufficient evidence to convince me he has changed his financial habits.  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concern 
based on financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. A disqualifying condition (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is 
direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time of the omission.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 
2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR &para; 2.a. alleges Applicant falsified his SF 86 by not disclosing his bankruptcy filing in 1999.  Applicant denied intentional falsification.  His only 
explanation for omitting the 4-year-old bankruptcy filing was that he made the "cardinal sin" of hurrying through the execution of the form.  At first blush, this 
explanation seems weak and implausible in light of his long experience as a facility security officer.  On the other hand, he disclosed considerable derogatory 
information on his SF 86, and the bankruptcy filing had little security significance in itself, because it merely reflected his financial distress disclosed elsewhere 
in the SF 86.  His other derogatory disclosures in response to the wrong questions, e.g., disclosing tax liens in response to the question about garnishments and 
disclosing mortgage foreclosures in response to the question about repossessions, reflect either inattention or confusion.  He impressed me as honest, 
unguarded, and very sincere at the hearing, but he also seemed befuddled when questioned about the omissions from his SF 86.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His inaccurate execution of his 
SF 86 was consistent with his inattentive and erratic approach to financial management.  I am satisfied his omission of the 1999 bankruptcy filing was the 
product of negligence, but was not an intentional falsification.  Accordingly, I conclude he has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 2.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also neglected to disclose the federal tax liens in response to question 36 (liens placed against property during last seven years).  However, he 
disclosed his wages were subject to a tax levy under question 34 (garnishments).  I am satisfied this response also is a product of negligence or confusion, but 
not an intentional falsification.  I conclude he has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 2.b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant neglected to disclose unpaid judgments against him for the child support arrearage, a medical bill, and unpaid rent.  He testified he was 
unaware of the judgments.  He also testified his wife had paid the medical bill, and he had been informed by the apartment manager that the judgment for 
unpaid rent was against another person with the same first and last names.  I conclude he has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 2.c.</SPAN></P>
