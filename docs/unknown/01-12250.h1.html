<P>Applicant has revoked her Taiwanese citizenship and surrendered her passport.  Her family connections are not of a type that would make her vulnerable to 
coercion or pressure.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 26, 2001, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on December 19, 2001.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any 
documents in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on January 2, 2002, and submitted a response on January 3, 2002 
(Applicant's Exhibit O)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The Department Counsel did not object to the admissibility of the additional material.  The case was received by the undersigned on 
February 7, 2002.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 31, married and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks to obtain or retain a DoD security 
clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the 
live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has acted 
in such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1971.  She moved to the United States to attend school in approximately 1991.  The Applicant became a naturalized 
American citizen on July 26, 1996.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her Security Clearance Application (Government Exhibit 4), the Applicant stated "Yes" to question 3 where it asks "Are you now or were you a dual citizen 
of the U.S. and another country?"  The Applicant also possessed a Taiwanese passport at the time of the issuance of the SOR.  (Applicant's Exhibit B.)  At the 
time of the issuance of the Taiwanese passport the Applicant was not working in the defense sector.  The Applicant has never traveled on the Taiwanese 
passport.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 1-2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated in her Answer to the SOR that she was taking steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship.  Applicant's Exhibit E is a copy of her 
application to renounce that citizenship.  It is in Chinese.  Applicant's Exhibit O consists of a letter from the Applicant, as well as a photocopy of a Certificate 
on Permission to Renounce Nationality from Taiwan and a notarized English translation.  The translation indicates that, on November 16, 2001, the Domestic 
Affairs Administration of the Republic of China (Taiwan) granted permission for the Applicant to renounce her citizenship.  In her letter of January 3, 2002, the 
Applicant states, "I returned my Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese Government before it issued me this Certificate of Permission to Renounce Nationality." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign influence)</SPAN>.   The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has 
immediate family members or people to whom she may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to 
duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's father is the member of her family to whom she is closest.   Her father was a permanent resident of the United States from 1996 to 1999.  
(Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)  He returned to Taiwan for medical treatment.  (Applicant's Exhibit G.)  The Applicant made arrangements for her father to return 
to the United States in December 2001.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 2; Applicant's Exhibit H.)  The Applicant is not close to her mother and brother, but she is 
beginning to make arrangements for them to join her in the United States.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 2; Government Exhibit 5 at 2; Applicant's Exhibit N.)  She 
last visited Taiwan in December 1994-January 1995.  None of her family members work for the Taiwanese government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is now married.  Her husband has submitted his application for adjustment of his status to that of lawful permanent resident.  (Applicant Exhibits 
I and J.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted documentation to show that she is an active American citizen.  (Applicant's Exhibits C and D.)  She stated, "I never fulfilled any 
duties to Taiwanese government as a citizen; but I have been a law-biding citizen of the U.S. since my naturalization."  (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her sworn statement the Applicant says, "I consider myself to be a U.S. citizen.  I like being in the U.S. [T]here are more opportunities for women in the U.S.  
I have lived here a long time, my home is here and I would consider it immoral to act against the best interest of the U.S.  I am willing to defend the 
constitution.  I would not use my position of trust to serve the interests of Taiwan or any other country."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 4.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case 
are:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B (Foreign influence)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C (Foreign preference)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additional policy guidance regarding the possession of a foreign passport is also found in the August 16, 2000, Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence entitled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application 
of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline."  (Money Memorandum.)  (Government Exhibit 7.)  In pertinent part the Memorandum states, "[C]onsistent 
application of the [Foreign Preference] guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains 
official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be a dual citizen or have foreign connections that demonstrates untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has foreign connections, that she was a dual citizen 
of Taiwan and the United States, and that she possessed a Taiwanese passport after she became an American citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation and mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome the Government's 
case against her.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that the Applicant has successfully revoked her Taiwanese citizenship effective November 16, 2001.  Before the revocation could take 
effect the Applicant had to return her Taiwanese passport.  Accordingly, she has more than fulfilled the requirements of the Money Memorandum.  In addition, 
other than her possession of a passport, there is no evidence that the Applicant ever exercised dual citizenship with Taiwan.  Guideline C is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to Guideline B, one finds that the Applicant is now married to her fianc&eacute;, and he has applied for permanent residency in the United States.  Her father is 
once again living in the United States.  The evidence is clear that her mother and brother, who currently reside in Taiwan but will soon relocate to the United 
States, are not agents of a foreign government or in a position to be influenced by that government.  A common sense evaluation of the overall facts and 
circumstances of the Applicant's family ties persuasively shows that the Applicant is not in a position to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Guideline B is 
found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
