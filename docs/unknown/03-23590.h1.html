<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On December 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline H (drugs) and Guideline E (personal conduct) which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated December 27, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant 
material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision.  Applicant received the FORM on March 7, 2005.  Applicant was afforded the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by April 6, 2005.  Applicant declined to submit a response to the 
FORM.  The case was  assigned to me on May 11, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted to all seven of the SOR allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Guideline H (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.), and denied the 
three allegations of personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a. and b.). Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a married 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He was employed by this contractor in 1981.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  He 
obtained a security clearance in 1980.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He has a history of marijuana and cocaine abuse.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He cultivated and purchased these substances and used them during 
employment with a defense contractor from 1986 until at least April 28, 2001.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant had avoided detection of his drug use by his employer's random drug 
screens.  He was aware that his drug abuse was illegal.  His wife was aware of his drug abuse and had requested that he seek help.  In April 2001, he admitted 
his dependence and contacted his health insurance provider for assistance.  He was directed to a chemical dependency center.  After working hours, he attended 
one hour counseling sessions three times each  week and two group meetings per week  He was subjected to random drug screens that often occurred twice per 
week.  All exams were negative.  His sobriety date is April 28, 2001.  He successfully completed the program in early August 2001, and has stated that he has 
abstained from illegal drug use since then.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not seek treatment through his company's Employee Assistance Program (EAP).  He states that no 
other employee of his company knew of his prior drug use.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  </P> 
<P>Applicant has denied that he intentionally falsified his March 2003 security clearance application.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN>  His reply to question<EM> " <STRONG>27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and 
Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs</STRONG>.  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for 
example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, 
methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs</EM>?" was "Yes", that he used marijuana from February 4, 1996 to April 
28, 2001.  He omitted his cocaine use during that same period. He stated that he was under pressure from his employer's security representative to finish filling 
out his security questionnaire because the original form had been lost, and that he was working in his office where there was no privacy and people were 
constantly interrupting him.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>On that same security clearance questionnaire,  he was required to answer question<EM> "<STRONG>28. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive 
Positions</STRONG>.  Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while 
possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety?</EM>"  He answered: "No."<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He gave the same reasons 
as his response to question 27.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN>  A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
<P>Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </P> 
<P>Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline H (drug involvement) (DI), Directive, &para; E2.A8.1.1. <EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions 
regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, 
increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information</EM>; <EM> </EM>and Guideline E (personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. <EM>Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The Government has established its case under Guideline H.  Applicant admitted the use of marijuana and cocaine over more than a 15-year period, ending 
when he entered a drug counseling program in April 2001.  Disqualifying Conditions DI include E2.A8.1.2.1 <EM>Conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying include</EM>: [1] E2.A8.1.2.1.<EM> (Any drug abuse)</EM>; and [2] E2.A8.1.2.2. (<EM>Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>) are applicable in this case.  The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an 
applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk 
of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The cultivation, purchase and use classify Applicant as an abuser.  It is interesting to note that Applicant 
did not seek treatment with his company's EAP.  From his statement that no other employee at his employer knew of his drug abuse it can be reasonably 
inferred  that Applicant did not want his employer to know of his drug habit.</P> 
<P>The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  However, such silence does not means I have unfettered discretion in 
deciding what period of time is sufficient to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation. The sufficiency or insufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without 
recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather a 
reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence record within the parameters 
set by the Directive.  Applicant's last use occurred approximately two years before he gave his sworn statement which is recent use.  Applicant has expressed he 
will not use illegal drugs in the future. Even if an applicant is sincere that he has no intention of using drugs in the future, I am not precluded from considering 
his statement in light of the record evidence as a whole in deciding whether the applicant is likely to adhere to such a commitment in the future. As a matter of 
common sense and human experience, people do not always successfully adhere to the promise to reform or change their conduct or lifestyle.  I have not had the 
opportunity to personally observe Applicant and evaluate his demeanor or veracity and make a favorable credibility determination. Therefore, I cannot make a 
favorable determination concerning his future intent. </P> 
<P>Applicant used marijuana and cocaine over a 15-year time span.  Applicant believes he had developed a mild dependence on the drug.  The record contains no 
medical evidence to either confirm or discount a dependence.  His drug involvement was neither an isolated nor an aberrational event. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From April 28, 2001, 
through early August 2001, Applicant received treatment. From the evidence, I am unable to determine whether Applicant has satisfactorily completed a 
"prescribed drug treatment program", including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse.  Furthermore, there is no favorable 
prognosis by a credentialed medical professional. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions apply.  I find against Applicant as to Drug Involvement</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, SOR 
subparagraphs 1.a. through g. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  questions on his security clearance applications by omitting his use of cocaine during admitted 
periods of marijuana use, and his denial of using drugs while holding a security clearance.  These come under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2.<EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant explained his answers by saying that he was under pressure from his 
employer's security representative to finish filling out his security questionnaire because the original form he filled out was lost.  He was working in a public 
work environment that had little or no privacy, and that he inadvertently omitted listing his cocaine usage on question 27 and drug usage on question 28.<A HREF="03-23590.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I do 
not find these reasons persuasive.  Applicant stated that no other employee knew of his drug abuse.  He chose not to enter his employer's EAP.  This gives the 
appearance of an effort to conceal his drug use, especially while holding a security clearance, from his employer. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel.  The government 
has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision.  The government relies on 
applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information.  Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some 
indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to 
perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of 
legitimate government interests.  I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the   factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
