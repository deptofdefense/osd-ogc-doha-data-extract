<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></P>

<P>On August 13, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer
to the SOR on August 22, 1996. </P>

<P>The case was received by the undersigned on November 18, 1996. A notice of hearing was issued on November 27, 1996, and the case was heard on December
16, 1996. The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from Applicant and two witnesses. The transcript was received on
December 27, 1996.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</STRONG></U></P>

<P>At the hearing, Applicant objected to the introduction of Government Exhibits (GE) #4  through #8 into evidence because the medical records are covered by the
doctor-patient privilege. Applicant's objection was overruled on two grounds. The first is that the Defense Investigative Service Special Agent obtained a signed
release from Applicant which authorized Agent to secure the original or copy of the actual records or synopsis of record information. (Tr. 14-15). The signed
release waives the privilege. The second ground is based on the national interest, which allows the Government to make an inquiry into an applicant's
background where the information sought has a legitimate connection to an applicant's fitness for having a security clearance. Applicant's hospitalizations
concerning his alcohol dependence/addiction bears a logical and legal connection to his suitability for safeguarding classified information.</P>

<P>Applicant also objected to GE #4, #5, #6, #7, and #8 because the documents are hearsay. Applicant's objection was overruled. Notwithstanding the hearsay
nature of medical records, they are admissible on the same basis as other regularly kept business records. Medical records are considered to be inherently
reliable because people who seek treatment are likely to furnish truthful information to medical personnel to obtain the most appropriate treatment, and medical
personnel regularly record facts (generally called history) concerning the patient, and routinely use these facts in determining a diagnosis, prognosis and/or most
appropriate course of treatment for the patient. In addition, there is independent evidence in the record which clearly increases the reliability and probative value
of the medical records. (GE #4, #5, #6, #7, #8).</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>

<P>The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The SOR alleges excessive alcohol
consumption (Criterion G). Applicant denied subparagraphs 1a and 1d and admitted subparagraphs 1b and 1c. Applicant's admissions shall be incorporated in
the following Findings of Fact.</P>

<P>Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a ---------------- for a defense contractor. He seeks a secret level clearance. </P>

<P>While there is some conflicting evidence regarding how long Applicant has used alcohol to excess, I find Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption began in at
least 1990 and not in January 1996,<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> or November 1994 when he was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI).<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> The previous finding is
also based on Applicant's intentional omissions of the full nature and scope of his drinking history in GE #2.<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">On November 13, 1994, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and improper lane change. Applicant pled guilty to DWI and received a
suspended imposition of sentence and was placed on probation for 2 years. Applicant will be discharged from probation in January 1997. (GE #3). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant received treatment from January 16, 1995 to January 21, 1995 for alcohol dependence. About four or five months after his discharge from outpatient
treatment, he resumed drinking non-alcoholic drinks and then progressed to mixed drinks but he never drank during the week. (Tr. 43-44). His wife also noted
that throughout his alcohol history he never consumed alcohol during the week, just on the weekends and vacations. (Tr. 77).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">From January 17, 1996 to January 21, 1996, Applicant received treatment for alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol liver disease.
Applicant failed to attend aftercare.<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> In addition, he had no sponsor as of the time of the hearing.<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> In April 1996, Applicant's treating doctor provided a
guarded prognosis because Applicant minimized his condition during the course of treatment and did not follow up with the treating doctor. (GE #7). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant has been employed at his present job for the last 17&frac12; years and has a good relationship with his supervisors. (Tr. 31, 35). Alcohol has never interfered
with his job. (Tr. 42). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">When Applicant was discharged from detoxification in January 1996, he attended AA three times a week for the first three or four months and now attends once
a week. (Tr. 37). He uses the Big Book and knows the Serenity Prayer. (Tr. 56; 63). He has been exposed to all the Steps in the Step Program but is working on
Step 1. (Tr. 55; 57). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">His wife believes Applicant attends 2 AA meetings a week and she occasionally attends with him although she could not remember what Step Applicant was
working. (Tr. 76; 84). Applicant has consumed no alcohol since he left detoxification in January 1996. In addition to being supportive, Applicant's wife attended
several outpatient meetings in February 1996. (GE #8).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant's coworker for 17 years considers Applicant has average or above average work habits. (TR. 86). He sees Applicant about four times a week but not
on a daily basis and only for short periods of time when they work overtime together or on a shift change. (Tr. 89). Applicant never talked with him about his
drinking habits, or that he had treatment, or that he was an alcoholic, until approximately two months before the hearing. (Tr. 89-90).</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">POLICIES</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must
be considered in every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U> <U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor
can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the
trier of fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation of the facts in this case are:</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">Excessive Alcohol Consumption (Criterion G)</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors Against Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">3. diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">4. habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">5. Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation
program. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors for Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">None.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of
Enclosure 2 of the Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">Burden of Proof</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available
information, both favorable and unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of a security clearance under this
Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the
future. The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge
cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion G (excessive alcohol consumption) which establishes doubt about a person's
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past
adverse conduct is unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Government has established a case of excessive alcohol consumption within the scope of Criterion G.<A HREF="96-0575.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> Applicant's alcohol dependence is well documented
in the medical records. Applicant pled guilty to DWI (Factor #1 Against Clearance) and was sentenced to a suspended sentence and two years probation in
January 1995. He also entered treatment in January 1995 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence (Factor #3 Against Clearance). Within four or five months of
discharge from treatment, Applicant resumed drinking non-alcoholic beverages and, at some point, switched to alcohol (Factor #4 and #5 Against Clearance)
until he reached the levels set forth in the medical records of January 1996 which charted his detoxification treatment for alcohol dependence, alcohol
withdrawal, and alcohol liver disease. (Factor #5 Against Clearance). More importantly, the  treatment records in January 1995 and January 1996, as well as GE
#2, are clearly significant in demonstrating the denial Applicant demonstrated in deceiving himself about the reality of his excessive alcohol consumption.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT FACE="Times">While there is evidence of only one alcohol-related incident in November 1994, Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption has been evident since at least 1990.
He has intentionally provided less than the full picture of his alcohol abuse in October 1995, April 1996, and at the hearing. Furthermore, his alcohol abuse did
not end until January 17, 1996 when he entered the detoxification program. The favorable evidence of Applicant's AA participation must be balanced against the
fact the affiliation has only been for eleven months. In addition, besides the evidence of AA participation, which was confirmed by his wife, there is little
evidence of any other changes in Applicant's lifestyle to ensure his past alcohol abuse will not repeat itself in the future. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT FACE="Times">Given Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption since at least 1990 (even though his excessive abuse occurred entirely on the weekend or vacations), his
intentional falsification of the true scope of his problem, and the guarded prognosis from his treating doctor in April 1996, Applicant's complimentary character
evidence from his coworker, and his wife, along with his own testimony, is not enough to satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion under Criterion G. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A><FONT SIZE="-1"> In GE #3, Applicant stated he discovered he had a problem in November 1994 when he was arrested for DWI. Even though his wife was aware of an alcohol problem for about five years
(Tr. 79), Applicant  admitted having a 30 year history of alcoholism (GE #6) which began just before the alcohol problems associated with his first marriage. (GE #4). In addition, Applicant
indicated prior to his admission in January 1996 for detoxification he had a problem with alcohol for years, was having blackouts and shakes, had been drinking 6 beers and 6 mixed drinks per
day on the weekend and was drinking constantly while on vacation, and had not eaten in the past 4 days while binge drinking. (GE #8).</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">
