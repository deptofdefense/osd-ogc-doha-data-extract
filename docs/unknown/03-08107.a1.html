  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Applicant's right to have a hearing does not mean that he is entitled to have multiple hearings in his case.  Furthermore, nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or general principles of federal administrative law gives the parties a right to supplement  the record evidence continuously.  Given the record evidence of Applicant's history of financial difficulties, the Judge was not compelled, as a matter of law, to  conclude that the evidence presented by Applicant concerning his job performance and employment history was sufficient to rebut, mitigate, or extenuate the  security concerns raised by his overall history of financial difficulties.  Under the Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional security clearance.  The  possible adverse effect of an unfavorable decision on Applicant's economic situation is not relevant or material to whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary,  capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 29, 2004, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr. issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated March 7, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether Applicant should be allowed another opportunity to present additional evidence on his behalf; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties warranted an unfavorable security clearance decision; 
and (3) whether Applicant can be granted a security clearance to allow him the opportunity to demonstrate he will address and resolve his remaining debts.  For 
the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief relies heavily on offers of new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Apart from offering new evidence on appeal, Applicant makes various arguments that the Board construe as raising three issues on 
appeal: (1) whether Applicant should be allowed another opportunity to present additional evidence on his behalf; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred 
by concluding Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties warranted an unfavorable security clearance decision; and (3) whether Applicant can be 
granted a security clearance to allow him the opportunity to demonstrate he will address and resolve his remaining debts.<A HREF="03-08107.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant should be allowed another opportunity to present additional evidence on his behalf</SPAN>.  Apart from offering new evidence on appeal, 
Applicant asks for "another chance to clarify and explain why my Security Clearance should be restored."  Applicant's right to have a hearing<A HREF="03-08107.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> does not mean 
that he is entitled to have multiple hearings in his case.  Furthermore, nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or general principles of federal 
administrative law gives the parties a right to supplement the record evidence continuously.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (February 13, 2001) at pp. 3-4 
(the right to present evidence in DOHA proceedings must be exercised within provisions of the Directive and the practical need for administrative finality in 
these proceedings)(<EM>citing Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</EM>., 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 (1978)).  Applicant is not 
entitled to have his case remanded just so he can have another chance to present his case to the Judge.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties warranted an unfavorable security clearance 
decision</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts "I am not a threat or liability to any company or task that I am assigned," and that he has provided and can continue to provide 
technical services in support of the national security is he is allowed to retain a security clearance.  The Board construes those assertions as raising the issue of 
whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties warranted an unfavorable security clearance decision.</P> 
<P>Although evidence about an applicant's job performance and employment history can be relevant to a whole person analysis of the applicant's security 
eligibility, such evidence is not dispositive of a case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-26723 (November 30, 2004) at p. 3 (security clearance adjudications are not 
limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct on the job or during duty hours).  A history of financial difficulties raises security concerns that can provide a 
rational basis for an unfavorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-13281 (October 22, 2004) at p. 4 (discussing security significance of 
a history of financial difficulties).  Given the record evidence of Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties over many years, it was not arbitrary or 
capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's history of financial difficulties raised security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) that 
warranted an unfavorable security clearance decision.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge was not compelled, as a matter of law, to conclude that the 
evidence presented by Applicant concerning his job performance and employment history was sufficient to rebut, mitigate, or extenuate the security concerns 
raised by his overall history of financial difficulties.<A HREF="03-08107.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted a security clearance to allow him the opportunity to demonstrate he will address and resolve his remaining debts</SPAN>.  
Applicant asks to given a security clearance "so that I will have the opportunity to apply for positions in the classified field again.  This will only help me in 
paying all debts."  This request could be construed as either (a) a request for a conditional security clearance; or (b) an argument that the Administrative Judge's 
unfavorable security clearance should not be affirmed because it will result in adverse financial consequences for Applicant.</P> 
<P>Under the Directive, there is no authority for a Hearing Office Administrative Judge or the Board to grant a conditional security clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 02-32842 (November 29, 2004) at p. 4.  Moreover, the possible effect a security clearance decision could have on Applicant's economic situation is not 
relevant or material to whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (May 19, 2004) at p. 8.  
Accordingly, Applicant requests relief to which he is not entitled.</P> 
<P>Applicant asks for information regarding reapplication.  The Board refers Applicant to the provisions of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.37 - E3.1.41.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
