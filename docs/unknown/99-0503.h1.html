<P>On July 30, 1999, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should
be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 11, 1999, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in
lieu of a hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on September 27,
1999.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received
the FORM on October 5, 1999, and he submitted no response.</P>

<P>The case was transferred to the undersigned for resolution on November 5, 1999. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of  the 1992 Directive sets
forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making
security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the
conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these
factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors
most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P>

<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P>

<P>3. an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P>

<P>None.</P>

<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the
Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</P>

<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DOD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the
ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an
Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P>

<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard
such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information
indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct, which demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness or
unreliability.</P>

<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative
determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual
meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole
person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in
reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in
the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. 
Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard
such sensitive information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when
available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates poor
judgment or unreliability.</P>

<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the
Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the
Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's
case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or
her a security clearance.</P>

<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by evidence that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline
F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient
to overcome the Government's case. </P>

<P>The record evidence establishes that the Applicant has engaged in a pattern and history of  financial irresponsibility.  Following his
bankruptcy in 1991, the Applicant has continued to have difficulties meeting his financial obligations.  Although he has made some effort,
indicated by the fact that he has paid off his back child support, he remains indebted in the approximate amount of $24,000.00, for past due
indebtedness, that includes numerous collection accounts and two court judgments.  For many years, he has simply ignored his debts, and
made no effort to pay them.  Despite his good intentions to pay them now, there is no convincing evidence that he will.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant has also failed to respond to the File of Relevant Material, which leaves the record silent on the issue of rehabilitation. 
Although the Applicant shows some sensitivity to his past financial behavior, it is not clear that the Applicant has gained the necessary insight
into the seriousness of his conduct, or whether he is prepared to act responsibly in the future.  He continues to owe a large amount of money
to his past due creditors.  I cannot say that he is unlikely to repeat his irresponsible conduct.  I find that the Applicant's financial
irresponsibility was not isolated, is recent, and continuing, and could recur in the future.  Accordingly, Guideline F, is found against the
Applicant.</P>

<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance. 
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of
the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.a.: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Subpara.  1.b.: For the Applicant.</P>
