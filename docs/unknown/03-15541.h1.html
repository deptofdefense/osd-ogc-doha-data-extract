<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old project leader employed by a defense contractor.  He has a history of alcohol consumption concerns as a result of his being arrested 
for driving under the influence in 1978, 1992, 1999, and 2002.  Applicant has made substantial life style changes supportive of sobriety, submitted evidence he 
is not alcohol dependent, and successfully petitioned the court to set aside his 2002 DUI conviction based on his positive behavior changes.  Applicant has 
mitigated this concern.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 22, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-15541.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 18, 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 
ay 21, 2004.  On July 1, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on July 14, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed with his current employer, a defense contractor, since October 2000 as a project leader.  He is seeking a security clearance for an 
enhanced position with his employer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 47 years old and the father of two children, a daughter 22 years old, and a son 16 years old.  He maintains a positive relationship with the mother of 
his two children and remains active and involved with his children.  He has completed approximately three years of college credit and continues to attend 
classes. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served on active duty in the U. S. Navy for four years from September 1977 to September 1981, and was honorably discharged as a Interior 
Communications Seaman, pay grade E-3.  He held a top secret clearance while attached to a submarine.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arose surrounding Applicant's four alcohol-related incidents and are discussed in order.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 22, 1978, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI) in State A.  He was sentenced to one day of 
confinement and fined $244.00.  At the time of this arrest, Applicant had been in the Navy approximately five months, was home on leave, and was out with 
hometown friends.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 29, 1992, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving while under  the influence in State A.  He was sentenced to one day of 
confinement, fined $445.00, and a 90-day license suspension.  At the time of this arrest, Applicant had been celebrating his birthday at a local nightclub.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 24, 1999, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving while intoxicated in State B.  He pled nolo contendere and was sentenced to six 
months probation, fined $500.00, and assessed $254.25 court costs.  Applicant was also required to attend DUI school.  At the time of this arrest, Applicant had 
just been laid off from his job and went to a local bar before going home.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 20, 2002, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving under the influence and driving under the influence with alcohol 
concentration of .10 or more in State A.  Applicant pled guilty to the lesser charge of DUI and the DUI with alcohol concentration of .10 or more was 
dismissed.  Applicant was frequenting a local dance club, had four rum and Cokes, and was pulled over for driving 35 MPH in a 25 MPH zone.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two events had a profound impact on Applicant following his September 2002 conviction for DUI.  First, Applicant called the mother of his children in the 
middle of the night to pick him up from jail after his arrest.  She arrived at jail, accompanied by their two children, his daughter who was then 18 years old, and 
his son, who was then 13 years old.  He testified, "I had always kept on them about drinking and driving, alcohol use, drug use.  And walking out of jail with 
them there and seeing that hypocrite type look really is what's gotten me past this whole thing. . . . But their faces when, you know, dad comes out of jail.  That 
was pretty tough."  Tr. 35-36.  "I now saw them (his children) as possible victims of my actions because since they with their mother I could have easily caused 
them harm, death, as well as the public at large."  Tr. 42.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Second, Applicant was required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) impact panel.  Applicant testified "this was the first time where I actually 
sat with somebody and talked to them face to face who had a tragedy because of an impaired driver."  Tr. 34.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant on his own volition sought the services of a certified professional counselor for an alcohol screening.  The counselor reported by letter dated 
November 25, 2002, , "The score on the SASSI (copy enclosed) rates [Applicant] as a low probability for having an alcohol dependence disorder.  His test 
results appear valid and therefore provide a good indicator of his present relationship to alcohol.  In summary, [Applicant] does not present as an individual who 
has a significant alcohol abuse problem.  There does not seem to be a propensity for alcoholism and/or any other substance dependency."  Response to SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2003, Applicant successfully petitioned the Court to set aside his September 2002 DUI conviction.  Applicant's last drink was at a family Christmas 
party in December 2002 when he had wine with dinner.  Since then, he has been alcohol free.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a trusted and highly valued employee of his company.  In fact, he is so highly regarded, his employer is holding his position open pending the 
outcome of his security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had consumed alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication (&para; 1.a), and had been arrested, charged, and convicted of 
four driving under the influence offenses in 1978, 1992, 1999, and 2002 (&para; 1.b - 1.e).  The security concern is excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the 
exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to 
carelessness.  Directive &para; E2.A7.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR-Applicant consumed alcohol to excess and 
to the point of intoxication and had been arrested, charged, and convicted of four DUIs.  DC E2.A71.2 and DC E2.A71.5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's DUIs span a 24 year period with significant gaps between each offense, with perhaps the exception of the third and fourth DUI.  Although 
Applicant's four DUIs cannot be condoned, several items are worthy of note.  Applicant credibly and convincingly testified regarding the profound affect his 
2002 DUI had on him.  His reaction included a combination of shame and guilt especially as it pertained to how his children viewed him.  Having the mother of 
his children bring them to jail in the middle of the night to see their father released from jail had a profound impact on him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant further followed up with court imposed attendance at the MADD impact panel.  Although court imposed, Applicant participated enthusiastically in 
the program and derived maximum benefit from attending.  Applicant fully comprehended the lasting and adverse consequences of harm inflicted on innocent 
people by drunk drivers.  Furthermore, following his last DUI in 2002, Applicant on his own volition sought out the professional services of a certified 
professional counselor to have an alcohol abuse screening.  The counselor's professional opinion was that Applicant has a "low probability for having an 
alcohol dependence disorder" and is not "an individual who has a significant alcohol abuse problem."  The Court was convinced of his sobriety and changed 
life that it set aside his 2002 DUI conviction in April 2003.  Lastly, Applicant has been alcohol free since December 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all available evidence, I do not find these incidents likely to reoccur and am convinced Applicant has made significant positive changes in behavior 
supportive of sobriety, MC E2.A8.1.3.3.  Accordingly, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
