<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On May 5, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry, </EM>dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Review Program, </EM>dated January
2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant in response to his application for a security clearance. The
SOR detailed why DOHA could not preliminarily determine under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue
Applicant's request for a security clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On May 24, 2005, Applicant responded to each of the SOR allegations and elected not to present his case at a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the
government's File of Relevant Materials (FORM) on June 15, 2005, which contained 13 itemized documents in support of the SOR. The complete FORM was
forwarded to Applicant and received by him on June 22, 2005. Applicant was given 30 days to file objections and to submit information in support of his
position. No further response was submitted by Applicant and the case was assigned to me on August 1, 2005.</P>

<P>Applicant holds a valid U.S. passport issued in January 2002.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> He previously held a passport issued by the government of the PRC in 1991 when he came to
the U.S.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> According to Applicant, his Chinese passport became invalid when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> He has taken no action since then to renew
his Chinese passport, and does not intend to do so.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Applicant holds no dual citizenship with any other country and does not have possession or use of any

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The People's Republic of China is the most populous country in the world and is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. The country has been undergoing
rapid and profound economic and social change and development.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> It also has a history of aggressive intelligence gathering endeavors directed at the United

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive,<EM> Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility For Access To Classified Information,</EM> sets forth the criteria which must be
evaluated when determining security clearance eligibility.<STRONG> </STRONG>The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that are considered in
denying or revoking an employee's request for access to classified<STRONG> </STRONG>information (Disqualifying Conditions), together with those factors that are considered in
granting an employee's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual circumstances of each case are
always different,<STRONG> </STRONG>the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and
unfavorable, to arrive at well- informed decisions. Section E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in
a case as the "whole person concept."<STRONG> </STRONG>In evaluating the conduct of the applicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should
consider pursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness
of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Protecting national security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance
must be clearly consistent with the interests of national security. Granting an applicant's clearance for access to classified information is predicated on a high
degree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must include consideration of not just the <EM>actual </EM>risk of disclosure
of such information, but also consideration of any <EM>possible </EM>risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information in any aspect
of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified
information.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily a determination of the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> It is merely
an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In accordance with the Directive, the government bears the burden of proof in the adjudicative process to first establish conditions which indicate it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> The legal standard for the burden of proof is
something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> When the government meets this burden, the corresponding heavy burden of rebuttal then falls on the
applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government, and to ultimately
demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Upon consideration of all the evidence submitted in this matter, the following adjudicative guideline is appropriate for evaluation with regard to the facts of this
case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Guideline B -</STRONG> <STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG>: <STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>I have thoroughly considered all the facts in evidence in this case and the legal standards required by the Directive. The government has established a <EM>prima
facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline B - Foreign Influence. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Considering all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>(An immediate family member, or a person to whom the
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country),</EM> and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2. <EM>(Sharing living quarters
with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists), </EM>apply in this case. "Immediate
family member" in the context of the first paragraph includes a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. In the context of the second
paragraph, Applicant resides with his wife whose parents are foreign citizens and could be subject to adverse foreign influence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant's parents and his wife's parents are citizens and residents of the PRC. All live in Shanghai and are now retired from various middle class
occupations. No information was presented concerning the frequency of Applicant's and his wife's contact with their parents, but it is reasonable to assume
there is regular communication among them. Applicant and his wife, and his brother and sister, have all been residing in the U.S. for about 15 years, but
returned to China about five years ago to attend a family wedding. Applicant has provided significant information concerning the current circumstances of his
parents and siblings, and given the family relationship, such contact  among the family members cannot be characterized as casual. Further, it is specifically
unknown whether or not Applicant's parents or his in-laws, along with his brother who is still a citizen of the PRC, are, or have ever been, members of the
Communist Party. Nevertheless, there is no rational basis to assume or conclude that the Chinese government can exert influence or pressure on or through its
citizens only if they are members of the Communist Party, or employed by, or associated with, a defense-related component of the government. The government
of the People's Republic of China maintains aggressive intelligence gathering techniques directed at the U.S. military and private U.S. corporations. While
having family ties with persons located in another country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying...[it] does raise a <EM>prima facie</EM> security concern
to require Applicant to present evidence of mitigation sufficient to meet applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> The government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of
disqualifying conditions under Guideline B.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>I have considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. <EM>(A determination that
the immediate family member(s) (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughter, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way</EM> <EM>that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the
United States), </EM>and find it does not apply in this case. Exploitation of Applicant's remaining immediate family members in the PRC is always possible. They
have been life-long residents and citizens of the PRC. Although Applicant's parents and his wife's parents are not agents of a foreign power and are elderly and
retired, the historically aggressive nature of the PRC in such matters demonstrates Applicant's parents and his in-laws could be potentially subject to pressure
and duress from the government. Even though it is unlikely, if not remote, that classified information could be compromised through these family members
given their station in life, FI MC E2.1.3.1. still does not apply.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In addition to the formal mitigating conditions, I have considered the following information with regard to the "whole person" concept in evaluating
Applicant's overall risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>First, Applicant left China with his wife in 1991 and emigrated to the U.S. Both became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2001, and they have not exercised any
rights and privileges of their previous PRC citizenship since becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant holds a valid U.S. passport and his prior passport
issued by the PRC government is no longer valid.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> Applicant's elderly parents are the only members of his immediate family who remain in China. With the
changes that have occurred in China since Applicant, his wife, and his siblings left the country, it is reasonable that they would want to stay in contact with their
parents, particularly since Applicant's siblings have also permanently emigrated to the U.S. No one in his family or his wife's family has ever been employed
by, or associated with, the government of the PRC. Thus, it is also unlikely that any of them have ever been members of the Communist Party. Applicant has
seen his parents and his in-laws twice since he left China nearly 15 years ago; the first time in 2000 when he attended his brother's wedding in Shanghai; and
the second time in 2004 during a work-related trip he took to China at the request of his present employer to attend a business convention. Neither his nor his
wife's parents have visited Applicant and his wife in the United States. His sister and brother have permanently located in the U.S. The information Applicant
has provided about his family appears credible considering all the circumstances.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Second, Applicant has been consistently employed since arriving in the U.S. and he and his wife are productive U.S. citizens. Applicant has been fully
responsible with regard to his personal financial affairs and he has never been charged with a criminal offense. Applicant and his wife hold no foreign passports
and do not hold dual citizenship with any other country. Applicant's sister has also been in the U.S. for at least 15 years, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen
in 2000. His brother is employed by a private U.S. company and has also been in the U.S. for about 15 years. He is currently a legal alien and it is reasonable to
conclude he may become a naturalized U.S. citizen as well.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Third, Applicant and his wife own no property and have no business connections or other financial interests in the PRC or any other foreign country, and
Applicant has never been employed by any foreign government, firm, or agency. He has not exercised the rights and privileges of any foreign citizenship since
becoming a naturalized U. S. citizen.<A HREF="04-02233.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Fourth, given their present circumstances, it is highly unlikely Applicant's parents or in-laws have any particular knowledge of Applicant's employment duties
and responsibilities in the U.S. While application of FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1. is not predicated upon a member of Applicant's immediate family having specific
knowledge of the nature of Applicant's work, their lack of knowledge logically reduces the likelihood the government might exploit them. Accordingly, the
opportunity for adverse influence against Applicant's relatives in the PRC is diminished. In addition, his closest family members are his wife, sister, and
brother, all of whom have ostensibly severed their prior connections with the PRC. All active members of the family now live permanently in the U.S. thereby
negating any vulnerability from pressure or duress that might be applied to any of them to gain access to classified information.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant has been an exemplary U.S. resident, and now citizen, for nearly 15 years. The government has not presented information to rebut the evidence
offered by Applicant. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence under the "whole person" concept that Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress
from the government of the PRC. His two trips to China were motivated to attend a family wedding and to attend a business convention related to his
employment, and were not a part of any questionable planned pattern of visits. His closest family members all permanently reside in the U.S. His only
remaining family in the PRC are his elderly parents and in-laws, and Applicant's credible information concerning their personal circumstances and employment
history mitigate against the likelihood that pressure would be asserted against them. I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated and overcome the
government's case under Guideline B.</P>
