<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On October 8, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 1, 1996, and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative
Judge on December 2, 1996.  On December 16, 1996, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant's
security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on seven
exhibits and her own testimony.  A transcript of the proceedings was received on December 31,
1996.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement
(Criterion H) set forth under subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g., all of the factual allegations
pertaining to personal conduct (Criterion E) set forth under subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c., and
all of the factual allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (Criterion J) under subparagraph 3.a.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 25 year old employee of a defense contractor.  She has worked for her
current employer since September 1995 and is applying for a secret clearance.  A favorable
preliminary determination could not be made in her case because of drug use and falsification. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant first smoked marijuana in 1985 when she was 14 years old.  After being
introduced to it by a friend, she used marijuana every two or three months until she was 17. 
When she was 17 in 1988, she began smoking marijuana daily after she began dating the man
whom she would later marry. After dating for a year, Appellant lived with him for another year
before marrying him in May 1990.  They were married until December 24, 1993, when Appellant
moved out and got her own apartment.  During the time that they were married, Appellant
worked regularly and earned the income on which they lived.  Although her husband seldom
worked, she allowed him to manage their money--which was the income she earned from her
job.  While they were married, they continued to smoke marijuana daily.  Appellant rationalizes
that she used marijuana as frequently as she did during that time period because she needed
something to calm her down; she would get very upset over the fact that her husband would be
sitting on the couch, "stoned," and "doing nothing" every night when she came home from work. 
He earned whatever money he did by selling marijuana and hashish.  While Applicant was
married, she had helped her husband process marijuana stems and leaves into hashish on a couple
of occasions, and had also helped him to sell marijuana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After leaving her husband in December 1993, Appellant continued to use marijuana daily
for at least another two years.  She used it during the time that she had her own apartment--from
December 1993 until she moved back in with her mother in June 1995.  And she continued to
smoke marijuana once a month even after moving back in with her mother in June 1995. 
Appellant stopped smoking  marijuana in October 1995 after completing the initial paperwork
for her security clearance.  She did not intend to use marijuana again, however, in the April-May
time frame of 1996, she smoked marijuana on three more occasions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	During the past five years, Appellant has had a series of medical problems which have
caused her to experience chronic and debilitating pain.  These medical problems have required
her to have surgery on three different occasions.2</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When Applicant completed her National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) on September 27,
1995, she certified that:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	....the entries made by me are true, complete and accurate to the best of my
knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing
and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment
or both.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In response to question 20.a. which asked if she had "ever tried or used or possessed any
narcotic...,  hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or
hashish)..." and question 20.b. which asked if she had "ever been involved in the illegal
purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,
hallucinogen, or cannabis?' Applicant answered "no." 	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	During her first interview with the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on May 28, 1996
(Govt. Exh. 4), Applicant admitted that she had started smoking marijuana in 1985 when she was
14.  She went on to state that she began smoking marijuana daily in 1989 after moving in with
the man whom she married a year later.  She admitted that she continued to smoke marijuana
daily while she was married, but stated that she had quit smoking in 1994 shortly after getting
divorced.  She denied that she had ever sold, grown, or manufactured drugs, and stated--in her
signed, sworn statement--that she did not intend to use drugs in the future.  During her second
interview with the DIS the following day (Govt. Exh. 3), Applicant admitted that she had
continued to smoke marijuana occasionally until October 1995.  And she admitted that she had
purchased some marijuana after her divorce.  During this interview, Applicant also admitted that
while she was married,  she had experimented with hashish and LSD, and may have sold
marijuana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant was interviewed by the DIS again on June 6, 1996.  During this interview, she
admitted that she had continued to smoke marijuana daily until June 1995 (Govt. Exh. 2).  From
June 1995 to October 1995, she estimates that she smoked marijuana weekly.  She intended to
quit smoking marijuana in October 1995--when she realized that she could not smoke marijuana
and keep her job--but she did not remain steadfast to her resolve.  Applicant admitted that she
smoked marijuana on three different occasions with three different people in late April, early
ay of 1996.  During the June 6 interview, Applicant also admitted that--while married-- she
had sold small quantities of marijuana when her husband was not home.  Finally, she admitted
that she had assisted her husband in his efforts to manufacture hashish, and may have assisted his
attempt to grow marijuana by watering a young plant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's supervisors and co-workers have submitted letters on her behalf.  While
indicating an awareness of her drug abuse history, all express their opinion that Appellant has put
her past behind  her and should be granted a security clearance.  She works hard; she is
motivated; and she consistently displays sound judgment.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSION</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria H, E, and J.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion H. Applicant has admitted that
she used marijuana daily from 1989 to June 1995, weekly from June to October 1995, and on three
separate occasions in late April, early May 1996.  In addition to using marijuana regularly over an
extended period of time, Applicant also admitted that she had purchased and sold marijuana, and that
she had assisted her ex-husband in his manufacture of hashish and in his attempt to grow marijuana. 
Further evidence of Applicant's drug involvement is found in her admission that she has
experimented with hashish and LSD.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In deciding whether Appellant's extensive marijuana abuse can be mitigated, I have given
favorable consideration to Applicant's age and to the personal circumstances under which she began
using marijuana regularly.  Partially as the result of a dysfunctional family environment, she became
involved with the wrong man when she was quite young.  She allowed him to make her decisions
during the three and one-half years they were married.  After she divorced, she continued to use
marijuana regularly because she was upset and depressed over the chronic pain she was experiencing
as the result of the medical problems which eventually required her to have surgery on three different
occasions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Mitigation for Applicant's drug involvement is found in her stated intention to abstain from
marijuana and other drugs in the future.  Unfortunately the credibility of her current resolve is
significantly diminished by her failure to remain steadfast to that resolve earlier during her initial
attempt to live drug free.  Her abuse of marijuana on three different occasions in April-May of 1996,
after she realized the consequences of continuing to use marijuana, causes this Administrative Judge
to have considerable doubt about her ability to remain true to her resolve and to continue to abstain
from marijuana and other drugs.  Because Applicant had used marijuana daily for more six years and
has already had one relapse, a longer period of abstinence is now necessary for her to demonstrate
that she has turned the corner and put that part of her life behind her.  Criterion H is concluded
against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire... or deliberately providing false and misleading information...to
an investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered
relevant and material when they are capable of influencing a federal's agency decision, e.g., a
decision to grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance Applicant's daily use of marijuana
from 1988 until June 1995 falls well within the definition of materiality.  Also falling within the
definition of materiality and also omitted from her NAQ--which she signed on September 27,
1995--are Applicant's experiments </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">with LSD and hashish,  her involvement in the manufacture of hashish, and her purchase and sale
of marijuana. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	And Appellant's omissions and falsifications did not end in September when she signed her
NAQ.  After her first interview  with the DIS on May 28, 1996, she signed a statement in which
swore that she had stopped smoking marijuana in 1994.  In the same statement, she swore that she
had never used any drugs other than marijuana, and that she had never  been involved in the sale or
manufacture of any drugs. And after an interview with the DIS only one day later, she swore that she
had used marijuana "rarely" after June 1995, and that she had quit smoking marijuana "completely"
(Govt. Exh. 3) in October 1995.  In both of these statements, Applicant lied when she failed to
disclose that she had used marijuana on three occasions within a month of the DIS interview.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	While Applicant finally  disclosed the full extent of her drug abuse and told of her
involvement in the manufacture and sale of drugs during her third interview with the DIS, her
belated truth telling does not mitigate her earlier falsifications.  Her disclosures came too late for her
to be credited with making a "prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification," and under
circumstances where she cannot be credited  with providing "correct information voluntarily."  Nor
is her falsification mitigated because it was an  isolated incident; Applicant had provided false or
misleading information on three occasions over a nine month period.  Criterion E is concluded
against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant's willfully withholding
information from the DoD on matters that are clearly relevant to her security clearance eligibility
violates 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential to influence the
course of the background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD.  Criterion J is
concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
