<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 29, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) 
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision based on the written record.   On March 31, 
2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed 
pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating 
Conditions 1<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 5.<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that his family members in Sudan are not agents of a foreign power and not in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in any way.  He also argues that his property interest in Sudan is minimal.  The Board does not find these arguments 
persuasive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge made unchallenged sustainable findings that Applicant's mother, two siblings, parents-in-law, and half-brother are citizens of Sudan, 
residing in Sudan, and that Applicant was co-owner of property in Sudan valued at approximately $100,000.  Given those findings, the Judge concluded that 
Applicant's ties with those immediate family members raised security concerns under Guideline B and that Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 8<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> applied.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">That 
conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  If there are admitted or proven facts and circumstances that raise security concerns, "[t]he applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department 
Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge has to weigh the evidence 
as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing 
of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had the burden of demonstrating that his family members in Sudan were not in positions where they are likely to be exploited by a foreign power.  
Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not 
met his burden of establishing that his relatives were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between 
loyalty to those relatives and the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The absence of evidence that Applicant's family members in Sudan are currently employees or agents of the Sudanese government is not dispositive.  Having 
relatives, cohabitants or associates who are connected with a foreign government is a disqualifying condition under Guideline B.<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  However, the absence of 
such a connection with a foreign government does not mean that there is no security concern under Guideline B.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-29665 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Nov. 10, 2004).  A reading of Guideline B in its entirety shows that security concerns can be raised by a variety of foreign connections, not just having 
family members with foreign government connections.  Additionally, the absence of a particular disqualifying condition does not compel a favorable security 
clearance decision.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-08052 at 3 (App. Bd. June 23, 2003).  In his decision, the Administrative Judge articulated a rational basis for 
his conclusion that Applicant's circumstances, including Sudan's political and human rights record, increased Applicant's vulnerability to foreign influence.  
Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of 
producing sufficient evidence to warrant the application of Mitigating Condition 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Whether an applicant's financial interest in a foreign country is "substantial" for purposes of applying Guideline B Disqualifying Condition 8, or "minimal" for 
purposes of applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition 5, does not turn simply on consideration of the dollar amount of that financial interest. The 
Administrative Judge is not required to engage in a piecemeal analysis of an applicant's financial ties separate from the other security concerns presented in the 
case.  In assessing the significance of the foreign financial interest involved, a Judge must not only consider its value in comparison to the applicant's financial 
interests in the United States, but also other record evidence concerning the facts and circumstances of the applicant's foreign financial interest and foreign 
family and other ties.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003).  Considering Applicant's foreign financial ties<A HREF="05-02741.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> in conjunction with 
his foreign family ties and the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his 
burden of producing sufficient evidence to warrant the application of Mitigating Condition 5.  Moreover, given the Judge's other findings, a favorable 
application of Mitigating Condition 5 by itself, would not necessarily overcome the security concerns, considering Applicant's foreign family ties.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record that was before him, the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 5 is sustainable, and his overall 
unfavorable clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
