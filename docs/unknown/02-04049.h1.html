granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
<P>On November 14, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under the personal security Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR recommended 
referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated December 4, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested a hearing.  This case was originally 
assigned to Administrative Judge Roger Willmeth on February 5, 2003.  It was reassigned to me on February 10, 2003 due to caseload considerations.  </P> 
<P>A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 12, 2003, setting the hearing for March 17, 2003.  On that date, I convened the hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented two exhibits<A HREF="02-04049.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"> which were admitted into 
evidence.  The Government also offered for administrative notice four documents<A HREF="02-04049.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">.  Applicant appeared and testified, presented two witnesses, and offered 
four exhibits<A HREF="02-04049.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">, all of which were admitted into evidence.  I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on March 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b., and 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d. of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact.  Applicant denied the allegation in subparagraph 2.c. of the SOR, but at the hearing the Government amended the SOR to reflect the evidence presented 
about the country in which Applicant's mother-in-law lived, and Applicant's answer was changed on the record to an admission to the amended subparagraph.  
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant was born on Taiwan, the Republic of China (TRC) in 1957.  Applicant graduated from college on TRC in 1980.  He is married and has two children, 
ages 15 and 12.  Applicant is employed in the computer field, and has worked for several companies in his career.  He first came to the United States in 1987 
when he worked for a large computer and technology company.  He lived in California for one and a half years, and then returned to the TRC.  He liked living 
in the United States and returned here in 1990.  He liked California and wanted a good life for his children.  He obtained a "green" (alien registration) card and 
became a citizen of the United States in May, 1998.  Applicant owns a home and is otherwise invested in the United States. (Tr. 28-36, 51-54, 63)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant had a TRC passport until he became a United States citizen, but kept physical possession of the TRC passport after he became a citizen.  He kept it in 
a closet at his home, but he said he did not need it anymore, because the U.S. passport is better.  His wife cut or tore off the cover of his passport and hers after 
they became U.S. citizens.  He finally turned in the passport in 2002.  He only used his U.S. passport to travel to TRC twice and to the Bahamas for vacation in 
2000.  Applicant renounced his TRC citizenship in 2003 to make certain there was no question that he was a U.S. citizen and turned in his TRC passport then.  
He said he would do whatever the United States needed him to do, including bearing arms against the TRC if called upon to do so. (Tr.35, 36, 38, 39-45, 49, 62, 
65, 96; Applicant Exhibits A and B at all pages)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant's spouse became a U.S. citizen in 1998.  She works in the financial management area for a company which has a government contract.  She kept her 
TRC passport after cutting off the cover in a house closet.  She formally renounced her TRC citizenship on January 28, 2003.  She surrendered her TRC 
passport when requested to do so by the TRC consular section as part of the renunciation process.  Applicant's spouse has traveled to the TRC in the past three 
years to visit her father.  Applicant's father-in-law is a citizen and resident of TRC, not the Peoples Republic of China on the mainland of China, as alleged in 
the SOR.  Her mother died in 1997.  She has two sisters and one brother who live in the TRC. (Tr.73, 74, 96-101, 112; Applicant Exhibit C and D at all pages)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant's parents are elderly and live in the TRC.  Applicant talks with them about every two weeks on the telephone.  He made his last visit to them in 1999, 
but does not send them money.  His father was a businessman who is now retired.  Applicant has one brother living in TRC.  Applicant does not own any 
property or have any bank accounts in the TRC.  Applicant stated he would not inherit anything from his parents. (Tr.45-47, 59, 68-70)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant's two children have TRC passports.  The children have not used the TRC passport since they got to the United States.  Applicant's spouse testified 
she never thought about the children's passports, so she just left them where they were, which was also in the home hall closet.  The children travel on her 
passport because they are minors and have not traveled on a TRC passport.  Applicant's spouse testified she would be willing to renounce her children's 
citizenship in the TRC if that action were necessary. (Tr.55-57, 96, 97, 105)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant has some difficulty expressing himself fully in English because it is a second language for him.  While Applicant may be an excellent computer 
software engineer, he is obviously not an expert on immigration law and practices to know when and how to renounce his TRC citizenship and how to dispose 
of his TRC passport.  Applicant's explanation of what he and his spouse did, and that he had to consult with his spouse on these procedures, is very credible 
and supports his contention that he did what he honestly thought was the correct thing to do about terminating his TRC citizenship and passport. (Tr. 28-88)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Enclosure 2).  
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE C: Foreign Preference</STRONG>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A3 .1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The exercise of dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B: Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.l. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,. daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s,) 
involved and the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.l.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Regarding Guideline C (foreign preference), the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 2 are applicable to this case.  Applicant possessed dual citizenship with 
TRC, and he had physical possession of a TRC passport.  However, the DC 1 requires "exercise" of dual citizenship, and the evidence establishes that 
Applicant never exercised any indicia of dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">It is clear from the evidence at the hearing that he and his wife vastly preferred living in the United States, primarily for the educational opportunities for their 
children.  They merely possessed the passports as a result of their immigration to the United States.  Applicant  willingly renounced the TRC citizenship with 
his wife when it became an issue, and complied with the U.S. requirements under the Directive and the TRC documentary requirements for renunciation.  The 
TRC passport was surrendered with the renunciation documents, and was not used after Applicant became a U.S. citizen.  As he testified, the TRC passport was 
not worth much because he could go anywhere in the world with a U.S. passport and almost nowhere with the TRC passport.  Therefore, Mitigating Conditions 
(MC) 1 and 4 clearly apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The foreign influence alleged under Guideline B is based on Applicant's family and his wife's family continuing to live in TRC, as they have all their lives (DC 
1).  Both sets of parents are elderly, and could not be expected to move from the country in which they lived all their lives.  Applicant and his wife have siblings 
living and working in TRC where they also have been living all their lives.  But all of them are in private business or working in the home.  The evidence is that 
none of them are employed by or are agents of the TRC, or in a position to be exploited by the TRC government to  coerce Applicant to choose between the 
United States and TRC in loyalty.  Applicant stated he would report any improper contacts to his security officer.  Therefore, MC 1 clearly applies.  Applicant 
does not have any financial interest in TRC which could cause concern, so MC 5 does apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the  whole person of Applicant, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant a clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Paragraph 1 Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Paragraph 2 Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 2.a: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 2.b.: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 2.c.: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Subparagraph 2.d.: For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">In light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
