<P>Title 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 bars Applicant from holding a clearance because she served more than one year in jail for violating terms of her probation in 1994.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On March 29, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline 
H (drugs), and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant timely submitted a responsive pleading, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2005, and I convened a hearing on November 16, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented five exhibits (GE 1 through 5). Applicant presented one exhibit (AE A) and the testimony of six witnesses, and testified in her own behalf. DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr) on December 1, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>SOR &para; 1.f alleged Applicant was precluded from holding a security clearance through application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. At the time the SOR was issued, this 
statute barred award or renewal of a clearance for anyone who had been convicted of a crime and sentenced to more than one year in jail. As alleged in SOR &para; 
1.d, available information indicated Applicant had been sentenced to four years in jail on conviction of a felony in 1989, but that the sentence was suspended 
conditioned on Applicant's adherence to the terms of her probation. The statute has since been amended and is now applicable only in cases where the applicant 
has actually served more than one year in jail. As alleged, the statute would not apply to SOR 1.d; however, information introduced at hearing showed 
Applicant violated her probation when she tested positive for cocaine. Based on the foregoing, and pursuant to Directive paragraph E3.1.17, Department 
Counsel moved to amend SOR &para; 1.d by adding the following language:</P> 
<P>"You subsequently violated your probation. As a result, you were ordered to be incarcerated and were incarcerated for 13 months."</P> 
<P>I concluded the information admitted into the record at that point supported such an allegation, and without objection by the Applicant, I granted Department 
Counsel's motion.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a materials handler on a contract at a U.S. Navy shipyard. She has held this job, albeit with 
different companies holding the same contract, since 1996. After graduating from high school, Applicant studied cosmetology and obtained a license to do 
business as a beautician and hair stylist. She was working as a beautician when she was introduced by a friend to cocaine in 1986. She quickly became addicted. 
Applicant used the drug daily, eventually smoking crack cocaine as well as snorting the drug in powdered form. Applicant was first treated for substance abuse 
that same year, when her mother took her to a rehabilitation center for a 30-day treatment program. Applicant did not finish this course of treatment. She used 
cocaine from 1986 until she went to jail in 1994. She suffered a brief relapse in 1995 or 1996, using about three or four times, but has been clean ever since.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on October 4, 1988, and charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a felony. She had been in an apartment with a drug 
dealer when police entered and searched the premises. A large quantity of drugs was found and she was charged along with the dealer. She eventually testified 
against the dealer as part of a plea bargain, through which she pleaded guilty to simple possession. In November 1989, after she had been in jail for 11 months, 
Applicant received a four year suspended jail sentence, was fined, placed on probation for four years, and ordered to undergo drug counseling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was arrested as discussed, above, she hid a small amount of cocaine in her underwear. After going to jail, the drugs were discovered on her 
person and she was charged with an additional count of drug possession. This charge was disposed of through the aforementioned plea deal.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was also arrested in December 1990, after being caught stealing a pair of gloves from a retail store. Because of her drug habit, she did not have 
money to buy Christmas gifts. Applicant was convicted of petit larceny, sentenced to 30 days in jail, of which all but two were suspended, and assessed a fine.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1992, Applicant was arrested after a traffic stop when an empty vial with cocaine residue was found in her car. She was charged and convicted of 
possession of cocaine, a felony, and sentenced to three years in jail. Her jail sentence was suspended, her driver's license was suspended, and she was placed on 
probation for five years. Applicant was also ordered to participate in drug treatment and to undergo random drug testing as part of her probation. In October 
1994, Applicant tested positive for cocaine. A court found she had violated her probation from the October 1988 arrest and her original jail sentence was 
reinstated. Applicant served 16 months in jail before being paroled in 1995. She successfully completed her parole and drug treatment in November 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on November 29, 2001. In response to question 21, which asked if she had ever been charged with 
or convicted of any felony offense, Applicant answered "no." In response to question 24, which asked of she had ever been charged with or convicted of any 
offense related to drugs or alcohol, she again answered "no." Applicant has asserted during her background investigation and in response to the SOR she 
misread the questions, understanding them to only require disclosure of events from the previous seven years. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2002, Applicant's company hired a new facility security officer (FSO), whose predecessor had been remiss in timely processing security clearance 
applications and related paperwork. As she investigated the status of various clearance applications, the FSO determined Applicant's SF 86 had not been 
submitted. She called Applicant into her office and went over a new form with her. In so doing, she explained to Applicant the correct interpretation of various 
questions therein, including questions 21 and 24. The FSO has experienced similar circumstances with other employees who have also misinterpreted the 
required scope of these questions. The FSO had Applicant fill out a new questionnaire, but was subsequently told DOHA had received her investigative file and 
the new questionnaire was not submitted.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's last known involvement with illegal drugs was not as a user, but occurred after her release from jail in 1995. After she witnessed the drug-related 
murder of a friend, Applicant assisted the state's attorney in securing a conviction primarily on the strength of her testimony.  She did so despite knowing she 
would be subject to vigorous cross-examination because of her arrest record and history of drug use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's testimony at the hearing was credible and sincere. Her mother testified she was a good student in high school and never got into trouble before she 
became addicted to drugs. Her sister testified Applicant was her role model when they were growing up. Applicant was an athlete and, by all accounts, a 
responsible girl growing up. She has five children and, by all accounts is a responsible, caring mother who works hard to provide her children with a good life 
and to set a good example. Applicant's employer and co-workers speak highly of her job performance and regard her as trustworthy. Applicant's former 
probation officer testified she has no knowledge of any trouble Applicant has been in since 1995. She also testified that Applicant was cooperative during her 
parole and, based on her experience with Applicant, not likely to repeat her earlier transgressions.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for consideration in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E (personal 
conduct), Guideline H (drugs), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the applicant 
bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust 
and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern may arise if it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questioned Applicant's trustworthiness by alleging she deliberately omitted from her SF 86 the fact she had been charged 
four times with drug-related felonies as required by SF 86 question 21 (SOR &para; 3.a), and that she deliberately failed to list those same drug-related charges as 
required by SF 24 (SOR &para; 3.b). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted sufficient information to show that these omissions and inaccuracies exist. Based on available information, Guideline E DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
must be considered. To be disqualifying, the omissions and inaccuracies must have been made with intent to mislead or deceive the government in its 
investigation of Applicant's background. Applicant asserts in her defense that she misunderstood the scope of the questions in the SF 86 to be limited to the 
preceding seven years and that she miscalculated what events would have been included in that period. However, the questions at issue are not, by their plain 
language, limited in scope. Rather, they seek information about any such charge at any time. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Generally, Applicant's response would be untenable. There is nothing complicated about the questions at issue here and Applicant is an intelligent individual 
fully capable of reading and understanding the questions. However, the record here also contains credible testimony by Applicant's FSO, who went over the 
questions with Applicant as part of the FSO's efforts to update the security applications from Applicant's company. It was apparent to the FSO a mistake had 
been made because of Applicant's misunderstanding of the questions. Combined with Applicant's credible presentation of what happened, I conclude she 
lacked the intent required for disqualification. In light of all of the information probative of this issue, DC 2 does not apply, and I conclude Guideline E for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also cross-alleged as a separate security concern under Guideline H (illegal drugs) Applicant's arrests for drug-related offenses (SOR &para; 2.a). 
Illegal drug use or involvement with illegal drugs through purchase, sale, or possession is a security concern because it raises questions about an individual's 
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The government presented sufficient evidence to support these allegations. Accordingly, Guideline H DC 
1<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> By her own admission, Applicant used and / or possessed cocaine on a daily basis for nearly ten years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available information also supports application of Guideline H mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has not used or been involved with illegal 
drugs for more than ten years. She has a stable, productive life, and has the support of her family, friends and co-workers. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the information 
available about Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs, I conclude Guideline H for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the government has declined to award Applicant a clearance because of the criminal offenses that were the product of her drug addiction. Specifically, 
the government alleged Applicant was charged with and convicted of felony drug possession, twice in October 1988 (SOR &para;&para; 1.d and 1.e), and in October 1992 
(SOR &para; 1.b). The government also alleged she was jailed in October 1994 for violating her state's drug control act (SOR &para; 1.a), and that she was convicted of 
petit larceny for shoplifting in December 1990 (SOR &para; 1.c). The allegation in SOR &para; 1.d was amended to also allege Applicant spent 13 months in jail for 
violating her probation from her October 1988 conviction. Criminal conduct is a security concern because a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk 
fines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government submitted 
sufficient information to support these allegations, and Applicant has admitted these facts throughout her investigation and at her hearing. Based on the 
available information about Applicant's criminal conduct, Guideline J DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's last criminal offense occurred over 11 years ago. Since then, she has successfully overcome her drug addiction, which was the root 
cause of her criminal conduct between 1988 and 1994. Available information, including substantial testimony about Applicant's reliability, good character, and 
integrity, supports Application of Guideline J MC 1,<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> MC 4,<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 6.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant is a devoted mother and, since 1996, a reliable employee of several 
companies doing business with the Department of Defense. On balance, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about her criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Absent application of the Smith Amendment, I would conclude Guideline J for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> However, because Applicant served more than one year in jail for 
violating her probation in1994, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (also known as the Smith Amendment) applies to bar Applicant from receiving a clearance. The Defense 
Department and the military departments may not grant or renew a clearance for any DoD officer or employee, any employee, officer, or director of a DoD 
contractor, or a member of the armed forces, both active and inactive, whose circumstances fall within one of four statutory categories.<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The specific category 
at issue here is 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1), which, when first enacted, barred grant or renewal of a clearance where a person has been convicted of a crime and 
sentenced to "imprisonment for a term exceeding one year." In October 2004, Congress amended the statute in relevant part to impose this prohibition in cases 
where the person was sentenced "to imprisonment  for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year." 
Therefore, under either the original or amended versions of the Smith Amendment, Applicant's criminal record bars her from holding a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Smith Amendment also provides that the appropriate authority may authorize a waiver, in meritorious cases, of the statutory prohibitions in 10 U.S.C. &sect; 
986(c)(1) and (4). DOHA Operating Instruction (OI) 64, dated July 10, 2001, further requires administrative judges to state whether or not they recommend 
further consideration of Smith Amendment cases for possible waiver of the statutory bar, but only in cases where the Smith Amendment is the sole basis for 
denial or revocation. As noted above, I have concluded Applicant has mitigated the Guideline E, Guideline H, and Guideline J security concerns expressed in 
the SOR. Accordingly, absent application of the Smith Amendment, I would find it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's request 
for a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative 
guidelines. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-19537.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> of the available information about Applicant's criminal record, drug use, and answers to the questions in her 
SF 86, taken in the context of all of the information before me, shows she has overcome any reasonable doubts about her judgment and reliability. Her criminal 
conduct is dated and not likely to recur, due in large part to the fact she has not used illegal drugs in more than ten years. Further, her omission of information 
about her criminal conduct from her SF 86 was not a deliberate attempt to deceive the government. Accordingly, but for the requirements of the Smith 
Amendment, Applicant has overcome the government's case for disqualification.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
