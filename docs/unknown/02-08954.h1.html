<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by a 24-year-old Afghanistan-born naturalized American Applicant with permanent resident, non-U.S. citizen, mother and sister 
(citizens of Afghanistan), and three non-resident, non-U.S. citizen, sisters (citizens of Afghanistan and residents of India), as well as naturalized American 
father, sister, and uncle, none of whom are agents of Afghanistan or India or in a position to be exploited by those governments, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">have been mitigated by the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated March 19, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to another Administrative Judge on April 14, 2003, but, due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge 
on May 8, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2003, and the hearing was held before me on May 28, 2003.  During the course of the hearing, four 
Government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of four Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was 
received on June 6, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the commencement of the hearing, the Department Counsel moved to amend subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR by deleting the word "residents" and substituting 
therefore the word "citizens."  There being no objection interposed by Applicant, the motion was granted.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been revealed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is at least a third generation Afghanistan-born ethnic Indian.  He was born in 1979 in Afghanistan,<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> but when he was one-year-old, and fighting 
erupted when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, he moved with his family to India.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In April 1994, when he was about 15-years-old, he, his parents, and 
one sister, immigrated to the United States under the sponsorship of his uncle-a U.S. citizen.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  His father and sister both eventually became naturalized citizens 
of the U.S.,<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> but because of difficulties learning the English language, his mother found it too difficult to apply for her U.S. citizenship.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Instead, she remains 
a citizen of Afghanistan and a legal resident of the U.S.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  A second sister also emigrated to the U.S. and she too is a citizen of Afghanistan and a legal resident 
of the U.S.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three other older sisters are citizens of Afghanistan residing in India with their respective Indian husbands and school-aged children.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The sisters are 
housewives.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His brothers-in-law are employed in private business, and are not associated with any government or military agencies.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant's contacts 
with his overseas sisters is infrequent, and he tries to speak with them on the telephone, all at the same time, about two times per year.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant graduated from high school in the U.S., and in 2000, received a bachelors degree from a U.S. university.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither Applicant nor his parents have any foreign investments or financial interests in either India or Afghanistan.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  While he supports his parents, he does 
not send any money to his sisters in India.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant maintains no personal, financial, or religious ties in Afghanistan.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  His focus is entirely in the United 
States where he now owns a home, has bank accounts, employment, and a retirement plan.<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  He considers the U.S. his home and does not want to reside in 
any other country. Applicant has been employed by his current employer-a government contractor-as a software engineer since July 2000.  Applicant's friends, 
college roommates, and co-workers all speak very favorably in support of his application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there are remnants of the former Taliban regime and the terrorist Al-Qaida network in Afghanistan, and there are continuing threats of terrorist 
actions, Afghanistan has a strong military presence of U.S. forces assisting the new interim government.  Afghanistan is no longer a nation whose interests are 
inimical to the United States, but it cannot yet be considered a friendly "democracy" following a lengthy period in which it was under Taliban authoritarian rule.  
Nevertheless, it is not known to conduct intelligence operations or economic espionage against the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the government has offered no evidence pertaining to India, while that nation is generally considered to be a democracy, it apparently does engage in 
economic intelligence gathering in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE]:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government 
must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this 
Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because 
members of his immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, his mother and one sister are citizens 
of Afghanistan but residents of the U.S.; and three sisters are citizens of Afghanistan but residents of India--are either not citizens or residents of the United 
States or may be subject to duress.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, 
as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-08954.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The citizenship status of four of Applicant's sisters (the three residing in India and the one residing in the U.S.), as well as the citizenship status of his mother, 
when considered in light of the nature of the government in Afghanistan--a friendly nascent democracy that is no longer hostile to the United States, and whose 
interests are no longer inimical to the United States, with a strong military presence of U.S. forces--facilitates an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines 
and the various applicable conditions set forth therein.  Furthermore, that analysis is simplified by the fact that none of Applicant's relatives remain in 
Afghanistan, but rather had relocated either to the U.S. or India.  Applicant's father, sister, and uncle are already naturalized U.S. citizens, and only the 
continuing Afghanistan citizenship of his mother and four other sisters raise the issue of potential foreign influence.  In this regard, see Foreign Influence 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) and DC E2.A2.1.2.2. (<EM>sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship 
status, if the potential for adverse influence or duress exists</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), 
(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  In this 
instance, after an examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's mother and four sisters, considering their citizenship and residency status, do not 
constitute an unacceptable security risk.  Furthermore, their continuing personal relationship is viewed in positive terms, having no security significance.  Thus, 
I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect to 
Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
