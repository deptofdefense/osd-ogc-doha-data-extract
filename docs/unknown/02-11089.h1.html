<P>Applicant is a 24-year-old native-born citizen of the United States.  She has worked for defense contractor since 2000 and successfully held an interim 
clearance.  Applicant's grandmother and aunt are citizens and residents of Vietnam.  Applicant's mother stays in contact with them, but Applicant does not.  
Applicant's two sisters are still citizens of Vietnam, although they live in the U.S. and intend to apply for citizenship.  All the remaining members of 
Applicant's immediate family are citizens and residents of the U.S., including her husband and daughter.  Applicant's limited ties to her relatives in Vietnam 
and her extensive bonds with the U.S. mitigate the security concerns arising from possible foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 24, 2000, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue 
a security clearance for Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On February 25, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  
The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 9, 2004.  She originally opted to have the matter decided without a hearing.  Later, Applicant elected to have 
a hearing before an administrative judge. </P> 
<P>The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge, but was re-assigned to me on August 25, 2004.  I initially set the hearing for September 15, 
2004, but delayed it due to a scheduling conflict.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on November 16, 2004.  At the hearing, 
Government counsel moved to amend the allegations in &para; 1.b and &para; 1.c, without objection, and I granted the motion.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The government presented four exhibits.  
Applicant presented four exhibits and the testimony of one witness.  Applicant also testified on her own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
December 6, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegations in &para; 1.b of the SOR.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  She admitted the factual allegations in &para;&para; 1.a and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Those admissions

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<EM>.</EM>"  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 defines "immediate family 
members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant has two sisters who are citizens of Vietnam, even though they 
reside in the United States.  This "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.2 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where an applicant is, "[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their 
citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  Applicant resides with her mother, whose mother and sister are citizens and 
residents of Vietnam.  As noted above, Applicant also lives with a sister who is a citizen of Vietnam.  I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, these potentially disqualifying conditions can be mitigated under certain conditions.  It is potentially mitigating where "the immediate 
family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of Applicant's relatives are members of the military forces or the government of Vietnam.  There is no evidence indicating any one of them is an "agent 
of a foreign power."<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether an applicant is vulnerable to exploitation through relatives in a foreign country, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the 
character of the government of the relevant foreign country.  Vietnam is a communist country.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  Foreign visitors to Vietnam have been arbitrarily arrested, 
detained, or expelled.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  U.S. citizens who were formerly citizens of Vietnam may be subject to governmental control; they are treated as Vietnamese citizen in 
criminal matters and subjected to military service and taxes.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  There has been some terrorist activity in Indonesia (although not targeted at Americans) and the 
State Department is concerned that similar attacks could spread to Vietnam.<A HREF="02-11089.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A>  Under the circumstances, the possibility exists that a foreign power in Vietnam 
would attempt to exploit or pressure its residents to act adversely to the interests of the United States.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in Vietnam.<STRONG>   </STRONG>Applicant's grandmother is retired and is ill.  Her aunt is self-employed.  There is no evidence either has the means or the power to leave the country at will.  Under these circumstances, there is some opportunity for 
adverse influence against Applicant's relatives in Vietnam.<EM>  </EM>However, with regard to Applicant's relatives who are citizens of Vietnam living permanently in 
the United States, their vulnerability to pressure or duress from a foreign power in Vietnam is very slight.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through her ties with her relatives.  Obviously, Applicant is close 
to her mother and sister.  Applicant does not maintain regular contact with her grandmother or aunt in Vietnam.  Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth, and has 
lived in this country all her life.  All her immediate family members, including her husband and daughter, live in the U.S. and most are citizens.  All her assets 
are in this country; she owns no property in Vietnam.  She has worked for a defense contractor for several years and was previously granted access to 
confidential material without adverse incident. <STRONG> </STRONG>Considering Applicant's limited connection to her relatives in Vietnam and her powerful ties to the United 
States, I find Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power in Vietnam.  I conclude the mitigating condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of 
the Directive applies.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 of the Directive, it may also be mitigating where "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  
Applicant does not stay in contact with her grandmother or her aunt in Vietnam, therefore this mitigating condition applies to the security concerns arising from 
that relationship.  At the same time, Applicant has regular contact with her mother and a sister who is a citizen of Vietnam.  This potentially mitigating 
condition does not apply to those relationships.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential 
security concerns arising from Applicant's family ties to Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
