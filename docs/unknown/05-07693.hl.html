<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a federal contractor.  His outstanding indebtedness has remained for up to four to six years.  He and his wife had a small business failure, his wife lost her job 
due to medical reasons, and a family member was killed, and they made a decision to move to help the widow and two children.  He is not making progress on resolving this old indebtedness.  He did 
not deliberately falsify answers on a security clearance application.  He successfully mitigated security concerns involving financial considerations and personal conduct under the whole person

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 
1960), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 14, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision - security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 28, 2006, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 
September 6, 2006.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on October 2, 2006.  I convened a hearing on November 2, 2006, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The government offered six exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-6.  Applicant offered four exhibits, marked as exhibits A-D.  I kept the record open until 
November 17, 2006, to allow Applicant time to file additional documents.  On November 16, 2006, Department Counsel received Applicant's undated letter, with a list of creditors with current debt 
amounts, and monthly payment amounts, undated and unsigned.  I marked this as Applicant's Exhibit E.  The government filed a memorandum on November 17, 2006, making no objection to its 
admission.  Applicant's Exhibit E is admitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2006.</P>

<P>Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g., and denied the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.  The admissions are incorporated herein as  findings 
of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a federal contractor.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He is married and has no children.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He served four and one-half years in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), receiving an honorable 
discharge as an E-4 in January 1998.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He has 80 hours toward a degree in radiology.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  This is his first application for a security clearance.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As of October 12, 2005, Applicant owed the following debts:</P> 
 
<P>1.a. $423 for a delinquent account referred for collection in October 2002;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>1.b. $2,842 for a delinquent account referred for collection in March 2002;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>1.c. $1,298 for a delinquent account referred for collection in July 2000;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>1.d. $1,377 for a delinquent account charged off as a bad debt in September 2001;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>1.e. $4,342 for a delinquent account referred for collection in September 2001;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>1.f. $3,931for a delinquent account referred for collection in February 2002;<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and</P> 
 
<P>1.g. $1,045 for a delinquent account charged off as a bad debt in June 2002.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant testified that the outstanding balances remain the same.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He began using the services of a credit counseling service, which put him on a payment plan of $625 a month.  He 
could not afford that amount, so no payments were ever made.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In 1999, Applicant and his wife started a small business, operated out of a kiosk in a mall.  They used credit cards to start the business, and one year later, they closed the business due to poor sales.  
They lost about $5,000 to $7,000.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  About the same time, Applicant's wife lost her job due to medical reasons.  She subsequently started an eBay business using the Internet.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The following year, 
his brother-in-law was killed in a work-related accident, leaving his wife and two children, ages 4 and 13.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife moved back to the town where his wife's sister lived, so they 
could help her with the two boys.  They moved into his father-in-law's house, which was dilapidated.  They borrowed to make repairs using his mother-in-law's credit cards, because she had better 
credit standing.  Because he is making payments on those debts, he has been unable to address his own debts.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  His car blew its engine so his sister-in-law bought him and his wife a new car for 
$22,000, for which they pay her $200 per month.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant submitted a statement listing his creditors, the current total debt ($62,560.15), and the monthly payments ($1,187.00).<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application, dated March 14, 2004. </P> 
 
<P>In response to the following, <STRONG>Question 38.  Your financial delinquencies - 180 days</STRONG>  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered "credit cards" in two 
columns, and put what appears to be the total for those cards.  He did not itemize that he had five delinquent accounts: 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.g., above.</P> 
 
<P>In response to the following, <STRONG>Question 39.  Your financial delinquencies - 90 days </STRONG> Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered "No" knowing that he had seven 
delinquent accounts: 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g., above.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not list any debts in responding to question 39 as he believed they would be covered under question 38.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He listed the general category of credit cards on question 38, and listed totals 
that were about 80% of the amounts he owed.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€€€ë€é€ë€ê€"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €é>">The government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>.)  
Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on several accounts for four to six years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €é>">Various conditions can mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. The Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The 
conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation</EM>).  Applicant's and his wife's mall kiosk business failed.  His wife lost her job for medical reasons.  Their brother-in-law died, and they decided to move to his sister-in-law's town to help 
care for the two children.  These are unforeseen events and the mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €é>">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.  
While there is evidence of seeking financial counseling, the monthly payment amount was too high so no payments were ever made.  While there is evidence that Applicant is paying the debts on his 
mother-in-law's credit cards, he is paying only interest on most other debts.  While the record does not contain all of Applicant's financial statistics, it appears that his debts might exceed his ability to 
pay off those debts within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad debts) </EM>is questionable.  Notwithstanding his past history, Applicant has made 
some effort at payment and has not incurred any additional debt except for contingencies (i.e., new car because his old one blew the engine).  He is slowly but deliberately resolving his indebtedness.  
I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €">The government did not establish its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) is the standard.  The operative word is "deliberate."  Applicant listed his debts generically by 
listing "credit cards" then putting a combined total.  He made an effort to answer the question and it is not indicative of an attempt to avoid answering the questions.  His belief that a 90-day 
delinquency would be covered by a 180-day delinquent debt is reasonable.  I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €ë€é€ë€ê€">  "Available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><EM>  </EM>In evaluating Applicant's case, in addition to the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, I also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.<A HREF="05-07693.hl.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  I considered his age (32), his education, his 
employment, and what might be causative of his financial circumstances.  Applicant has had a run of bad luck.  While the wisdom of his financial decisions can be questioned, his decisions were made 
in good faith based upon what he and his wife felt was appropriate under the circumstances.  And events were certainly beyond his control.  What is problematic is the fact that it appears his 
obligations exceed his ability to pay.  I do not have persistent doubts about his ability to protect classified information and to conduct himself with discretion in carrying out duties for which a security 
clearance is required.  He learned this in the Marine Corps.  It is for these reasons, using the whole person concept, that I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant's security clearance.</SPAN></P>
