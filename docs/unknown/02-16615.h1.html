<P>A 44-year-old Applicant, employed by a defense contractor as a financial manager, mitigated her failure to file Federal and state income tax returns for three 
years.  She filed all the delinquent returns specified in the Statement of Reasons, as well as those for an additional year for which she had not filed, and did not 
owe taxes on any of them.  She further demonstrated her professed rehabilitation by filing early returns for the most current tax year.  To the extent that 
delinquent debts were not rebutted or shown to have been previously paid, Applicant mitigated them by paying them off and demonstrating that her finances are 
in order.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 26, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>,<EM> </EM>dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR states that DOHA was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to any classified information and recommends that her case be submitted 
to an Administrative Judge.  On September 13, 2002, Applicant executed a response to the SOR and requested a hearing.  This case was assigned to the 
undersigned Administrative Judge on January 8, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 5, 2003, and the hearing was held on March 21, 2003.  During 
the hearing, six Government (Govt) exhibits, eleven Applicant (Ap) exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on 
arch 31, 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing in this case, Applicant provided documentary proof of payment of all delinquent debts except for the water bill specified in  SOR &para; 2.d.  Since it 
appeared that Applicant had such evidence in her possession, I permitted her one week to submit it through Department Counsel.  <A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>Applicant submitted the 
same on March 25, 2003 and Department Counsel forwarded it to me on March 26, 2003.  Department Counsel agreed that it supports Applicant's claim that 
she satisfied the debt but she reasserted the Government's concerns with Applicant under Guideline F.  I have marked Applicant's submission, including 
Department Counsel's response, as Ap Ex L and have considered it in rendering this decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old financial manager employed by a defense contractor and is seeking a security clearance.  Her financial problems began when her 
husband left her and her three-year-old daughter in 1985.  He closed out their credit and bank accounts and gave notice on their apartment.  Applicant was a 
student and had no job.  She was able to obtain rooms with another woman and obtained a part-time internship.  Applicant received spousal support for 18 
months, at which point she began receiving child support of $300.00 per month.  At this time she was "living off credit cards."<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In 1996, Applicant was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and began treatment with a chiropractor.  This exacerbated her financial problems because the 
chiropractor was not covered under her medical insurance.  Applicant elected to pay her chiropractic bills instead of other bills.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Her indebtedness at this time 
was approximately $10,000.00.  Applicant borrowed funds from her 401K account to pay off debt.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In April 1997, Applicant became a family caretaker of her nephews, ages two and four, when they became wards of the state.  She cared for them for 14 months 
and received support from the state for their care, which was not quite sufficient to cover her added expenses.  However, the oldest boy had asthma and 
Applicant had to take a lot of time off from work without pay to get him to medical appointments, counseling appointments, and supervised visitations.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In 1998, Applicant again borrowed funds from her 401K account to pay off debts.  In 1999, another older nephew moved in with her and stayed for a year.  
Applicant's employer transferred her from the west coast to the east coast in 2000 and she had added expenses due to the move.  In 2002, she incurred the cost 
of returning to the west coast on two occasions, when her grandfather died and later when her best friend died.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant is providing support to her daughter, 
who is attending college.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant failed to file her Federal income tax returns for tax years 1998 (SOR &para; 1.a), 1999 (SOR &para; 1.c), and 2000 (SOR &para; 1.e) by the required filing dates.  She 
also failed to file her state income tax returns for 1998 (SOR &para; 1.b) and 1999 (SOR &para; 1.d), as well as both her west coast state income tax return (SOR &para; 1.f) and 
her east coast state income tax return (SOR &para; 1.g) for tax year 2000, by the required filing dates. Applicant filed all seven of these tax returns on September 12, 
2002.  On her Federal returns, she received refunds of $878.60 for 1999 and $2481.52 for 2000.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant forfeited a Federal refund of $2669.70 for tax year 
1998 by filing more than three years after the due date.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  On her state returns, she received refunds of $1263.86 for 1998, $198.50 for 1999, and $366.24 on her 
west coast state return for 2000<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  On her east coast state return for 2000, Applicant received a refund of $264.54.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant filed her Federal income tax return and her state income tax return for tax year 2001, but not by the required due date.  She received refunds of 
$3165.00 on her Federal return and $412.62 on her state return.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Applicant filed both her Federal income tax return and her state income tax return for tax

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Section E2.2.2 of the Directive requires that "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national interest will be resolved 
in favor of national security." The burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to present evidence, in accordance with the Directive, that it 
is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  </SPAN>Directive E3.1.14.  Once t<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he Government 
meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to present evidence to refute or mitigate the Government's evidence and to ultimately demonstrate it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.  </SPAN>Directive E3.1.15<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying , as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>The concern under Guideline J is a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (Disqualifying Condition 1).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (Mitigating Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations:  the concern is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.  </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>A history of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying Condition 1);</P> 
 
<P>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) (Mitigating Condition 3);</P> 
 
<P>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (Mitigating Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Guideline J</P> 
 
<P>The evidence of record establishes that Applicant failed to file both her Federal and state income tax returns for three consecutive years.  Even though she has 
not been charged for these criminal misdemeanors, this constitutes criminal conduct (Disqualifying Condition 1).  The Federal statute and the east coast state 
statute require that the failure to file be willful.  This requires that the failure to file a return be done purposefully, as distinguished from inadvertently, 
negligently, or mistakenly. <EM>U.S. v. Matosky, </EM>421 F.2d 410 (7<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1970), certiorari denied 398 U.S. 904.  Applicant acknowledged to the DSS special agent that 
she "worked the tax forms" but did not file due to "laziness."<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  This admission is sufficient to demonstrate that Applicant acted willfully in not filing the tax 
returns.</P> 
 
<P>After receiving the SOR, Applicant filed all seven of the income tax returns specified in the SOR (SOR &para; 2.a through SOR &para; 2.g).  She also filed the income tax 
returns she owed for 2001. Applicant did not owe any tax on any of these returns but received refunds for all of them, with the exception of her Federal return 
for 1998, for which she forfeited a refund by filing more than three years after the due date.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant testified that the process in this case had showed her the gravity of not filing her tax returns (even if no tax is owed) and that she would file both 
before the deadline in the future.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Moreover, she has manifested that intent, to the extent she can at this point, by having filed both her Federal and state tax 
returns for 2002 prior to the due date.  Applicant also paid off all of the other debts specified in the SOR that were still outstanding.</P> 
 
<P>I believe that it has become abundantly clear to Applicant that any failure on her part to properly file her tax returns in the future or pay her debts will make her 
ineligible for a security clearance.  Given Applicant's demeanor at the hearing, the decisive actions she has taken to properly resolve all of the allegations in the 
SOR, as well as additional obligations not specified in the SOR, and her actions in filing the latest income tax returns before the date they were due, I conclude 
that there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation on the part of Applicant (Mitigating Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F</P> 
 
<P>The evidence in the record establishes both a history of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying Condition 1), as well as an inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts on the part of Applicant (Disqualifying Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has successfully rebutted the Government's evidence that she has state tax liability for tax year 1999 (SOR &para; 2.g).  Evidence in the record establishes 
that she filed the return and received a refund of $198.50.<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Although Applicant did incur the bad debt, Applicant provided correspondence from the creditor's 
collection agency that she paid off the largest of the remaining delinquent debts specified in the SOR in 1998, more than four years before the SOR was issued 
(SOR &para; 2.b).<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  I find that evidence more compelling than the 2001 credit report on Applicant, which still listed the debt.  Moreover, the pay off is confirmed 
by the 2003 credit report on Applicant, which no longer reflects the debt.</P> 
 
<P>The evidence of record demonstrates that Applicant financial problems, both initially and at later times, resulted from conditions that were largely beyond her 
control (Mitigating Condition 3). When her husband left her in 1985, she was not employed and had no means of supporting both herself and her three-year-old 
child.  In 1996, her need for chiropractic care caused her to pay for that  treatment at the expense of other bills.  Taking on the care of two young nephews for 
over a year, beginning in 1997, and the care of an older nephew for nearly a year, beginning in 1999, also contributed to Applicant's financial challenges.  
Finally, her need to return to the west coast on two occasions in 2002, as a result of the death of her grandfather and later the death of her best friend, also 
affected Applicant's ability to resolve her finances.</P> 
 
<P>The most compelling evidence of record on behalf of Applicant is that she has paid off all of the remaining delinquent debts specified in the SOR (SOR &para; 2.a, 
SOR &para; 2.c through SOR &para; 2.f, and SOR &para; 2.h).<A HREF="02-16615.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  In addition, her credit history for recent years reflects substantial improvement in her management of her 
finances.  Based on her current income, the assets she has accumulated, as well as her professed reform in filing her taxes and paying her bills, Applicant is not 
currently experiencing financial difficulties and should avoid them in the future.  Having heard her testimony and assessed her credibility, I conclude that 
applicant has paid off all remaining delinquent debts in a good faith effort to resolve them and is committed to avoiding such delinquencies in the future, 
thereby satisfying the requirements of Mitigating Condition 6.</P>
