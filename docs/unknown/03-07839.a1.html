  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence.  The presence of conflicting record evidence does not diminish the Judge's responsibility as the trier of fact.  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, assess the credibility of the  testimony of Applicant and the investigator who interviewed Applicant, and make a finding as to Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the  security clearance application.  It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant had not presented evidence sufficient to mitigate his  falsification of the security clearance application.  The Judge properly concluded Applicant's falsification was a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  Applicant has not  demonstrated the Judge was compelled as a matter of law or logic to conclude Applicant's conduct was mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating  Conditions 1, 2 and 6.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">William F. Savarino, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 14, 2003, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline 
E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated December 9, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application; (2) 
in the alternative, whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application was not mitigated; and (3) 
whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's past criminal conduct was not mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant 
falsified a security clearance application in December 2000 by not disclosing that he had been charged in December 1992 with grand larceny and burglary, both 
of which were felony charges.<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge's finding of falsification.  In support of that challenge, Applicant argues: (a) the 
Judge failed to properly consider Applicant's state of mind when he completed the security clearance application;  (b) the Judge's finding of falsification does 
not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record  evidence as a whole; and (c) the Judge's finding of falsification is based on invalid premises and erroneous 
reasoning.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  That presumption is not rebutted or overcome by Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's assessment of the 
credibility of Applicant's hearing testimony, or the Judge's choice to weigh the record evidence differently from how Applicant would have liked the Judge to 
weigh it.</P> 
 
<P>There is conflicting record evidence concerning Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the security clearance application.  However, the 
presence of conflicting record evidence does not diminish the Administrative Judge's responsibility as the trier of fact.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-09892 (July 
15, 2004) at p. 5 (Board noting that it is not unusual for a Judge to be faced with the need to consider and weigh conflicting record evidence, and then make 
findings of fact).  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, assess the credibility of the testimony of Applicant and the investigator who 
interviewed Applicant, and make a finding as to Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the security clearance application.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 02-15935 (October 15, 2003) at p. 6 (discussing need for Judge to consider record evidence as a whole to make a finding of fact about an applicant's intent 
or state of mind in a falsification case).  Giving due deference to the Judge's credibility determinations,<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> the Board concludes that the Judge's finding of 
falsification reflects a plausible, legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's strong disagreement with the Judge's finding 
of falsification is not sufficient to persuade the Board that the finding is not sustainable in light of the record evidence in this case.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">In the alternative, whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application was not mitigated</SPAN>.  
Applicant contends, in the alternative, that if the Administrative Judge's finding of falsification is sustainable, the Judge should have concluded that Applicant's 
falsification was mitigated.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) the Judge should have concluded his falsification was mitigated under Personal 
Conduct Mitigating Condition 2; (b) the Judge erred by concluding Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3 does not apply; and (c) the Judge erred by 
concluding that Applicant's reference to his 2002 reckless driving citation as merely speeding was evidence of his propensity for untruthfulness.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that Applicant's theory about the significance of his disclosures to the investigator who interviewed him does not warrant 
application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2,<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> but rather raises the question of whether the Administrative Judge should have applied Personal 
Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-06166 (October 25, 2001) at p. 3 (in cases involving correction of a falsification, Personal 
Conduct Mitigating Condition 3, not Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2, is the relevant mitigating condition to be considered); ISCR Case No. 00-0671 
(August 15, 2001) at p. 3 (noting that Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2 and Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3 apply to different situations).  
Furthermore, given the record evidence in this case, the Judge reasonably could conclude that the facts and circumstances of Applicant's disclosures to the 
investigator did not warrant application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.</P> 
 
<P>The Board is not persuaded that the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that  Applicant minimized the seriousness of his reckless driving offense by 
describing it as a speeding incident.  The Board does not review isolated sentences in a Judge's decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-10215 (January 30, 
2004) at p. 6 n.4.  Reading the decision below in its entirety, the Board concludes the Judge's challenged statement forms a part of the Judge's evaluation of the 
overall facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's disclosures to the government about his past conduct.  Furthermore, in evaluating Applicant's 
falsification of the security clearance application, the Judge reasonably could consider whether there was record evidence that shed light on whether Applicant's 
falsification was an isolated incident or otherwise mitigated.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-23365 (March 22, 2004) at p. 5 (Judge can consider record evidence 
of conduct or circumstances not alleged in the SOR to assess an applicant's credibility; evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed 
circumstances; consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable).  Considering the record as a whole, and giving due deference to the Judge's assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony, the 
Board concludes Applicant has not shown that it was arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant was minimizing the seriousness of the 
2002 reckless driving offense by characterizing it as a speeding incident.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's past criminal conduct was not mitigated</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative 
Judge should have concluded that his 2002 reckless driving offense was mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1,<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Criminal Conduct 
itigating Condition 2,<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6.<A HREF="03-07839.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) the 2002 reckless driving 
incident is more than two years old; (b) the record evidence concerning the facts and circumstances of the 2002 reckless driving incident show it was not serious 
or aggravated in nature; (c) the 2002 reckless driving incident was isolated; and (d) the 2002 reckless driving incident occurred ten years after the 1992 incident 
that resulted in grand larceny and burglary charges against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Given the Administrative Judge's sustainable finding that Applicant falsified the security clearance application, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant's 
falsification was a violation of  18 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.  <EM>See United States v. Yermian</EM>, 468 U.S. 63 (1984)(case involving conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1001 for 
falsification of a security clearance application).  That conclusion by the Judge undercuts Applicant's argument concerning the isolated nature of the 2002 
reckless driving incident.  Furthermore, Applicant's arguments concerning the nature, seriousness, and recency of the 2002 reckless driving incident reflect an 
alternate interpretation of the record evidence, but they fail to demonstrate the Judge engaged in reasoning that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when 
he evaluated that incident in assessing Applicant's security eligibility.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has not demonstrated that the 
Judge was compelled, as a matter of law or logic, to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 6 to his case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-02195 
(April 9, 2004) at p. 4 n.3 (noting that the application of the Adjudicative Guidelines is not reducible to a simple formula, but rather requires the exercise of 
sound judgment within the parameters set by the Directive).</P>
