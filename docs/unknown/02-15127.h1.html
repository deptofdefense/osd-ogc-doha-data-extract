<P>Applicant has only established her resolution of two of the ten delinquent debts addressed by the SOR that amount to $1,541.00 of the $9,905.00 of 
indebtedness.  After ample opportunity, her failure to document her assertion that she is back on regular payments of $73,144.00 student loan creates doubt as 
to whether she has done so.  So to does her failure to demonstrate improved financial status by documenting that she has paid off a car loan.  Supporting two 
children, including an autistic child, as a single parent, as well as her mother undoubtedly contribute to her financial condition.  However, these circumstances 
do not totally excuse her failure to mitigate her indebtedness by at least demonstrating a functioning plan for resolving it.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense 
Directive,<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR states 
that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information and recommends that her case 
be submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>On September 26, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2004.  A notice of hearing was 
issued on February 6, 2004 and the hearing was held on February 24, 2004.  During the hearing, six Government exhibits (Govt Ex) and the testimony of 
Applicant were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on March 12, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>PROCEDURAL ISSUE<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Without objection by Department Counsel, I granted Applicant until March 23, 2004 to provide further documentation of debt payments.  As of this date, I have 
not received further documentation from Applicant. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old database analyst employed by a defense contractor.  She is seeking a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a single parent with two children, an eight-year-old autistic son and a one-year-old daughter.  Although she has medical insurance, Applicant incurs 
an unspecified amount of medical cost for her son.  She receives approximately $100.00 per month support from the father of her daughter.  Applicant provides 
approximately $200.00 per month support to her mother, who is not in good health and whose only other means of support is Social Security.</P> 
 
<P>In September 1997, Applicant incurred a debt for medical services in the amount of $509.00.  The account was transferred to a debt collector.  On March 13, 
2003, Applicant paid the account in full with a payment of $600.00 (SOR &para; 1.h).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had a brief period of unemployment from March until June 1999.  In May 1999, Applicant incurred a debt for medical services in the amount of 
$64.00.  The account was transferred to a debt collector.  On April 10, 2003, Applicant paid $50.00 on the account, reducing the balance owed to $14.00 (SOR 
&para; 1.e).</P> 
 
<P>By February 2000, Applicant had incurred a debt in the amount of $1,032.00 to a jewelry store.  The account was transferred to a debt collector.  On September 
11, 2003, Applicant paid $600.00 to settle the account in full (SOR &para; 1.i).</P> 
 
<P>In July 2000, Applicant incurred a consolidated student loan in the amount of $73,144.00 (SOR &para; 1.g).  In July 2003, Applicant was 120 days delinquent in her 
payments on the loan.  In February 2003 she made a $40.00 payment on this account and from March through September 2003, she made seven additional 
payments of $20.00 each. </P> 
 
<P>By August 2000, Applicant had incurred a debt of $211.00 for telephone service that she has not paid.  The account was transferred to a debt collector (SOR &para; 
1.d).<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>By September 2000, Applicant had incurred a debt of $684.00 telecommunications services.  The account was transferred to a debt collector.  On April 11, 
2003, Applicant paid $50.00 on the account, reducing the balance owed to $634.00 (SOR &para; 1.c).  </P> 
 
<P>By December 2000, Applicant had incurred a debt of $182.00 to a department store.  She became delinquent on the account and it was transferred to a debt 
collector.  Applicant has not paid the debt (SOR &para; 1.f).</P> 
 
<P>On November 12, 2001, Applicant incurred debts of $354.00 (SOR &para; 1.a) and $421.00 (SOR &para; 1.b) for emergency medical services.  Neither obligation has 
been paid and both accounts were transferred to a debt collector.  On September 23, 2003, Applicant submitted a medical insurance claim for the debt addressed 
by SOR &para; 1.a. </P> 
 
<P>By February 2002, Applicant had incurred a $713.00 debt on a credit card.  She became delinquent on the account and it was transferred to a debt collector.  
Applicant has not paid the debt (SOR &para; 1.j).</P> 
 
<P>On April 1, 2002, Applicant executed an agreement with a consumer credit counseling service.  She undertook to repay approximately $1,764.00 of 
indebtedness by making monthly payments of $82.00.  Applicant did not complete the agreement.<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>April 11, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the Government's interrogatories.  Her personal financial statement reflects a negative remainder of $72.36 
after subtracting her monthly debts and expenses from her total monthly income (SOR &para; 1.k).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</P> 
 
<P>The concern is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Conditions that could  raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying include E2.A6.1.2.1, a history of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying Condition 1).  They also include 
E2.A6.1.2.3, inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A6.1.3.1, the behavior was not recent (Mitigating Condition 1), and E2.A6.1.3.3, the conditions 
that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce or separation) (Mitigating Condition 3).  They also include  E2.A6.1.3.6, the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts (Mitigating Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The record documents ten delinquent debts of Applicant that total approximately $9,905.00.  This establishes a history of Applicant not meeting her financial 
obligations as well as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  It raises both Disqualifying Condition 1 and Disqualifying Condition 3. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's major indebtedness is her $73,144.00 student loan (SOR &para; 1.g).  For most of 2003, she was only able to pay $20.00 per month on this loan.  During 
that year, she became at least 120 day delinquent in the amount of $5,785.00.  Applicant testified she had increased her monthly payment to $150.00 beginning 
in November or December 2003 and was now on a regular payment plan on the loan.   However, Applicant did not  provide documentation of this even though 
she was given ample opportunity to do so.  Her failure to provide corroboration of the payments creates doubt as to whether she has been making them.  In 
accordance with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.2.2. </SPAN>of the Directive, such doubt must be resolved in favor of national security.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has paid off two of the delinquent debts addressed by the SOR that total $1,541.00 (SOR &para; 1.h and i).  However, she has only documented additional 
payments of $50.00 each on two of the remaining seven delinquent debts addressed by the SOR (SOR &para; 1.c and e).<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant testified she reached an 
agreement on settling a credit card account without incurring additional interest by paying $50.00 per month (SOR &para; 1.j).  However, she provided no 
documentation of either the agreement or the payment.  Once again, this creates doubt concerning her assertions. </P> 
 
<P>In April 2003, Applicant provided a personal financial statement that reflects a negative remainder of $72.36 (SOR &para; 1.k).  She testified that she is now much 
better off because she paid off her automobile loan in September 2003, relieving her of a $677.00 per month payment.<A HREF="02-15127.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant did not avail 
herself of the opportunity to provide documentation.  Her failure to do so creates further doubt as to whether her financial status has significantly improved.</P> 
 
<P>It is commendable that Applicant not only provides for her children, including an autistic child, but her mother as well. Her cost for her son's condition, as well 
as support for her mother, undoubtedly contribute to her financial condition.  However, they do not totally excuse her of the responsibility for resolving her 
delinquent indebtedness.  Based on Applicant's failure to mitigate her indebtedness by at least demonstrating a functioning plan for resolving it, I find against 
Applicant. </P>
