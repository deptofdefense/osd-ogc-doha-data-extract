  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  When an Administrative Judge's findings of fact are challenged on appeal, the Board must decide whether the challenged findings of fact reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  The appealing party must do more than just disagree with a  Judge's findings of fact.  The appealing party must present a cogent reason or argument as to how or why the Judge's findings of fact are not supported by substantial  record evidence, do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence, or are otherwise legally or logically flawed.  Considering the record  evidence as a whole, the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application is sustainable.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 30, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello  issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated September 30, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant engaged in deliberate falsification.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="02-21242.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant falsified a security clearance application by failing to disclose alcohol-related incidents that occurred in September 1985 
and December 1999.  On appeal, Applicant argues that he did not deliberately try to conceal those incidents from the government.</P> 
 
<P>Part of Applicant's appeal brief consists of factual assertions that go beyond the record evidence below.   Such factual assertions constitute new evidence, which the 
Board cannot consider on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  A review of the proceedings below shows Applicant had a reasonable 
opportunity to submit evidence for consideration by the Administrative Judge in his case.  Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's findings of fact based on a proffer 
of new evidence on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review the record evidence <EM>de novo</EM> and make its own findings of fact.  As discussed earlier in this decision, when an Administrative 
Judge's findings of fact are challenged on appeal, the Board must decide whether the challenged findings of fact reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the 
record evidence as a whole.  The appealing party must do more than just disagree with a Judge's findings of fact.  The appealing party must present a cogent reason or 
argument as to how or why the Judge's findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record 
evidence, or are otherwise legally or logically flawed.</P> 
 
<P>In the proceedings below, the Administrative Judge had record evidence concerning Applicant's statements and explanations about why he did not disclose the 
September 1985 and December 1999 alcohol-related incidents when he completed the security clearance application.  Applicant's statements and explanations were 
relevant evidence that the Judge had to consider, but they were not binding or conclusive evidence.  The Judge had to consider Applicant's statements and explanations in 
light of the record as a whole and decide whether Applicant's omission of the two alcohol-related incidents was a deliberate falsification or not.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at p. 3.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's finding of falsification is sustainable.  Applicant's argument to the 
contrary is not persuasive.</P>
