<P>On December 20, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On August 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The 
SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence), and C (Foreign Preference).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 19, 2006, the case was assigned to an 
Administrative Judge.  On October 23, 2006, the case was transferred to me.  On October 30, 2006, the notice of hearing was issued.  On November 15, 2006, the hearing was held.  On November 
29, 2006, DOHA received the transcript.  I did not receive the transcript until  December 4, 2006, because I was on temporary duty in South Carolina.</P>

<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel asked for administrative notice of the following U.S. Department of State documents:  Iran Bureau of Consular Affairs Report, dated October 11, 2006 (Exhibit 
I); Iran Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Report, dated October 2006 (Exhibit II); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2005: Iran Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Report, 
dated October 12, 2006 (Exhibit III); Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6, "State Sponsors of Terror, Overview," Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 28, 2006 (Exhibit 
IV); "Recognizing Iran as a Strategic Threat: An Intelligence Challenge for the United States," Staff Report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Subcommittee on Intelligence

notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. <EM>See</EM> Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  
Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exhibits I - V, and I took administrative notice of them (R. 14-15).</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">U.S.-Iranian dual nationals have been denied permission to depart Iran documented as U.S. citizens.  To prevent the confiscation of U.S. passports, the Department of State suggests that dual 
nationals leave their U.S. passports at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate overseas for safekeeping before entering Iran, and use their Iranian passports to enter the country. . . .  Dual nationals 
must enter and leave the United States on U.S. passports. . . .  U.S. citizens who were born in Iran . . . and the children of such persons, are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities.  
Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals possess U.S. citizenship, they must enter and exit Iran bearing an Iranian passport.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant relied on the U.S. State Department's advice about using an Iranian passport for visiting Iran to avoid problems with Iranian authorities (R. 35).  Absent the State Department advice about 
retaining the Iranian passport, he would have thrown it away twenty years ago (R. 64).  He understands that he is prohibited by Iranian authorities from traveling to Iran using his U.S. passport 
because he was born in Iran and Iran still considers him to be an Iranian citizen.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  His wife is a U.S. citizen, but she has retained her Iranian passport (R. 65).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the last thirty years, Applicant has visited Iran about five times (R. 56), and in the last seven years he has visited Iran twice (R. 57-60).  His most lengthy Iranian visit was in 1989 for 4 &frac12; weeks 
(R. 39).  He met and married his current wife during his 1989 visit to Iran (R. 39).  In June 2000, he visited Iran (R. 51, 56).  His most recent use of his Iranian passport was in June 2006 (R. 60).  
For the 2006 visit, he stayed in Iran for 3 &frac12; weeks, but he does not plan to return to Iran (R. 50-51; 56).  He took his wife and daughters with him on his 2006 visit to Iran, and they stayed with his

Republic of Iran, about renouncing Iranian citizenship and was informed that it was difficult, and they declined to provide the paperwork to do so (R. 64, 74).  Approval of the Council of Ministers

process (R. 44, 72).  His father's English is not as good as his mother's, but he would apply for citizenship if he knew of a way to do so (R. 72).  They live in Iran about half of the year, and live the 
other half of the year in the United States (R. 58).  When they stay in Iran, they live with Applicant's sister (R. 58), and when they visit the United States, they stay with Applicant (R. 60).

government contractor (R. 49).  His male relatives who lived in Iran probably served in the Iranian military (R. 54).  Applicant has three daughters (R. 39-40).  His oldest daughter is 14, and the

<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying 
condition under the Directive. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating 
condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by 
Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the 
government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).</SPAN><A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

<P>Under Guideline C, "[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make 
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three of nine foreign preference disqualifying conditions (FP DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FP DC 1 applies where there has been an 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"</SPAN>exercise of dual citizenship."  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.1.  FP DC 2 applies where an applicant "possess[es] and/or use[s] a foreign passport."<EM> </EM> Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.2.  FP DC 3 applies where an 
applicant has provided "[m]ilitary service or [shown] a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.3. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1to 3 are applicable because he most recently used his Iranian passport in 2000 and 2006, and he served in the Iranian military from 1973 to 1975.  FP DC 2 applies because Applicant 
retained his Iranian passport until September 2006.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All four foreign preference mitigating conditions (FP MC) could potentially reduce security concerns in this case.  FP MC 1 applies where "[d]ual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship 
or birth in a foreign country." </SPAN> Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.1. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> FP MC 2 applies where "[i]ndicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States 
citizenship."</SPAN>  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.2. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> FP MC 3 applies when the "[a]ctivity is sanctioned by the United States."  </SPAN>Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.3.3.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> FP MC 4 applies where an applicant </SPAN>"has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.4. </P> 
 
<P>FP MC 1 does not apply because Applicant's Iranian citizenship is based on his own birth in Iran, rather than being based solely on his parent's citizenship or location of birth.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For FP MC 2, 
Applicant receives some credit because his foreign military service occurred before he obtained U.S. citizenship.</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, he used his Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen and FP MC 2 
cannot be applied.  He receives partial credit under FP MC 3 because of his reliance on the U.S. State Department advice about retention of an Iranian passport, but FP MC 3 cannot be fully applied.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999) (holding federal government must approve, authorize, consent to, or otherwise sanction the use of a foreign passport to apply FP MC 3, 
and interpreting a general State Department publication concerning dual nationality not to authorize use of a foreign passport).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FP MC 4 </SPAN>applies because he specifically offered to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  If his preference to the United States is compared to his preference to Iran, his links or associations with the 
United States are much stronger, as demonstrated by his oath of allegiance to the United States, his 29-year residence to the United States, and his spouse and children are U.S. citizens.  Moreover, 
his  possession and use of an Iranian passport was for convenience to ease entry to and exit from Iran when visiting his family residing in Iran.  Use and possession of the Iranian passport was also 
based in part on the State Department's express recommendation, and not because he wanted to show allegiance or loyalty to Iran.  Applicant surrendered his Iranian passport in September 2006.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  
In ISCR Case No. 03-04300 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006), the Appeal Board held the Judge did not err when she applied FP MC 4 stating:   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In concluding Applicant had mitigated the security concerns raised by her acts of foreign preference by application of Guideline C Mitigating Condition 4, the Administrative Judge articulated a 
rational explanation for her determination--basing it on such factors as the Applicant's strong ties and loyalties to the United States, the extensive effort undertaken by the Applicant to surrender her 
passport and renounce her Russian citizenship before the close of the record, and the fact that Applicant's lack of awareness concerning the requirements expressed in the ASDC3I memo and the 
Guideline C Mitigating Conditions may have affected the timing of her renunciation actions. There are no stated requirements in Guideline C Mitigating Condition 4 concerning when an applicant 
is required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><A NAME="7996-12"></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A>to comply with its provisions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's "strong ties and loyalties to the United States" are discussed in the "whole person" section of this decision.  As indicated in ISCR Case No. 03-04300, the timing of Applicant's 
relinquishment of his passport does not bar application of FP MC 4.  His Iranian passport was surrendered and it cannot be used for foreign travel.   Moreover, Applicant cannot return to Iran using 
his U.S. passport.  The government's security concerns under Guideline C are mitigated.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 6 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (indicating Judge's decision that Guideline C 
was mitigated under similar circumstances was sustainable).</P>

</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline B, </SPAN>a "security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>One of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  FI DC 1 applies where an "immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country." Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN> "Immediate family members" include a spouse, father, 
mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. Applicant's father, mother,  two sisters, mother-in-law and sister-in-law are either "immediate family members" or persons to 
whom he "has close ties of affection or obligation" or both.  They are also citizens of and live in or visit Iran.  Although some of these relatives visit or live in the United States for lengthy periods 
of time, and/or are in the process of emigrating to the United States, the group of relatives are considered as a whole.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Even if only one relative lives in Iran, this factor alone is sufficient to create 
the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006.  The mere possession of 
close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN>  However, such ties do raise a 
security concern under FI DC 1 and Applicant is required  to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.  <EM>Id</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that any of the five foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC) apply.  FI MC 1 recognizes that security concerns are 
reduced when there is "[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not agents 
of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the U.S.  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 
5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board has held that "An employee of a foreign government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security duties to be an 
agent of a foreign power" for purposes of FI MC 1.  ISCR Case No. 02-24254 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004).  In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has broadly defined "agent of a foreign power."<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  
</P> 
 
<P>The second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the "associate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States." The Appeal Board interprets this language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must 
affirmatively prove that there is <EM>no possibility </EM>that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or acquaintance in the future. <EM> See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 
2006) ("[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate that his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty 
to them and his loyalty to the United States."); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005). </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 1 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants with relatives or associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it excludes person from countries 
where there are foreign governments, foreign political organizations, or foreign non-governmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very specific type of threat-the risk of a foreign power 
exploiting an applicant's foreign relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act adversely to the interests of the United States. The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI MC 1 
where there is a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in question.  ISCR Case No. 03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005).</P> 
 
<P>His father, mother, two sisters, mother-in-law and sister-in-law are citizens of Iran, but they do not work for the government of Iran.  The evidence does not establish that his family members living 
in Iran are agents of Iran or any other foreign power.</P> 
 
<P>The nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to 
government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent 
upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The hostility of Iran to the United States places a "very heavy burden of persuasion" on 
Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in Iran do not pose security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family 
members.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> With its adversarial stance and its dismal human rights record, it is conceivable that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the United States.</P> 
 
<P>There is no evidence that his elderly father and mother, his two sisters, his mother-in-law, or his sister-in-law are or have been, political activists or journalists, challenging the policies of the Iranian 
government. Likewise, there is no evidence that these relatives work for the Iranian government or military or any news media.  There is no evidence that the Iranian government has approached any 
of his Iranian family for any reason, and in particular, has not approached them since his visits to Iran in 2000 and 2006.  There is no evidence that his family living in Iran engages in activities 
which would bring attention to themselves or that they are even aware of his work.  As such, there is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Iranian 
government, which regularly seeks to quiet those which speak out against it.  Applicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that Iran will exploit his family, but FI MC 1 cannot 
be applied in this case because even if there was substantial evidence of the "family members' low-key noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian government has not contacted them 
about Applicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to support the application of FI MC 1" because of the nature of the Iranian government and its relationship to the United States.  <EM>See</EM> n. 33, 
<EM>infra</EM> (explaining that absence of evidence does not shift burden to government to prove anything in security clearance cases).</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where "contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant has monthly contacts by telephone 
with his family members living in Iran, they visit him or stay with him when they visit in the United States, and he stayed with his sister and her family when he visited Iran in June 2006.  He also 
provides minimal financial support to his parents. FI MC 3 does not apply because his contacts with them are not casual and infrequent. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006) (finding contacts with  applicant's parents and sisters in Iran a total of about 20 times per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding 
contacts with applicant's siblings in Iran once every four or five months not casual and infrequent).<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>     </P> 
 
<P>Finally, none of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative. Rather, these circumstances must be considered together under the "whole person concept," which includes 
consideration of the absence of evidence concerning: his family's lack of governmental connections; and the absence of financial dependence on the Iranian government.  On the other hand, the 
nature of Iran's government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the United States create "a very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns raised by the fact that 
the Applicant has family members living in Iran."  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (making findings about Iran's relationship with the United States and the potential for 
foreign influence, reversing Administrative Judge and ordering denial of clearance).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible, and there is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to his U.S. family or to this 
country.  If the Iranian government should threaten harm to his family members living in Iran to obtain classified information from him or otherwise contact him, I am persuaded that he would 
report this activity to the U.S. authorities.  There is no evidence that he has failed to follow the rules or failed to require those around him to do the same on projects requiring security clearances. 
There is no evidence that he lacks the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, and family or that he lacks honesty and integrity.  There is no evidence that he has revealed to his family in Iran 
the nature of his work or about applying for a security clearance.  I cannot, however, find that Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns as to Guideline B because the absence of 
evidence does not overcome the heavy burden the Appeal Board has established through case law concerning security clearances for applicant's from Iran.<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></SPAN></P> 
</A> 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under 
Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors which are used for "whole person" analysis.  Foreign influence and foreign preference do not involve misconduct, 
voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc.  Accordingly, the eighth adjudicative process factor is probably the most relevant. </SPAN> Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1.8.  </SPAN>The eighth factor 
provides, "the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Iran's government is hostile to the United States and does not conform to widely accepted norms of human rights.  
Applicant has close, multiple family members who live in Iran.  He has frequent contact with them.  Under the circumstances, there is a significant possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or 
duress.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As indicated in the statement of facts, there are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant's life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting a clearance.  He is patriotic, loves the 
United States, and would not permit Iran to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United States.  </SPAN>His closest family members are his wife and three daughters.  They are U.S citizens and live with 
him.  Because his wife and children live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power, except possibly indirectly through relatives, who still live or visit 
Iran<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  He has lived in the United States 29 years.  He owns property in the United States, and most of his Iranian relatives are in the process of moving to the United States.  The "whole person" 
analysis in a Guideline B case should include "the totality of an applicant's conduct and circumstance[s] (including the realistic potential for exploitation)" as well as the eighth factor discussed in 
the previous paragraph.<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  In this case, Applicant's potential for exploitation is low.  I base this finding on his credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe he would compromise national 
security, or otherwise comply with any Iranian threats.  However</SPAN>, the absence of evidence<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> under the Appeal Board's jurisprudence is of very limited probative value, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and information about his 
strong connections to the United States are insufficient to outweigh the Guideline B concerns.  <EM>See</EM> n. 30, <EM>supra</EM>. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not </SPAN>mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  </P> 
 
<P>In 2005 and 2006, the Appeal Board addressed Guideline B or C cases involving Iranian Americans on at least twenty-two occasions.  While there is no <EM>per se </EM>requirement to deny clearances for 
U.S. citizens who contact their relatives living in Iran,<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> over the last two years the Appeal Board has reversed<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP> <A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> all decisions except one<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> approving clearances, and affirmed<A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A><SUP>, </SUP><A HREF="06-17164.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> all

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the Appeal Board's Guideline B jurisprudence pertaining to cases involving Iranian-Americans, who have frequent contacts with family members living in Iran, Applicant's security

Iran is sufficient to negate FI MC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative's fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced

(ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives spend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of any connection 
between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 
03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country's friendly relationship with the U.S., its stable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the U.S. (ISCR 
Case No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)); and an applicant's "refusal to travel to Iran" and "meticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work" (ISCR 
Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). 
<P><A NAME="N_32_">32. </A><EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth whole person factor apparently without discussion of the other factors was sustainable);

Iranian family members); <EM>with</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess "the realistic potential for exploitation"). 
<P><A NAME="N_34_">34. </A>There is no record evidence to contradict Applicant's testimony that establishes: (1) any connection or contact between Applicant and any foreign government; (2) any financial interests between 
Applicant and any foreign nation, or any foreign business concern; (3) his failure to follow the rules or his failure to require those around him to do the same on projects requiring security 
clearances; (4) any lack of the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, or family; and (5) a problem in the areas of honesty or integrity.  I conclude, however, that the government has no burden 
to present such evidence, and the absence of evidence does not support application of any mitigating conditions.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA LEXIS 229, at *39-*41 (A.J. May 17, 
2006) (discussing absence of evidence and relationship to burden shifting).  For example, as indicated in ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 10 (App. Bd. Oct. 27,2005), there is no reason for Iran to 
contact him until he receives access to classified information, and lack of foreign financial interests do not mitigate Guideline B security concerns based on an applicant's relationship with relatives. 
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2006).  Of course, Applicant has had a security clearance in the past, and Iran has not contacted him or his relatives living in Iran.
