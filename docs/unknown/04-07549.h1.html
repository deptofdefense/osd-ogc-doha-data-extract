<P>Although not alleged, the Applicant has "expressed a willingness to renounce" his Lebanese citizenship.  He has also surrendered his Lebanese passport in 
compliance with the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM> ("Guide to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of Foreign Preference 
Adjudication Guidelines," dated September 1, 2000).  The Applicant has four siblings who are citizens of and reside in Lebanon.  One brother works for the 
Lebanese Department of Labor as a low level facilitator.  This brother has been approved for permanent residency status in the U.S., and intends to move to the 
U.S., where this brother's two children attend college.  The other three siblings have no connection with any foreign government.  The Applicant is not subject 
to coercion vis-a-vis his foreign relatives.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 9, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on June 17, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on October 20, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 1, 2005, and the case was heard on November 8, 
2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript 
(TR) was received on November 22, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and alleged Foreign Influence 
militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">50 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant has four siblings who are citizens of and reside in Lebanon (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at pages 3~4).  One brother works for the 
Lebanese Department of Labor as a low level facilitator (TR at page 17 line 24 to page 18 line 6, and at page 28 line 9 to page 32 line 4).  This brother has been 
approved for permanent residency status in the U.S., and intends to move to the U.S., where this brother's two children already attend college (<EM>Id</EM>).  The 
Applicant has another brother who is a "peanut distributor" (TR at page 27 line 15 to page 28 line 8).  The Applicant has had no contact with this brother for 
"about 12 to 13 years" (<EM>Id</EM>).  The Applicant has two elderly sisters (TR at page 25 line 17 to page 26 line 20).  One is retired from "an insurance company," and 
the other is a housewife (<EM>Id</EM>).  These last three siblings have no connection with any foreign government.  The Applicant has traveled to Lebanon in 1998 and 
again in 2001, to visit his relatives (TR at page 18 line 19 to page 19 line 15, and at page 34 lines 20~23).  He intends no future trips to Lebanon (TR at page 32 
lines 22~24).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant came to the U.S. nearly 30 years ago to escape its civil war (TR at page 22 line 5 to page 23 line 13).  He attended college in the U.S. and was 
naturalized as an American in 1984 (<EM>Id</EM>, and GX 1 at page 1).  His wife is a native born American as is their child (TR at page 32 line 25 to page 34 line 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant applied for and was issued a Lebanese passport in 1998 (GX 1 at page 1).  He used this passport to enter and exit Lebanon in 1998 
and again in 2001 (TR at page 18 line 19 to page 19 line 15).  It expired in 2003.  However, he has surrendered his Lebanese passport in compliance with the 
<EM>Money Memorandum</EM> (Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) 8).  Although it is not alleged, the Applicant has also "expressed a willingness to renounce" his Lebanese 
citizenship (TR at page 19 line 16 to page 20 line 21).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's supervisors think most highly of him (AppX 5 at pages 1~2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to a Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that 
are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by 
all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual national with Lebanon, and until recently maintained an expired Lebanese passport.  The first and second disqualifying conditions under 
Foreign Preference are therefore applicable as there was an "exercise of dual citizenship," with the "possession . . . of a foreign passport."  This is countered, 
however, by his compliance with the last mitigating condition.  Even though it is not alleged, the Applicant "has expressed a willingness to renounce [his] dual 
citizenship," and he has complied with the <EM>Money Memorandum,</EM> when he surrendered his Lebanese passport.  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline C is found for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's four siblings reside in Lebanon.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence is therefore applicable as "[a]n immediate family 
member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  However, three of the Applicant's four siblings are not connected with any government, 
and there is no evidence that their presence in Lebanon can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant 
would even consider any such attempt at exploitation vis-avis any of his four siblings (TR at page 24 lines 8~15, and at page 35 line 19 to page 36 line 8).  The 
Applicant's fourth sibling is "connected with . . . a foreign government," </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as a low level facilitator </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">with their Labor Department.  Thus the third disqualifying 
condition is also applicable.  This brother, however, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has been approved for permanent residency status in the U.S., and he intends to move to the U.S., where his 
two children already attend college. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> This brother's Foreign Influence over the Applicant, if any, is negligible.  Mitigation is again shown.  Guideline B is also 
found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
