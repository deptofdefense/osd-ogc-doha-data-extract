<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant wilfully misrepresented her marijuana use on clearance applications in 1989, February 1997 and July 2003, rendering her an unsuitable candidate for 
access to classified information. She also used marijuana while holding a clearance and has not demonstrated the required intent to refrain from drug use in the 
future. Clearance denied.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Applicant challenges the 20 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
her clearance because of drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> She answered the SOR 8 August 2005, and requested a hearing. DOHA 
assigned the case to me 28 September 2004 and I heard it 17 October 2005. DOHA received the transcript 28 October 2005.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted buying marijuana (1.b.) and deliberately falsifying two clearance applications (2.b., 2.e., and 3.a.). She denied the remaining allegations of 
the SOR. Accordingly I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 47-year-old custom evaluation analyst  employed by a defense contractor since 
June 2004.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She has held an industrial clearance since approximately 1989.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant used marijuana at varying frequency from 1978 to fall 2004. Her period of "regular" marijuana use<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> was between 1978 and the early 1990s. She 
used marijuana sporadically since then until fall 2004.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Early in her marijuana use, she purchased small amounts for her personal use or contributed to 
purchases for use in a group.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>When Applicant first applied for a clearance in 1989, she deliberately failed to disclose her drug use as required by the application (2.g.). She did so because she 
feared she would not get her clearance, and because she might lose her job. When she applied for an upgrade in access in February 1997, she deliberately failed 
to disclose her use of marijuana within the last seven years (2.d.) and her use of marijuana after being granted a clearance (2.e.). She did so because she feared 
both the effect of her drug use on her clearance and the effect of disclosing her past falsification on her clearance. She also failed  to disclose her marijuana 
purchases (2.f.) because she had never been involved in any purchases for profit and because her purchases fell outside the 7-year window asked by the 
question. When Applicant completed a clearance application for her periodic reinvestigation in July 2003, she deliberately failed to disclose her use of 
marijuana within the last seven years (2.a.) and her use of marijuana after being granted a clearance (2.b.). She did so because she feared the effect of disclosing 
her past falsifications on her clearance. She also failed  to disclose her marijuana purchases (2.c.) because she had never been involved in any purchases for 
profit and because her purchases fell outside the 7-year window asked by the question.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's falsifications over the years began to weigh on her. When she was interviewed  for her clearance in December 2003, the agent went through her 
application asking for corrections or changes to her answers. When the agent got to the drug questions (27-29), Applicant revealed the truth about her drug 
history. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has acknowledged that she was aware that her marijuana use was unlawful, contrary to government policy, and contrary to her employers' policies. 
She does not believe that her marijuana use ever put classified information at risk. Nevertheless, she has stated her intent to refrain from drug use in the future 
in order to retain her clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's character references uniformly praise her honesty and integrity. However, only one reference appears to be fully aware of Applicant's misconduct. A 
few more describe their awareness of Applicant's "mistakes." Most do not appear to be aware of any of the issues in the SOR.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima 
faciecase against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a 
security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>The government established a Guideline H<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> case and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although her last marijuana use was in fall 2004, her 
drug use while cleared raises particular concerns about her suitability for a clearance.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Further, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for drug involvement. Her drug use is recent.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> It is not isolated or aberrational.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> While she now 
vows to remain drug free that vow is directly connected to retaining her clearance, and is undercut by her use of marijuana in fall 2004--after her most recent 
clearance application and subject interview. Consequently, she has failed to demonstrate intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I 
conclude Guideline H against Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government also established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. She deliberately misrepresented her drug history on three 
clearance applications over fourteen years.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> She did so to first obtain, then retain, her clearance. Her conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared 
personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. 
The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about 
herself provides some indication of her willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government 
relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests she is willing to put her 
personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was relevant to a clearance decision.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The falsifications were not isolated, 
they were recent, although the Applicant did eventually provide the correct information voluntarily.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> And while she did disclose her drug use before being 
confronted with it, that disclosure cannot be considered either prompt or good faith within the meaning of the guideline, given the passage of more than four 
months from the last falsified clearance application and her December 2003 subject interview.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence suggesting Applicant received bad 
advice about what she was required to disclose on her clearance application.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> However, I conclude that she did not falsify her 1997 and 2003 applications 
when she failed to disclose her drug purchases, both because she never did so for profit and because the purchases occurred outside the 7-year window required 
by the question. Nevertheless, I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government established a Guideline J case, and the Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Her multiple falsifications on her clearance 
applications violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> None of the Guideline J mitigating factors apply. Her conduct is recent,<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> not isolated,<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> and there is little evidence 
of successful rehabilitation.<A HREF="04-12549.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.<BR>
