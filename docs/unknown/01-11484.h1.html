<P>Applicant's multiple falsifications suggested that she could not be relied upon to state the truth if the truth presented potential adverse consequences to her 
personal interest. Her drug use was not mitigated where she had used drugs while possessing a security clearance and presented insufficient evidence to 
demonstrate an intent to not use drugs in the future. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 25 January 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 4 
April 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's initial File of 
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 15 April 2002, which Applicant received 13 May 2002. While further processing was pending, Applicant's employer 
administratively terminated Applicant's clearance, effective 12 June 2002.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> However, the case was later reopened, ostensibly because Applicant was now with 
a new employer.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The FORM was reissued, unchanged, on 6 November 2002. On 6 December 2002, Applicant responded to the FORM; the record in this case 
closed 18 December 2002, the day Department Counsel indicated no objection to the response. The case was assigned to me on 20 December 2002, and 
received by me the same day, to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 40-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain access to classified information that she has held since at least March 2000.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 2 February 2000, Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF-86)(Item 5) when she answered "no" to a question which required her to 
disclose any use of illegal drugs within the last seven years (question 27). On 25 September 2000 Applicant repeated her falsification of her drug abuse history 
when she executed a sworn statement before an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), as follows:<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . I had never used marijuana or any other illegal drugs in my life and had no intentions of using the drug I was carrying in that small wooden box. . . Although 
a friend of mine did give me that small wooden box containing marijuana, I have never been around her while she was using the drug. I have never used 
marijuana or any other illegal drugs in my life, have otherwise never possessed illegal drugs, and have no future intentions of using or otherwise being involved 
with illegal drugs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On or about 25 January 2001, Applicant continued to falsify her drug abuse history during an interview with a different special agent of the DSS (a 
polygrapher). She first asserted that she had used liquid speed once in 1977 and marijuana once in 1980, then later asserted that she had not used marijuana 
since 1988. In fact, Applicant first used marijuana in 1978, smoking it about 50 times between 1977 and 1980. She used liquid speed a few times between 1977 
and 1980 while a military dependent living in Germany, where the drug is available over-the-counter.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> She used marijuana on an occasional basis between 
1980 and approximately 20 April 1998, when she had the marijuana confiscated at the airport.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She has not used marijuana since then. She states that she will 
not use drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant categorically admitted the SOR  allegations without comment, her cover letter minimizes her drug abuse history, and attempts to distance 
herself from her sworn statements asserting in both instances that the agents ignored her obvious and stated discomfort and pain related to two neck surgeries, 
one sometime before her first interview in September 2000, the other approximately six weeks after her September 2000 interview. She asserts that the first 
agent asked her only about her drug use since high school, but then asked her to sign a statement covering her whole life--a statement she claims she read very 
quickly and incompletely in her haste to get the interview over.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find Applicant's explanations not credible. Applicant's September 2000 statement specifically denies any drug abuse in the context of her having been stopped 
with marijuana in an airport in April 1998 and having the drug confiscated. Applicant clearly presents herself as someone who is mystified that her friend--"an 
occasional use of marijuana"--gave Applicant a small wooden box to take on the plane. Indeed, Applicant's first categorical statement that "I had never used 
marijuana or any other illegal drugs in my life and had 'no intentions of using' the drug I was carrying in that small wooden box" had a pen and ink 
correction--initialed by Applicant--inserting 'no intentions of using' in place of the original language, 'would not have used' the drug. . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, Applicant's second statement records an incident of her using a prescription muscle relaxer given to her by a co-worker when her back 
started giving her trouble while on a business trip (not prescribed for Applicant, but ostensibly used correctly for her back pain in the broader sense). However, 
the claimed indifference of the polygrapher to Applicant's stated pain during the interview--if true--would constitute a violation of Government policy, as well 
as the practical tainting of any polygraph results. Applicant provides no corroboration of her claim of misconduct, and I will not presume any.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's December response to the FORM is essentially a plea that I retain her clearance notwithstanding her admitted falsifications, which she now 
attributes to her fear about how admitting her past drug use would effect her current job. The record otherwise contains no information on her character or work 
performance.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. The information sought by the Government on the clearance application and during the two subject 
interviews was relevant and material to the Government's investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, and the Applicant 
knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. Applicant categorically denied any drug use in her first statement, and appears to have not disclosed her 
complete drug history during the pre-test phase of her polygraph. Her failure to fully disclose the her drug abuse history until the post-test phase of the 
polygraph suggests that she cannot be relied upon to speak the truth if the truth presents possible adverse consequences for her own interests. She knew the 
answers she provided were false; and indeed she knew the answers had to be false for her to get what she wanted--a security clearance.<A HREF="01-11484.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> At no time before her 
final discussions with the polygrapher did Applicant make any effort to fully disclose the details of her drug abuse, much less a prompt, good-faith effort. I 
resolve guideline E. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under guideline H and I find the conduct not mitigated. Although Applicant's drug use from 1992 to 1998 does not 
appear to be extensive, she appears to have used drugs during times when she had access to classified information, a situation which will almost invariably call 
for revocation of her clearance. While an argument can be made that her last use in April 1998 is not recent, overall her drug use cannot be considered isolated 
or aberrational. Nor, under the circumstances of this case, can I consider Applicant to have demonstrated an intent to not use drugs in the future. While there is 
no record evidence to suggest that Applicant has used drugs after the last claimed use in 1998, Applicant's uncorroborated claims cannot be given full weight, 
given her credibility and falsification problems. I resolve guideline H. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J; however, I find the drug incident and the drug abuse to be mitigated. Although the criminal 
behavior was  recent, and not strictly speaking an isolated incident, I conclude that this conduct has little remaining security significance. However, Applicant's 
multiple falsifications remain disqualifying. Applicant's knowing falsifications to an agency of the federal government on matters within that agency's 
jurisdiction clearly violate 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. The falsifications had the potential to influence the course of the background investigation--in areas of legitimate 
concern to the Government--and indeed appeared to lengthen the investigation. I resolve guideline J. against the Applicant. </SPAN></P>
