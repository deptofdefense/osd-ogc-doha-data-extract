<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has failed to fulfill the requirements of the Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum) by not relinquishing his Iranian passport to the proper 
Iranian authorities, but allowing it to lapse and indicating the desire to reserve the right to renew it.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's immediate family members, including his 
mother, with whom he has close and continuing contact, and sister are citizens of and reside in Iran. The evidence establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to 
foreign influence. </SPAN>Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 
28, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign preference (guideline C) related 
to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran, and his intention to renew a foreign passport and continue to use it for travel; and on foreign 
influence (guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and citizenship of close family members.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized response dated March 24, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on September 3, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was 
reassigned to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on September 11, 2003, and the hearing was 
held on October 9, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no 
documentary exhibits but offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on October 20, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all eight allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., and 2.a. through 2.d. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 59 year old employee of a defense contractor. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He is married and has two sons.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He received a masters degree in electrical engineering from a 
United States university.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Iran in 1944 and immigrated to the United States in 1968. In 1976 he moved back to Iran with the thought of living there again, but he 
quickly changed his mind and moved back to the United States in 1977. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1978.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> retained his Iranian passport after he became a United States citizen . He traveled to Iran to visit his family in the years 1991, 1996, and 2000 (Tr at 
31) ( Exhibit1).  He used his Iranian passport on these trips. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that he does not consider himself a citizen of  Iran,  but he conceded that he 
retained and used his Iranian passport because Iran considered him an Iranian citizen  (Tr at 37, 38). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Iranian passport expired in April 2001. He took no affirmative step to </SPAN>relinquish his Iranian  passport to the proper Iranian authorities, and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he 
testified that since he cannot travel to Iran with a United States passport, he reserves the right to renew his Iranian passport (Tr at 35, 36).    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate 
family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and resides </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in Iran. He is extremely close to her and speaks to her by telephone ever other week (Tr at 31).  Applicant's 
mother owns an apartment in Iran, which Applicant may be in line to inherit with his two siblings, although the status of this property is not certain. 
(Applicant's response to the SOR). Applicant has a sister who is a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and resides</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in Iran</SPAN>, and a brother who is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 28, 29)</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or 
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:     </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>  Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>       </P> 
 
<P>E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A3.1.2.1 The exercise of dual citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A3.1.2.2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign 
influence.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines C and B:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's failure to relinquish 
his Iranian passport to the proper Iranian authorities and his stated intention to reserve the right to renew the passport raises serious foreign preference 
(guideline C) concerns. It is a violation of the Money Memorandum, and therefore Applicant is absolutely barred from retaining a security clearance. 
Applicant's unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship so that he could maintain the option of renewing his passport, must also be considered adversely 
to Applicant. Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. applies because  Applicant's use of his Iranian passport after he became a United States citizen is a 
continuing example of Applicant's exercising dual citizenship. DC  E2.A3.1.2.2. also applies because of Applicant's failure to return his passport to the proper 
authorities. No mitigating condition (MC) applies in this case under Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a 
reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. As Applicant's mother, with whom he has a very close personal relationship, and 
sister are citizens of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that 
this family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). The Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate 
family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security 
clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This Applicant has not been able to do. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are citizens of Iran, comes within DC </SPAN> E2.A2.1.2.1.  I conclude that the potential to inherit an 
interest in an apartment is so tenuous that  DC E2.A2.1.2.8. does not apply.  No MC applies under Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of foreign influence , I conclude that the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any 
mitigating evidence.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline C:  AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1. a.:  Against the Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against the Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
