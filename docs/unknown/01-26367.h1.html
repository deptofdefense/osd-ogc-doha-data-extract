<P>Applicant's episodic abuse of alcohol has led to criminal incidents, including a January 2001 drunk driving offense.  The risk of future alcohol abuse and 
related criminal conduct cannot be discounted, given he continues to drink on occasion in similar quantities to what he had consumed before his arrests.  
Applicant deliberately did not disclose his 1999 arrest for rape on his security clearance application or during his first subject interview.  His intentional 
concealment raises serious personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 25, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on criminal conduct (guideline J), alcohol consumption (guideline G) and personal 
conduct (guideline E).</P> 
 
<P>On December 3, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the written record.<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Sometime after the Government's 
File of Relevant Material was prepared, Applicant requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge, and the case was assigned to me March 14, 2003.  
Pursuant to formal notice dated March 27, 2003, the hearing was scheduled for, and held on, April 24, 2003.  At the hearing, eight Government exhibits were 
admitted into the record.<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's case consisted of his testimony, as reflected in a transcript received by DOHA on May 6, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges criminal conduct because of 1998 disorderly conduct and 2001 drunk driving offenses, his arrest in 1999 for a felony rape charge that  was 
nolle prossed, and deliberate falsification of his November 2000 security clearance application (SF 86); excessive alcohol consumption with alcohol-related 
criminal conduct; and personal conduct because of his failure to list his arrest for felony rape on his SF 86.  In his Answer, Applicant admitted the criminal 
charges, but denied the disorderly conduct was alcohol-related.  In response to an allegation of continuing to drink both during the week and on weekends, 
occasionally to intoxication, Applicant indicated he now drinks only on the weekends.  As for his failure to report his arrest for rape on his SF 86, Applicant 
acknowledged he "made a mistake on the question."  After a thorough review and consideration of the evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 25-year-old control center operator employed since late September 2000 in the security department of a defense contractor.  He held an interim 
secret security clearance for his duties until it was withdrawn in about March 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant began to consume alcohol when he was a sophomore in high school.  He continued to drink throughout high school on weekends when he could 
obtain alcohol.  Since he was underage, liquor was hard to come by.  When Applicant imbibed, it was usually to intoxication.  After his graduation, Applicant 
became employed as a production supervisor.  Over the next five years, he drank on weekends--occasionally to intoxication--when out socializing with 
friends.  At times, he also imbibed one or two beers after work at home during the work week.</P> 
 
<P>His consumption of alcohol led to adverse legal involvement on three occasions.  In late February 1998, he was arrested for disorderly conduct after he refused 
to leave a billiards and bowling establishment when requested to do so.  Applicant had an obvious odor of alcohol on his person, and he put up a physical 
struggle as he was taken into custody.  In March 1998, sufficient facts were found, and the case was continued without a finding on payment of a $100.00 fine.</P> 
 
<P>In June 1999, Applicant went to work as a laborer for a construction company.  In mid-July 1999, Applicant and a male friend agreed to purchase beer for three 
teenage girls (then ages 15, 16, and 17),<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> who they met in a local record store.  The girls accompanied Applicant and his friend to the liquor store, where 
Applicant's friend purchased a case of beer, and then to the friend's home, where all proceeded to drink.  During the course of the evening, Applicant consumed 
about six or seven beers and had sexual intercourse with the 16-year-old, who had imbibed at least four beers.  Two days later, the girl complained to the police 
that Applicant had raped her.  When questioned by the police, Applicant indicated the girl had consented to having sex with him.  Four days after the house 
party, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony rape and with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  Circa late September 1999, the charges were 
nolle prossed.  In October 1999, Applicant moved to seal the record, which was granted.<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>After short employments in retail and as a dispatcher, Applicant in late September 2000 secured a position as a control center operator in the security 
department of his present employer.  In conjunction with his duties, he executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on November 3, 2000, on which he 
responded affirmatively to inquiries concerning a police record in the last 7 years, disclosing his 1998 disorderly conduct.  Applicant answered "NO" to whether 
he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense (question 21 thereon), deliberately concealing from the Government that he had been arrested 
for rape in 1999.  Since the court records had been sealed, he thought no one would find out about it.  Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance for his 
duties.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant continued to drink one or two beers occasionally during the week, and on weekend nights when out with friends, at times to intoxication.  After 
imbibing about seven beers at a Super Bowl party in late January 2001, Applicant was stopped for speeding and marked lanes violation.  He failed field sobriety 
tests and was arrested for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of liquor (OUIL).  Sufficient facts were found for OUIL, and his case was continued 
without a finding for one year on payment of $250.00 costs and $160.00 to victim funds, completion of an alcohol safety action program (ASAP) and loss of his 
operating privileges for sixty days.  Applicant attended a local ASAP in June and July 2001, consisting of 14 educational sessions focusing on the dangers of 
drinking and driving.</P> 
 
<P>After his arrest for OUIL, Applicant was careful not to drive after drinking more than three beers.  On August 9, 2001, Applicant was interviewed by a special 
agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS).  Applicant discussed his arrests for disorderly conduct and OUIL, the latter having occurred after he completed his 
SF 86.  Applicant denied he was intoxicated on the occasion of the disorderly conduct, and indicated he had only given his friend, who had been in a fight at the 
lounge, a congratulatory "high five."  Applicant acknowledged he had driven while intoxicated in January 2001, but he completed the ASAP in July 2001, and 
reported his OUIL to his supervisors.  He falsely denied he had been arrested for any other reason, as he did not think the Government would be able to find out 
about his arrest for rape in 1999.  Asked about his drinking pattern, Applicant admitted continuing to imbibe alcohol in the same pattern since high school, 
occasionally to intoxication, but he maintained he no longer drove a car after consuming more than two or three beers.  Applicant denied that he had an alcohol 
problem, or that anyone had ever claimed he has an alcohol problem.</P> 
 
<P>On August 22, 2001, Applicant was interviewed by the agent about his 1999 arrest for rape and failure to disclose that arrest on his SF 86.  Applicant told the 
agent he had consumed one or two beers and that one of the girls had led him into a bedroom where they engaged in consensual sex.  He expressed his belief 
that the charges were dropped because the girl "changed her story a number of times."  Applicant admitted he intentionally did not disclose the charge on his SF 
86 because he believed the information had been sealed and no one had access to it.</P> 
 
<P>As of April 2003, Applicant was drinking alcohol on the weekends, about five or six beers when together with friends and not driving, three beers at most when 
driving.  On occasion when  he had a "rough day," he consumed a couple of beers at the end of the workday.  Over the weekend of April 19-20, 2003, Applicant 
imbibed six beers during a three hour period while watching a sporting event on television with a friend.  Applicant considers his drinking to be moderate.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section 
E2.2.4. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">The Concern</SPAN>:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and

<P>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>None</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">* * *</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J, G and E:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's February 1998 disorderly conduct and January 2001 OUIL raise security concerns under guideline J, criminal conduct (<EM>see</EM> disqualifying conditions 
a. allegations or admissions of criminal conduct and b. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and guideline G, alcohol consumption (<EM>see</EM> DC 
E2.A7.1.2.1.   alcohol-related incidents away from work).  Applicant denies he was intoxicated on the occasion of his arrest for disorderly conduct.  The 
responding officer detected an "obvious" odor of alcohol on Applicant.  Furthermore, Applicant displayed impaired judgment in physically resisting  arrest.  
Clearly, Applicant was under the influence of alcohol to a significant extent, if not to the point of legal intoxication.  Applicant does not dispute, and his blood 
alcohol content at the time of arrest confirms, that he was legally intoxicated on the occasion of the OUIL.</P> 
 
<P>With regard to the 1999 rape and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, both charges were nolle prossed.  The failure to prosecute does not preclude the 
Department of Defense from considering whether he engaged in the conduct complained of, but as conceded by Department Counsel, the evidence is 
insufficient to prove Applicant committed felony rape.  Applicant has consistently maintained the sexual encounter was consensual.  The girl admitted during 
the police investigation that she had hugged and kissed Applicant on the sofa before the alleged rape.  Consent to sex cannot be presumed from such minor 
contact, but Applicant is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   Assuming Applicant did not rape the girl, he 
exhibited extremely poor judgment in facilitating the underage consumption of alcohol by the girls.  Applicant had consumed as many as six or seven beers that 
evening himself, which casts  further doubt as to the quality of his judgment when drinking.</P> 
 
<P>Since his 2001 OUIL, Applicant has changed his drinking behavior, in that he no longer drives after consuming more than three beers.  Despite this positive 
change supportive of sobriety (<EM>see</EM> mitigating condition E2.A7.1.3.3), there exists an unacceptable risk of future alcohol abuse and even alcohol-related criminal 
incidents.  Applicant continues to consume alcohol when socializing with friends in amount similar to that imbibed on the occasion of his OUIL.  When asked 
at his security clearance hearing about his current consumption levels, Applicant described his drinking as moderate and he denied drinking to intoxication 
since he attended the court-ordered ASAP in June 2001.  However, in response to specific inquiry as to the greatest amount consumed in a single sitting since 
June 2001, Applicant responded "maybe five or six beers."  Applicant then admitted drinking six beers when with a friend the weekend prior to his security 
clearance hearing.  He testified to a pattern of drinking six beers when watching local professional teams on television unless he has to drive home.  Absent a 
diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the Directive does not require abstention from alcohol.  Yet, in light of Applicant's history of recent and 
repeated legal trouble after imbibing about six or seven beers, his present drinking habits present an unacceptable security risk.  When one is under the 
influence of a mood-altering substance such as alcohol, there is a risk of inadvertent disclosure of classified information.  Adverse findings are warranted as to 
subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. (as to the contributing to the delinquency of a minor), 1.c., 2.a., 2.b., 2.c. and 2.d. of the SOR.</P> 
 
<P>Furthermore, on his security clearance application, Applicant was required to report any felony charge filed against him, regardless of whether the records had 
been sealed.  Applicant intentionally omitted any reference to the 1999 rape and contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he did not think anyone 
would have access to the information and the charge of rape made him look like "scum."  By falsely certifying that his statements on his security clearance 
application were "true, complete and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," Applicant violated Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code.<A HREF="01-26367.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  
Under guideline J, the fact that Applicant has never been formally charged with that statute does not preclude its consideration for security purposes, as any 
criminal conduct is potentially security disqualifying.  Applicant's lack of candor about his arrest for rape engenders serious criminal conduct (<EM>see </EM>DC a.  
allegations or admission of criminal conduct) as well as guideline E, personal conduct, concerns (<EM>see</EM> DC E2.A5.1.2.2. the deliberate omission of relevant and 
material facts from a personnel security questionnaire).</P> 
 
<P>His falsification was not limited to the SF 86.  Even though Applicant provided details of the disorderly conduct and OUIL criminal offenses when he was 
interviewed by the DSS agent on August 9, 2001, he falsely claimed that he had not been arrested for any other reason, to include alcohol related offenses.   
This misrepresentation to the agent is potentially security disqualifying in its own right (<EM>see</EM> E2.A5.1.2.3.).  Under the circumstances, Applicant's subsequent 
admission  during his August 22, 2001, interview that he had been arrested for rape, and his account of the circumstances which led to his arrest,  cannot 
reasonably be considered a prompt or good faith effort at rectification.  In response to the SOR, Applicant indicated he made a mistake on question 21, as he 
wanted to forget about the incident and it was "hard for [him] to go through, knowing that someone could deliberately lie about [his] character."  By choosing 
to lie during his interview of August 8, 2001, Applicant placed his own character in doubt.  Subparagraphs 1.d. and 3.a. are resolved against him, as he has 
failed to persuade that he can be counted on to place his obligations to the Government before his self-interest.</P>
