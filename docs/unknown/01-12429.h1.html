<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>While associated as the secretary-treasurer and comptroller of a defense contractor (Company A), Applicant was indicted (along with the defense contractor and 
other officers) for inflating labor claims on terminated subcontracts to be reimbursed.  Applicant and the other defendants were also made defendants in a 
number of civil suits arising out of the same conduct covered in the indictment.  By virtue of a global settlement reached in June 1998 between the Government 
and the defendants, Company A (a company of about 800 employees) pleaded guilty to one count of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (a felony) and agreed to pay 
a fine, reimburse the Government for the costs of its investigation and settle the civil claims with a $6.5 million payment.  The criminal charges and civil claims 
against Applicant and the other individual defendants were, in turn, dismissed with prejudice.  The settlement agreement didn't foreclose the AF from 
processing debarment and suspension actions, which it did (for five years ending in December 1998).  Neither Applicant nor any of his fellow defendants were 
found by the AF's inspector general to have been implicated in any wrongdoing associated with the acts covered by the indictment and civil suits. </P> 
<P>Based on the reports of the company insurance carriers disbursing reimbursement checks to discharge the agreed claims in the global settlement, no acts of 
wrongdoing can be attributed to Applicant or any of the other covered members of Company A's director and officer insurance policies.  No active involvement 
or culpable knowledge can be attributed either to Applicant arising out of the subject matter covered in the indictment and the civil suits based on a thorough 
review of the entire record presented.  Trustworthiness endorsements of Applicant come from company colleagues, representatives of both Government and 
private customers.</P> 
<P>Company A demonstrates considerable rehabilitation as an active Government contractor.  Not only has Company A continued to accept work on DoD 
contracts under waivers since the issuance of the indictments, but it has since returned to regular Government contracting, all indicative of the company's 
rehabilitation.   Considering all of the evidence in the record,  Applicant exhibits  himself to be reliable and trustworthy and free of any implicated wrongdoing 
in any of his company's concluded criminal and civil actions.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 2, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on October 26, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 18, 2001, and 
was scheduled for hearing on January 2, 2002.  A hearing was convened on February 11, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four 
exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and seventeen exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on February 20, 
2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the hearing, Government moved to amend sub-paragraph 1.d of the SOR to delete Applicant and the other Company A officers as individuals debarred 
by the AF in October 1998 and, as such, conform to the evidence.  There being no objections from Applicant, and good cause being demonstrated the 
amendment motion was granted.  Applicant, in turn, amended his answer to deny his ever being formally debarred by the AF.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave for the record to be kept open to permit him the opportunity to supplement the record.  There being 
no objections, and good cause being shown, Applicant was granted an additional seven (7) days in which to supplement the record.  Government was granted 
three (3) days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with Company A's annual reports for the years 1989 through1994, an 
October 1, 1994 memorandum from Company B's subcontract manager and a November 27, 1995 deposition of Company B's subcontractor manager.  
Government's offering no objections to these submitted exhibits, and good cause being shown, Applicant's submissions are admitted as exhibits  Y through 
AA.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 55-year old former secretary/treasurer/comptroller of his defense contractor (Company A) who seeks restoration of his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged, at all times relevant, to have been an employee and officer (corporate secretary/treasurer /comptroller) of Company A since approximately 
August 1979, and an officer of the company when a Government investigation was initiated in late 1989, following reported allegations he and other 
employee/officers of Company A caused labor records to be falsified to support inflated claims on terminated sub-contracts, for which he was to be reimbursed.  
Allegations ensue that these investigated claims resulted in significant Government losses in the amount of at least $12 million dollars.  Applicant's Company 
A, himself and others are further alleged to have been indicted in November 1993 by a grand jury, after which he was arrested and released on bond.  The 
indictment allegedly charged defendants (including Applicant) with conspiracy to defraud the Government, four counts of major fraud against the Government, 
and 13 counts of false statements to the Government, all violations of Title 18 of the US Code.  Allegedly, a superceding indictment issued in April 1994, 
adding another count.  Allegedly, a plea agreement was entered into in June 1998, wherein Company A entered a guilty plea for violating one count of 18 
U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (false statements), a class C felony.  For its guilty plea, Company A was fined in the amount of $400,000.00, assessed a statutory penalty of 
$200.00, and required to reimburse the Government for its cost of litigation in the amount of $1.1 million, and pay the sum of $6,500,000.00 to settle other civil 
actions.  Applicant and the other named defendants in the indictment were allegedly dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Company A, Applicant and the other named defendants allegedly were suspended in December 1993 from doing business on Government 
contracts with the AF, following their indictment the previous month.  Allegedly, Applicant had his security clearance suspended in March 1994.  Alleged is the 
failure of Company A and the other defendants (inclusive of Applicant) to obtain a lifting of the Government contracting suspension from the AF, and their 
ensuing failure to obtain a preliminary injunction from a local federal court overturning the AF's doing business on government contracts suspension, with the 
AF obtaining a summary judgment in its favor in March 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Alleged  indictment-related civil complaints brought against Applicant, Company A and other officers of the company include one filed in July 1995 by the 
Government claiming Company A submissions of false claims on Navy and AF contracts and ensuing damages attributable to these false claims, and two other 
civil suits pending against him and/or Company A that had not been been resolved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, along with Company A and two other officers in the company's employ, were allegedly debarred by the AF in October 1998 from doing business on 
Government contracts for a period of five years: the period of debarment was retroactive (to December 1993) and thus expired in December 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged indictments of Company A and the named officers in 1993.  He admitted the AF's suspension of 
Company A and the four named officers from doing business on Government contracts with the former, and to having his own security clearance suspended in 
arch 1994.  He admitted a qui tam action (the G action) being filed against him and later dismissed with prejudice as to himself and the other defendants: 
exoneration he claims.  He admitted, too, to being debarred by the AF in October 1998.   And he admitted to two other actions being brought against Company 
A, himself and others (derivative litigations) by Company A shareholders but dismissed as to himself in May 1995 and to Company A and the other defendants 
in October 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied, however, engaging in conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations that could indicate that he could not properly safeguard classified information.  He denied </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any of the indictments or suits filed against him constituted evidence he could not be trusted to safeguard classified litigation.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In mitigation, Applicant claimed to have been an instrumental officer of Company A, who provided precision quartz and atomic timing systems for virtually all 
of the Country's satellites and  space probes, in addition to producing technology for an essential part of DoD's communication and satellite systems and 
basically guiding the Nation's satellites across unchartered oceans of space and home again.  He claims never to have been cited for not properly safeguarding 
classified information.  He disclaims any wrongdoing or responsibility for the Global Settlement Stipulation and cites to provisions in the Global Settlement 
that confirm the absence of any finding of wrongdoing by Applicant and the other dismissed defendants: a principal inducement for his accepting Company A's 
claimed cost-benefit rationale for buying Company A's peace with a plea agreement with the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and material factual findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Background of Applicant and Company A</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With considerable experience with public accounting firms and a major apparel company as a divisional comptroller, Applicant joined Company A as its 
secretary treasurer in 1979 (R.T., at 114-15).  As secretary of the company, Applicant was responsible for attending board meetings, preparing the corporate 
minutes, and maintaining the corporate minute books.  As treasurer, Applicant was responsible for all accounting functions of the company: payment of bills, 
collection of revenue, maintenance of  financial records, and preparation of financial reports for filing with the SEC and the banks (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 116).  
Applicant's sphere of responsibility did not include bids, work order preparations, labor time claims, or anything related to the administration of Company A's 
contracts and sub-contracts with the company's customers (R.T., at 121-24).  Such contract-related functions were the responsibility of the company's program 
manager (R.T., at 123-24), and Applicant rarely got involved in this side of the company's divisional separation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1988 through the present, Company A was principally devoted to the business of manufacturing certain electronic devices for end use by the US in its 
satellite and space exploration programs.  Company A was known as the principal supplier of precision quartz and atomic timing systems for US satellites and 
Government space probes.  Company A also produced key technology for  many military missile communications and satellite systems, including missile 
system clocks, for DoD.  During Applicant's tenure as Company A's secretary-treasurer, he was privy to his company's production of thousands of time and 
frequency control components and systems for use in missiles, satellites and deep space exploration, with many of the programs being classified.  Applicant 
estimates that during the late eighties, almost 90 per cent of Company A's output was connected with Government end use products: its sub-contract work 
involved both classified and special access programs with some of the country's preeminent prime defense contractors (<EM>see</EM> exs. R, S and T; R.T., at 118-20).  In 
recognition of  Company A's significant military and space contributions,  it has received over 50 awards and letters of recognition from its Government 
customers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>DoD's investigation of Company A overcharges on Sub-contracts with Company B</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following up on reports of Company A's overcharging of DoD on the former's numerous Government sub-contracts with Company B, three front-line 
investigative agencies (<EM>viz., </EM>Air force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and the FBI initiated a joint  
investigation in December 1989.  Investigation disclosed that Company A had overcharged DoD on the subcontracts Company A had with Company B, in 
addition to tendering defective pricing to DoD on several advanced missile contracts and certain standards contracts (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a part of the joint investigation, search warrants were issued covering all aspects of the terminated subcontracts at issue.  Contemporaneously with the 
issuance of these warrants, current and former interfacing employees of Company B and the other concerned prime contractors, in addition to sub-contract 
personnel of the other programs Company A was involved in, were interviewed by agents of the AF's inspector general.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A grand jury was impaneled in 1989 to investigate overcharges submitted by Company A and its officers (inclusive of Applicant) on its sub-contracts with 
Company B, as well as on its missile program and cesium standards contracts.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Returned indictments, suspensions  and suits against Company A and its officers</STRONG>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the result of the joint investigation, Company A and four of its principals were indicted on 18 counts, including major fraud claims.  When the indictment 
was issued, Government also filed a civil complaint requesting damages based on the acts contained in the indictment.  A superceding indictment was, in turn, 
filed in June 1994, which added a count to the original counts, which were incorporated anew.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The indictment and superceding indictment charged Company A, Applicant and other Company A officers, including its president and program manager, with 
one count of conspiracy to defraud the Government by obtaining the payment of false, fictitious and fraudulent claims, four counts of major fraud against the 
Government, and thirteen counts of false statements to the Government, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the issued indictments against Company A and the other defendants, the AF suspended (in December 1993) Company A and the other indicted 
officers/employees (Applicant included) from doing business on Government contracts (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).  In March 1994, Applicant's DoD security clearance was 
also suspended by the AF.  Several meetings and discussions ensued between the AF and Company A to see if an agreement could be reached to terminate the 
suspensions, but to no avail due to ongoing AF concerns (ex. 4).  Company A went to court to seek a preliminary injunction and declaratory relief re: the AF's 
suspension of the indicted defendants from doing business with the AF.  The district court, however, upheld the suspension, citing in a lengthy opinion the 
security needs of the AF in maintaining the suspension pending the outcome of the indictments (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  The district court granted summary judgment in the 
AF's favor in March 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Civil suits initiated against Company A and its officers/employees</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the criminal indictments were still pending, the Government filed (in July 1995) a civil complaint against Company A and other officers and employees 
of the company (Applicant included), claiming Company A, aided by the other named defendants, submitted false claims on Navy and AF contracts covering a 
classified missile program over a five-year period spanning 1988 to 1993.  According to the Government's complaint filed in November 1993, the defendants 
falsely stated production costs and submitted false claims and statements concerning Company A's estimated  costs (primarily labor costs) related to the 
manufacture and sale of electronic components and devices utilized in space satellites.  By submitting inflated estimated  costs instead in connection with its 
terminated sub-contracts, the complaint claimed Company A, aided by the other named defendants, not only falsified its estimated project costs, but impaired 
any meaningful negotiations between the company, the prime contractor and the AF over the amount of cost reimbursement Company A was reasonably 
entitled to.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other civil actions ensued against Company A, Applicant and other officers and employees of the company as an outgrowth of the criminal indictments.   Two 
<EM>qui tam</EM> actions were filed against Company A and certain of the company's officers alleging fraud under the false claims act and related theories by civil 
complainants M and G.  Only the G action named Applicant, however, as a defendant.  Filed in October 1993, this action specifically claimed that the named 
defendants (Applicant included) created and utilized false cost data in order to justify Company A's cost estimates on bid packages submitted to contractors, 
which inflated the prices and fees Company A charged for replacing parts in identified classified space programs (<EM>see</EM> ex. S-2).  This case was stayed by the 
federal district court presiding over the action in April 1997, pending resolution of the criminal matter affecting some of the named civil defendants (<EM>see</EM> ex. B). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides the G action, stockholders of Company A filed derivative actions against the company and its officers and directors (Applicant included) seeking 
money damages for misconduct arising out of the claimed actions in the criminal indictment of the same defendants in November 1993.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After receiving notice of the above civil complaints, Applicant and the other named defendants made claim for their defense and reimbursement if warranted 
under their D &amp; O insurance policies (<EM>see</EM> exs. R-1 and S-1).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The global settlement agreement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1998, Company A entered into a plea agreement with the Government: Under the plea agreement, Company A pleaded guilty to violating one count of 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (a class C felony).  Besides pleading guilty to a false claim count, Company A agreed to an order directing it to pay (a) a criminal fine in 
the amount of $400,000.00, plus a statutory assessment of $200.00, (b) payment of $1,100,000.00 in reimbursement of the cost of the Government's 
investigation, and  &copy;) payment of separate sums of $5,000,000.00 and $1,500,000.00 to settle other civil actions: the Government's own civil fraud action and 
the certain qui tam action (the G action), in which the Government had intervened in, for a total of $6,500,000.00 in civil settlement payments.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The global settlement agreement also provided for dismissal of the indictments against the other named defendants (Applicant included), but only after the 
terms and conditions imposed on Company A had been satisfied.  The global settlement made no effort to disturb the AF's suspension and debarment actions 
against Company A and the dismissed defendants. This being said, the settlement agreement contains no incriminating admissions or acknowledgments by any 
of the dismissed defendants, Applicant included.  The agreement  concludes by affirming that "nothing in this agreement nor any payment made pursuant hereto 
constitutes evidence of an admission of liability by any person or entity and shall not be construed to be an admission by any person or entity with respect to any 
issue of law or fact," save for what is covered with respect to Company A's guilty plea (<EM>see</EM> plea agreement in ex. 3).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following execution of the global agreement, the Government stipulated it had no intentions of instituting any other actions civil fraud actions against Company 
A (<EM>see</EM> ex. C). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Settlement of other civil complaints and reimbursement agreements</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After notifying the carriers of the pending criminal and civil claims against them, Applicant and his fellow directors and officers of Company A, along with 
Company A, provided their insurance companies copies of all of the relevant pleadings, documents and information relative to the pending litigation, along with 
their associated claims for reimbursement.  The seeking indemnities (Applicant included) filed reimbursement claims against their carriers (X and Y, 
respectively).  Amicable negotiations produced an overall settlement of filed claims against carrier X in November 1998, following the concluded global 
settlement with the Government and the other civil claims, that included full policy limits reimbursement from one carrier in the amount of $4.5 million for the 
coverage provided for the years spanning 1989 and 1990, and 1990 and 1991, respectively (<EM>see</EM> exs. 3, M-1/M2, and R-2). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Negotiations with carrier Y over Company A's reimbursement claims were more protracted, though, and did not produce  a settlement of the pending criminal 
and civil claims covering the two remaining years of coverage (spanning 1991 and 1993) until February 2001following initiated reimbursement suit against the 
carrier: this for $3 million for the covered 1991 to 1993 insured years (<EM>see</EM> exs. 3, M-1/M2 and S-2).  Each settlement (<EM>i.e., </EM>with both the X and Y carriers) was 
reciprocated by general releases and hold harmless commitments from each of the settling claimants (Applicant included) and dismissal of the suits against 
them.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Post-settlement debarment of Company A and individual officers</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because neither the global settlement agreement nor the district court's decision precluded the AF from initiating and maintaining debarment and suspensions 
(inclusive of security clearances) against Company A and its dismissed officers (inclusive of Applicant), the AF went forward with its debarment action, but 
limited its formal debarment to Company A only, while keeping its clearance suspensions in place for the duration of the debarment action.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1998, the AF debarred Company A and its four dismissed officers (inclusive of Applicant) from doing business on Government contracts for a 
period of five years (<EM>see</EM> ex. K).  The period of debarment credited the affected parties with the period of contract suspensions already completed.  As a result, 
the debarment order expired on December 12, 1998, as to all of the covered parties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Evidence affecting Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of the global settlement agreement itself contains no incriminating or exonerating language that can either detract or aid a trustworthiness 
showing.  Expressly contained in the agreement is a provision that none of the conditions or payments agreed to may be considered as evidence of guilt as to 
any of the defendants.  DoD was afforded access to the Justice Department's evidence under the terms and conditions of the plea agreement, and did make some 
use of the plea agreement in crafting its own internal investigation (<EM>see</EM> ex.3).  Inspector general reports produced as a part of Government's exhibit 3 provide 
really nothing incriminating as to Applicant or any of the other defendants, for that matter.  The inspector general's September 1998 report in fact goes so far as 
to confirm that "No management control deficiencies were identified during the course of this investigation" (ex. 3, at 79).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Afforded an opportunity in the global settlement agreement for allocution, Company A's successor CEO at the time (a retired military officer, Mr. C) described 
the history of the subcontracts at issue in the settled indictment claims.  Under the terms of Company A's subcontract with Company B (the prime contractor), 
Company A was entitled to compensation for hours worked by Company A employees on a covered classified project, plus a percentage added to that amount 
representing overhead and general administrative costs.  Mr. C went on to describe how Company A's program office submitted its reimbursement claims on a 
document referred to as "the form 1435" (ex. 3).   Acknowledging that Company A knowingly and wilfully falsified the number of labor hours and costs it 
estimated in the Form 1435, Mr. C affirmed also that the Form 1435 misstatements were material, because they deprived the Government and Company B 
auditors from properly reviewing and negotiating Company A's reimbursement claim (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 105).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, Mr. C elaborated on the inflated labor costs included in Company A's Form 1435 submission that was the subject of the indictments: Essentially, 
the classified contract specifically covered by the Form 1435 was one of many classified projects under sub-contract with Company B and the AF (<EM>compare </EM>exs. 
R, S and T).  In the form submission, the Company's contract division pro rated a disproportionate number of hours from other contracts as a best estimate 
allocation on what was considered by Company A to be a fixed contract (<EM>compare</EM> ex. V with R.T., at 103-05), and to this extent inflated the actual number of 
hours devoted to the project covered by the Form 1435 under scrutiny.  Because this mis-allocation hampered the auditing and negotiating abilities of the AF 
and Company A with respect to Company A's claims, it constituted a fraud on the Government (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 103-05), to which the company pleaded guilty and 
stands by.  Still, there is nothing in Mr.C's allocution that could be considered incriminating in any way to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While insufficient to avert inferences of fraud attributable to its filing of false claims, a post-indictment independent engineering audit performed by a 
credentialed outside program manager affiliated with a prominent defense contractor validated the Government received full value on the impacted contracts 
covered by the indictment (<EM>see</EM> exs. V and W).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Joined by Mr. W (a long time employee of Company A with knowledge of Applicant's business practices with the company), Mr.C strongly vouchsafes for 
Applicant's trustworthiness and reliability, while assuring that his company's internal investigation produced no evidence of any Applicant complicity or 
knowledge of the covered overcharge claims submitted by Company A (<EM>compare </EM>ex. P; R.T., at 95-96).   Mr.C joined Company A in 1990 following a 
distinguished military career, and a brief period of business consulting  overseas after his military retirement in 1987 (R.T., at 83-86).  After becoming a 
member of Company A's board, he soon learned of the ongoing criminal investigation into Company A's claims submissions.  Relying in part on his own 
military experience, he and others on the Board formed an oversight committee to look at the internal and outside audits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finding no obvious irregularities in the company's unqualified outside audits (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 117-18), Mr. C and his board turned to undertaking a review of the 
Company's ethics training with a view to improving the way they present and document their programs with the AF (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 92).   With the formed 
investigative committee, the company also engaged a credentialed outside program specialist affiliated with a prominent defense contractor to undertake an 
independent engineering audit.  The audit validated the company's claims the Government received full value on the sub-contracts covered by the indictment 
(<EM>see</EM> exs. V and W). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the indictments were returned in November 1993 and Company A's chief executive officer and Applicant took leaves of absence from their executive 
duties with the company (documented by the minutes of the company's convened December 1993 special board meeting), Mr. C accepted Company A's 
chairmanship (<EM>see</EM> ex. T).  And for the next several years, he devoted his energies to navigating the company's suspensions and debarments, while at the same 
tome steadying its commercial business side.  By all accounts, his efforts have been successful in rehabilitating Company A (both with its Government contract 
business and its commercial efforts).  He added that he has since returned Applicant to his former post as secretary of the company with direct reporting 
responsibilities to him (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 94-95).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Mr. C's post-indictment stewardship, some structural changes were made in Company A's engineering division, but none in its financial division 
previously administered by Applicant (R.T., at 98-99).   Basically, he (relying in part on the reported clean audits of his company's outside auditors who audited 
the years in issue) found no glitches or compiling and reporting deficiencies  in the way the company's inside and outside financial data was assembled and 
reported out (both internally and externally) by the financial division headed by Applicant (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 99-100).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's personal life has been marked by praiseworthy achievements that bear positively on his overall honesty and trustworthiness.  He is credited with 
being a valued member of his temple for many years where he has been responsible for supervising all aspects of the temple's finances and other significant 
matters relating to the temple's business affairs.  By all accounts, he has tended to his assigned responsibilities in a conscientious and reliable manner and draws 
rich praise for his volunteer efforts in behalf of his temple.   Trustworthy endorsements of Applicant come from several end use Government customers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Company A's demonstrated rehabilitation</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Company A continued to receive waivers from the AF following its 1993 indictment to continue to produce critical components on classified projects in 
subcontractor roles with the DoD's certified general contractors (<EM>see</EM> ex. D).  The company has continued to provide work for DoD and the Country's space 
programs on classified projects since its contract suspension was lifted in 1998 and by all accounts is well regarded in both its classified work with the 
Government and its non-classified commercial operations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1 Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 6 Associations with persons involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the 
Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual 
inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a long and meritorious record of contribution to his defense contractor (a major contributor to the Nation's missile 
and satellite programs), but with alleged involvement with his defense contractor in  overcharging the Government in a series of cost estimates submitted for 
reimbursement. While the extensive allegations contained in the SOR address Applicant' involvement in criminal indictment and civil fraud claims, they are 
framed in personal conduct theory covered by Guideline E, and do not, as such, incorporate the criminal guidelines of Guideline J.  The SOR in this case 
alleged no actual or constructive knowledge by Applicant of any of the underlying conduct subject to the various indicted offenses and related civil law suits 
and suspension actions, and no suggested application of criminal conduct to any of the covered actions.  Government's allegations were not only pursued 
exclusively in personal conduct theory, but were reaffirmed by Department Counsel in closing summation.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, security concerns are raised about Applicant's association with his employer (Company A) who pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false statement in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001,  who was (along with Applicant) suspended from doing business on Government contracts for a five-year period spanning 
1993 and 1998, and was formally debarred (Company A only) in addition to being named in several related suits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Corporate liability for the criminal and civil actions of individual officers, employees and agents found to have been committed while exercising authorized 
powers in its behalf is entrenched in American jurisprudence and where applicable requires no proof that the officer, employee or agent was expressly 
authorized by the corporation to act.  <EM>Cf. New York C &amp; H R.R. Co. v. United States, </EM>212 U.S. 481 (1908); <EM>United States v. Richmond, </EM>700 F.2d 1183, 1195n.9 
(8<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1983); <EM>United States v. Cincinatti, </EM>689 F.2d 238, 241-42 (lst Cir. 1982); <EM>United States v. Dye Const. Co., </EM>510 F.2d 78, 82 (10<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1975).  Conversely, 
criminal misconduct affixed to the corporation may be imputed to individual officers, employees and agents, provided they can be shown to have participated 
in, knew of , or had reason to know of the misconduct.  <EM>Cf. Harkin v. Brundage, </EM>276 U.S. 36, 52 (1928).  These principles of corporate imputation provide the 
cornerstone of the AF's contract procurement and administration regulations (<EM>see </EM>FAR 9.407-5(a); FAR 9.406-5(a); FAR 9.407-2 &copy;).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For any attribution of involvement or material knowledge of corporate criminal wrongdoing to be made to a high ranking corporate officer, the evidence at the 
very minimum must be sufficient to attribute enough actual or constructive knowledge to the subject officer to justify his taking corrective steps himself, 
alerting others in his chain of command, or failing either, to promptly disassociate himself from the corporate organization.  Neither strict liability nor rebuttable 
presumption finds any place in accepted principles of corporate responsibility and accountability: criminally or civilly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That Applicant in the present case was neither convicted, debarred,  nor found civilly liable or accountable for any wrongdoing arising out of Company A's 
pleaded wrongs covered by the global settlement is, for sure, not dispositive of his own claimed innocence.  Nothing in either the global settlement agreement 
or any of the other underlying documentation prevented  the AF or DoD from pursuing suspension against Applicant for any found individual wrongdoing 
arising out of his associations with Company A and the conduct ascribed to the latter.  But this takes evidence of attributable wrongdoing, which neither the 
AF's inspector general nor the Government can document in this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only probative facts relating to any Applicant involvement or culpable knowledge of the misconduct covered by the indictments, suits and AF suspension 
actions are limited to the AF's findings relative to its preliminary suspensions in December 1993.  These preliminary findings are predicated on charges and 
allegations covered in the indictments and civil suits filed, which the AF reviewed, and not on the basis of any independent witness accounts or documents that 
can be culled and gleaned from the record. These preliminary findings were, in turn, superceded in part by the global settlement later consummated between the 
parties.  True, the AF's entitlement to proceed with suspensions and debarment were not affected by the global settlement, but these actions were lifted in 
December 1998 (suspension only as to Applicant) free of any lingering issues, and with credit extended for the past time served under the suspensions.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither the AF's inspector general report nor the produced outside audits of Company A covering the five-year period spanning 1989-1994 make reference to 
any individual wrongdoing by either Company A or Applicant.  Because, however, Company A did plead guilty to one felony count of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 as 
the result of its submission of a Form 1435 to the Government and the prime contractor containing false statements relative to its estimated costs incurred on 
the covered classified project, Government may invoke two of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct: DC 1 (reliable 
unfavorable information) and DC 6 (association with persons involved with criminal activity).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has consistently denied any individual wrongdoing associated with his activities with Company A.  He draws considerable corroboration of his 
assurances, not only from the absence of probative evidence to the contrary, but by a rich confluence of corroborative evidence supporting his own assurances: 
influential vouchsafing of trust by not only Mr. C who supervised his own internal investigation after assuming the reins of Company A in the wake of  the 
indictments, but by a Company A manager (Mr. W) who interfaced  with Applicant at all relevant times; indemnity of settlement sums paid to the settling civil 
complainants by the D &amp; O insurance carriers covering Company A and its directors and officers (unlikely were any knowing and wilful wrongdoing by the 
covered directors and officers found), the absence of any noted individual wrongdoing by Applicant or any of his fellow officers in the produced outside audits 
covering the five-year period spanning 1989-1994, the AF's finding of no management deficiencies in its inspector general's report, and the Government's 
resumed contracting with Company A following the AF's lifting of its suspension bar against the contractor in 1998.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Company A, moreover, has been credibly shown to have rehabilitated itself with the aid of ethics training oversight and engineering restructuring, regained its 
role as a contractor doing business with the Government, and experienced no repeat of conduct that could be characterized as either of a criminal or unethical 
nature.  Applicant not only refutes any Government concerns of  his being involved in any culpable conduct in connection with his Company A duties, but he 
has manifestly avoided any tangible misconduct of any kind.  As a rehabilitated corporate entity, Company A can no longer be considered as a person associated 
with criminal activity, and Applicant may rightfully take full advantage of two of the mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct 
(MC): MC 1 (information not substantiated or pertinent to trustworthiness assessment) and MC 7 (association with persons involved in criminal activity has 
ceased).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant carries his evidentiary burden in establishing his security eligibility.  He not only refutes the Government's 
security-related concerns of his involvement or material knowledge of any criminal conduct involving Company A that could raise judgment and trust questions 
about himself, but he mitigates security concerns associated with his employment as a high level officer with Company A during the period of Company A's 
admitted false statements.  Favorable conclusions warrant, accordingly,  with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.e of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
