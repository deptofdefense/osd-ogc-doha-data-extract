<P>Applicant's financial irresponsibility was not mitigated where his debts were caused, in part, by his own irresponsibility in not having sufficient capital for his 
business start-up and using personal credit cards for business expenses, and where he had taken no effective action to address his personal indebtedness, despite 
having positive cash flow. The one debt he was paying was precipitated by a judgment garnishment of his bank account. Applicant's falsification of his 
financial history suggested he could not be relied upon to state the truth if the truth presented potential adverse consequences to his personal interest. Clearance 
denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 28 June 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-12749.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 15 July 
2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 18 September 2002, and received by me on 23 September 2002. 
On 2 October 2002, I issued a notice of hearing for 21 October 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented six exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses;  Applicant presented three exhibits--admitted without 
objection--and the testimony of two witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 29 October 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant amended his Answer to subparagraphs 1.a.-d. to admit those allegations (Tr. 11). Applicant had previously denied those allegations 
on the ground that he had to conduct further investigation of the alleged debts. I granted the amendment (Tr. 12).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraph 1.e., and paragraphs 2. and 3. Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of 
fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 59-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He received an M.B.A. degree from a major university in 
1972 (G.E. 1, Tr. 60); since that time he has been employed in various positions in the business world (Tr. 60).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 13 November 2001, Applicant falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Position (QNSP)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) by answering "no" to two questions requiring 
Applicant to disclose any accounts 180 days past due in the last seven years (question 28a) or currently 90 days past due (question 28b). In fact, he failed to 
disclose five past due debts totaling over $26,000.00.<A HREF="02-12749.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He was also alleged to have falsified his QNSP by answering "no" to two questions requiring Applicant 
to disclose any unpaid judgment in the last seven years (question 27d) or any civil actions in the last seven year (question 29). However, while credit bureau 
reports (G.E. 2, A.E. A) reflect that the judgment alleged in subparagraph 1.f. was recorded in April 2001, the record does not reflect that Applicant was aware 
of the judgment before March 2002, when the judgment creditor obtained a garnishment of Applicant's bank account (A.E. C, Tr. 26, 36).<A HREF="02-12749.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consistently denied any intent to falsify his QNSP by omitting his past due debts.  However, he has provided conflicting explanations for his 
omissions. In his sworn statement (G.E. 3), he stated that the accounts were several years old and he did not have the details of the accounts  (names, numbers, 
and amounts owed). Further, he knew the mortgage account (that belonged to his ex-spouse) was still on his credit report, because he had tried unsuccessfully to 
have it removed. At the hearing, Applicant variously claimed he was in a hurry when he completed the QNSP (Tr. 30), or that he thought the debts went away 
when the creditor charged off the accounts (Tr. 41, 47-48, 59). Nevertheless, Applicant was aware that the Government was concerned about his finances (Tr. 
55-56), and had received dunning notices from his creditors when he could not pay his accounts (Tr. 46-48).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Setting aside the mortgage that I conclude was not Applicant's, the SOR alleges Applicant's four delinquent credit accounts totaling over $15,000.00, charged 
off in January 1997 (1.b.), March 1997 (1.a., 1.c.) and August 1999 (1.d.). The SOR also alleges an April 2001 judgment against Applicant for over $11,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant first became aware of the judgement in early 2002, when he received a garnishment notice from his bank (Tr. 26, 36, 39; A.E. C.). He believes the 
judgment creditor is a successor-in-interest on another account, but does not recall the original creditor (Tr. 44). Applicant reached a repayment agreement with 
the creditor in March 2002 (G.E. 5), providing six post-dated checks to be credited to the account as dated. In September 2002, Applicant provided another six 
post-dated checks (A.E. B; Tr. 27, 37-39). Nevertheless, a balance of approximately $3,500.00 remains (Tr. 29, 53).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has taken no steps to address the four past due accounts which have not been taken to judgment (Tr. 50-53), despite the fact that his Personal 
Financial Statement (G.E. 4) reflects a positive cash flow that continues (Tr. 53-54). He has considered a debt consolidation loan, but has taken no steps to 
implement that plan (Tr. 42).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributed his financial problems to using his personal credit cards to finance his start-up business in 1996 (Tr. 40, 44-46). He got behind and was 
unable to keep up the payments. However, he has not addressed his personal debt despite the fact that the business has started doing better (Tr. 32).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The record contains no evidence of Applicant's work performance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence establishes Applicant's history of indebtedness and his current failure to 
address that indebtedness despite having the means to do so. While circumstances beyond his control may have contributed to the original 
indebtedness--although a slow start to a new company seems fairly foreseeable--his current financial difficulties are due largely to his inadequate handling of 
his finances. He is not paying on any of the charged off credit card accounts. The one debt being paid, the judgment account, cannot be said to represent a good-faith effort to pay the account as Applicant took steps to address the account only when his bank account was garnished.<A HREF="02-12749.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. 
His belated--and incomplete--efforts to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve his debts does not constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of the 
Directive. I find Guideline F. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant knew he had past due accounts going back many years, and failed to disclose them. His 
claim that he thought the accounts had gone away is incredible given his educational background and business experience. Further, the record reflects that 
Applicant was aware of his past due accounts at the time he completed his clearance application, even if he did not have ready access to the details of the 
accounts. The omissions had the potential to influence the course of the background investigation. I find Guideline E. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's criminal conduct is recent. I find Guideline J. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant was also alleged to have omitted the mortgage debt at subparagraph 1.e., but I accept his testimony (Tr. 24-25, 32-36)--corroborated by his ex-spouse (Tr. 64-70), his sworn statement (G.E. 3), and the 3 May 1990 quit claim deed (G.E. 6)--that Applicant's ex-spouse was solely responsible for this 
account.
