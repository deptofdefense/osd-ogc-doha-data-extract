<P>The Applicant has renounced his Israeli and Mexican citizenship, and surrendered his Israeli and Mexican passports in compliance with the <EM>Money 
emorandum</EM> ("Guide to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of Foreign Preference Adjudication Guidelines," dated 
September 1, 2000).  His mother, sister and in-laws are citizens of and reside in Mexico.  His 77 year old mother was a housewife.  He manages her extensive 
portfolio, which is nearly all in American assets.  He has little contact with his sister and in-laws.  The Applicant was employed in Israel at an Israeli university 
while a graduate student, and was employed by an Israeli defense contractor, working on a joint effort with the U.S. Navy.  He served four months in the Israeli 
military before becoming a U.S. citizen.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 20, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 10, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 19, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 26, 2005, and the case was heard on October 
7, 2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The 
transcript (TR) was received on October 18, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence 
militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations, except subparagraphs 1.a. and 
1.c., in that he denies exercising his Mexican citizenship and using his Mexican passport since becoming a U.S. citizen.  He also denies subparagraph 1.d., in 
that he denies exercising his Israeli citizenship.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">45 years of age, has a 
Ph.D., and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant's father was in a Nazi "extermination camp" at the end of the Second World War (TR at page 52 lines 14~24).  His family fled to Mexico, where 
the Applicant was born (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1).  Once the Applicant received an undergraduate degree in Mexico, he went to Israel to further 
his education at the age of 23 (TR at page 19 line 21 to page 21 line 1, and at page 49 line 24 to page 50 line 12).  After receiving a Master's Degree in Israel, he 
came to the U.S. to pursue a Ph.D. (TR at page 26 line 22 to page 28 line 4, and at page 49 line 24 to page 50 line 12).  He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 
July of 2001 (Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) J).</P> 
<P>1.a.~1.f.  The Applicant has renounced both his Israeli and Mexican citizenship (TR at page 13 line 12 to page 14 line 14, at page 25 line 9 to page 26 line 17, 
and AppX W).  He has also surrendered his Israeli and Mexican passports in compliance with the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM> (TR at page 47 line 3 to page 48 line 8, 
at page 49 lines 9~16, at page 55 line 21 to page 56 line 22, GX 11, and AppXs K and L).  The Applicant served a total of four months in the Israeli military, 
during the first half of 1989, before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001 (TR at page 33 line 9 to page 34 line 20).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
<P>2.a.~2.h.  The Applicant's mother, sister and in-laws are citizens of and reside in Mexico (TR at page 37 lines 2~15, at page 40 line 22 to page 41 line 24, at 
page 42 lines 5~23, at page 43 line 24 to page 44 line 14 and at page 58 line 21 to page 59 line 10).  His 77 year old mother was a housewife (TR at page 40 line 
22 to page 41 line 24).  He manages her extensive portfolio, which is nearly all in American assets (TR at page 37 line 16 to page 40 line 5, and at page 57 line 
13 to page 58 line 20).  The Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is $600,000~$700,000 (TR at page 44 line 21 to page 47 line 2, and AppXs A~G).  The Applicant 
has little contact with his sister and in-laws (TR at page 42 lines 5~23, and at page 58 line 21 to page 59 line 10).  None of the Applicant's foreign relatives 
have any connection with any foreign government.</P> 
<P>The Applicant was employed in Israel at an Israeli university while a graduate student (TR at page 23 line 21 to page 24 line 2).  He was also employed by an 
Israeli defense contractor, working on a joint effort with the U.S. Navy (TR at page 24 line 3 to page 25 line 4, at page 26 lines 18~22, and at page 62 line 5 to 
page 63 line 4).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
<P>Those who supervise and/or work with the Applicant think most highly of him, and would recommend the Applicant to a position of trust (AppXs O~Q).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to a Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that 
are harmful to the interests </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and 
regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was a tri-national with Israel and Mexico, and until recently maintained both Israeli and Mexican passports.  The first and second disqualifying 
conditions under Foreign Preference are therefore applicable as there was an "exercise of dual citizenship," with the "possession . . . of a foreign passport."  
This is countered, however, by his compliance with both the last mitigating condition, when he renounced his Israeli and Mexican citizenship; and by his 
compliance with the <EM>Money Memorandum,</EM> when he surrendered his Israeli and Mexican passports.  The Applicant also served in the Israeli army in 1989.  The 
third disqualifying condition is therefore also applicable, "[m]ilitary service . . . for a foreign country."  However, the second mitigating condition is applicable 
here, as this indicator "of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship."  Mitigation is shown.  
Guideline C is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's </SPAN>mother, sister and in-laws are citizens of and reside in Mexico<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence is therefore 
applicable as "[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  However, the Applicant's foreign relatives not 
connected with any government, and there is no evidence that thier presence in Mexico can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it 
would be unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such attempt at exploitation (TR at page 51 line 10 to page 52 line 3).  The first mitigating 
condition is therefore applicable as "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States."  Mitigation is again shown.  Guideline B is also found for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security
