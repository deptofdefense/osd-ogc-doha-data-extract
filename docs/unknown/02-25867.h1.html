<P>Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption has resulted in criminal  alcohol-related incidents, involving  Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and inappropriate 
sexual conduct, occurring from  1979 to 1996. Applicant's consumption of alcohol has been reduced significantly.  Evidence of Applicant's alcohol reform is 
sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On April 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement, dated June 10, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (Exhibit 3). He requested that his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On September 12, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant filed no response to the FORM. The case was assigned to initially assigned to another Administrative Judge on November 4, 2003, but it was then 
reassigned to  this Administrative Judge on April 26, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-8), which have been admitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary 
evidence into the record. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guidelines D, G, and J of the Directive. The SOR contains two allegations 1. a and 1.b., under Guideline D (Sexual 
Conduct), eight allegations, 2.a. through 2.h., under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and five allegations, 3.a. through 3.e. under Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant admits allegations 2.d., 2.e.,  and 2.h., and he denies the other allegations.  The admitted allegations are incorporated as Findings of Fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the FORM, Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the other admitted documents, 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 41 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and  he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">has engaged in sexual conduct that has involved criminal 
behavior and poor judgement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In May 1997, Applicant was found guilty of violating Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and he received the non-judicial 
punishment by the United States Navy of a reduction in rank, and 45 days of extra duty for an incident of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in December 
1996. The evidence indicates that another male individual accused Applicant of committing unwanted and inappropriate sexual conduct toward him (Exhibits 3, 
5, 7, and 8). Applicant does not seem to contradict that a sexual incident occurred, but he contends, in his Response to the SOR (RSOR), that it was consensual 
(Exhibit 3). The specific facts of the case were resolved while Applicant was in the Navy, and they will not be litigated again in this venue. However, there is no 
disputing that he accepted the punishment described above. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In March 1990, Applicant was accused of sexually assaulting another service member on a Naval Base. He was ultimately charged with Sodomy; 
Homosexuality. In this incident, a male individual also accused Applicant of committing unwanted and inappropriate sexual conduct toward him. In his RSOR, 
Applicant denies that a sexual incident occurred (Exhibit 3). An investigation was conducted by the U.S. Naval Investigative Service (Exhibit4), but no 
conclusion was reached and no further legal action was taken. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> In both of the two incidents that are described above, and that occurred in 1996 and 1990, Applicant had consumed a significant amount of alcohol, and based 
on the evidence, I conclude that it is highly likely that alcohol was a contributing factor in their occurrence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's drinking has resulted in three additional alcohol related incidents, where he was arrested and found or pled guilty to Driving Under the Influence 
(DUI) or some other alcohol related action. They occurred  in 1984, 1983, and 1979.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1984, Applicant was arrested and found guilty of Driving While Intoxicated. He was  required to pay a fine, ordered to perform community service, and 
attend one year of  meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (Exhibits 3 and 8). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1983, Applicant was arrested for DUI. Applicant denies that he was driving the vehicle, but claims that he changed places with the driver, so that the driver 
could avoid legal responsibility (Exhibit 3). Ultimately, Applicant  plead guilty to the reduced charge of Reckless Operation of a Vehicle.   He was  required to 
pay a $90 fine (Exhibits 3 and 8). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1979, Applicant was arrested for Minor in Possession of Alcohol. He was a passenger in a vehicle with other underage youths, in which alcohol was present 
(Exhibit 3). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1992, Applicant was ordered to attend an alcohol education seminar by the U. S. Navy. Consumption of alcohol on the previous night contributed to his  
returning late to his duty station, which warranted the order (Exhibit 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant enrolled in a treatment for his alcohol consumption at a Veterans facility after a request from DOHA to obtain  an evaluation of his medical condition 
regarding alcohol consumption</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 3). No evidence was introduced regarding that treatment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In a statement made to a Defense Security Agent on March 8, 2002, Applicant stated that he now consumes two beers on an average of three times a month 
(Exhibit 8).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. Applicant's conduct that occurred 
in 1996, 1990, 1984, 1983, and 1979, and which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.a., 1.b., 2.d., 2.e., and 2.f., respectively, is included  in this paragraph as 
criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Since this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to the contents of the various documents that are found in the case file.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline D - Sexual Behavior) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline D (Sexual 
Behavior)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Regarding Guideline D, Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A4.1.2.1.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> applies because Applicant's conduct was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">sexual behavior of a criminal nature, for some 
of which Applicant was given an Article 15.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> (E2.A7.1.2.4.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> applies because the type of sexual behavior exhibited by Applicant reflects a lack of judgment 
and a failure to exercise sound discretion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Regarding the Mitigating Conditions (MCs), I rule that MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A4.1.3.2.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> applies because Applicant's conduct that occurred in 1990 and 1996 is not recent, 
and there has been no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature.   The finding is for Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant on the other 
hand has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in 
alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, which is DC (E2.A7.1.2.1.). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It has also been established </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">by substantial evidence 
that Applicant  has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, which is which is DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">However, I have concluded that Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A7.1.3.2.) applies because the problem occurred a number of years ago, the last related alcohol 
related arrest occurred in 1996, and there has been no indication of a recent problem.  While Applicant continues to consume alcohol, he has greatly reduced the 
amount of alcohol that he consumes. Paragraph 2 is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">criminal conduct from in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1979 to 1996</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, as h</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e was arrested for, and 
convicted of, DUI and other alcohol related criminal offenses</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. DC (E2.A10.1.2.1.), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged, and DC (E2.A10.1.2.2), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, apply in this case. I find that MC (E2.A10.1.3.1) 
applies, because the criminal behavior, which was caused in large part by alcohol consumption, was not recent. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior (Guideline 
D), has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G) and that he has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J). Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that the conduct was not recent and he is not likely to engage in any such conduct in the future, which is 
sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him. Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
