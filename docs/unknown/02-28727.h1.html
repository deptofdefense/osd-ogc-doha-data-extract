<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 3 June 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-28727.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommending denial or revocation of 
Applicant's clearance.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision without a hearing on 8 July 2003 and 1 December 2003. She did 
not respond to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 15 April 2004; the record in this case closed 2 June 2004, the day her response was 
due. The case was assigned to me on 8 June 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for the debt at subparagraph 1.g. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. She has not previously had a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties and irresponsibility dating back to 1995. She has 11 delinquent credit accounts totaling over $15,000.00, that fell 
past due between November 1995 and July 2001. None of these debts were caused by circumstances beyond Applicant's control. Applicant admits 10 debts 
totaling over $7,000.00; she denies a debt of nearly $8000.00 because the state statute of limitations for bringing suit on the debt has expired. However, 
Applicant admits she co-signed an automobile note for her sister. The car was later repossessed when her brother-in-law failed to make the payments, leaving 
Applicant with a deficiency balance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to co-signing the automobile note for her sister and being sole obligor on a loan used to purchase a satellite dish for 
her brother in 1995. When she experienced some medical expenses, she fell behind in her payments on the two notes and on the medical expenses as well. She 
filed a chapter 13 wage-earner bankruptcy plan in August 1997 listing a total of over $23,000.00 in secured and unsecured debt that she was to repay at the rate 
of $50.00 per week over 52 months. The plan was dismissed in June 1999 for failure to make the required payments. She had paid approximately 25% of the 
required amount at the time the plan was dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answer demonstrated that she had entered into debt counseling in July 2003 to  repay seven of the debts alleged in the SOR, but also to address 
three new debts totaling over $4,500.00. However, there is no evidence that she has begun the payment plan proposed by the credit counselor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment. . . divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to an 
applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record demonstrates Applicant's substantial indebtedness, acquired largely through her own 
irresponsibility, and largely ignored since the dismissal of her chapter 13 plan in June 1999. She sought credit counseling in July 2003--apparently in response 
to the SOR--but there is no evidence that she has begun any repayment plan suggested by the credit counselor. Further, the counseling record includes three 
new debts totaling over $4,500.00. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. 
They do not appear to be due to circumstances beyond her control. It does not appear that Applicant has stopped digging herself into a financial hole, much less 
started to pull herself out of it. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
