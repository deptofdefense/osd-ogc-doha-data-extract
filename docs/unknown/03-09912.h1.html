<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence.  His mother, a citizen of the U.S. and Israel, now lives in the U.S.   While his sibling and niece in 
Israel are dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel and reside in Israel, Applicant has limited contact with them.  Based on regular security briefings, Applicant 
assures he would contact his security officials if any pressure were attempted.  Given his long history of responsible conduct at work, all his supervisors and the 
military site manager highly recommend Applicant continue to maintain the security clearance he has held since 1985 without any infractions.  Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-09912.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to the Applicant on October 6, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.  The SOR alleges specific 
concerns over foreign influence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1. Applicant replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 20, 2004; also, he 
advised he was represented by counsel and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>After Department Counsel stated the case was ready to proceed in February 15, 2005, the case was assigned to me on February 17, 2005.  On April 19, 2005, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on May 9, 2005, in a city near where Applicant lives and works. At the hearing the government 
presented five exhibits (Exhibits1-5) which were admitted into evidence without objection.  Department Counsel's request that administrative notice be taken of 
the information contained in Exhibits I - VI was granted; Applicant's counsel did not object to AN I, II, III, IV, and VI.  He did object to AN V, but I overrule 
his objection.  (AN I-VI; TR 15-22)</P> 
<P>Applicant's counsel offered one exhibit for administrative notice (AN VII) that was accepted  without objection; he called Applicant and five other individuals 
as witnesses.  The transcript (TR) was received on May 19, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of 
Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 44 years old, has worked for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 since March1985.  Applicant initially was granted a Secret clearance in 
February 1986 after he completed a Personnel Security Questionnaire in March 1985.  In January 2001 he completed a Security Clearance Application 
(Standard Form 86).  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 4; TR 99-103)  He regularly participates in training on security-related issues. (TR 103)</P> 
<P>Since Applicant was born in Israel of an American father, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1973.  Applicant and his wife married in 
1995.  They have two children born in 1996 and 1998.  (Exhibit 1; TR 107)  He and his wife separated in 2001 and were divorced in February 2002.  He and his 
wife have joint legal custody of the children.  (Answer; TR 139)</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Influence</STRONG> </CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's mother and father met in Israel when they were visiting there after World War II.  Born in Belgium, his mother was orphaned in World War II when 
both her parents were killed in the war.  Born in the U.S., his father was a U.S. Navy veteran from World War II.  They married and had two sons in Israel, but 
the family moved to the U.S. in 1962.  (TR 104-105) </P> 
<P>Since September 1962 Applicant has continuously lived in the U.S. and never returned to Israel.  (Exhibits 1, 4; TR 104, 112)  In 1985 he disclosed in his 
Personnel Security Questionnaire that he was born in Israel, that both his parents lived in the U.S., and that his mother was born in Belgium.  He was 
interviewed about his background as part of a security investigation in 1985, but the Statement reflects no questions were raised about his ties to Israel.  
(Exhibits 4, 5)   In his 2000 Security Clearance Application (SF 86), he disclosed his mother and brother lived in Israel.  He provided additional details about 
his relatives in answer to two sets of Interrogatories submitted to DOHA.</P> 
<P>Applicant's mother is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. who currently resides in the U.S. in Applicant's home.   His mother and father had a small business in 
the U.S. for 26 years.  Her only communications with the government of Israel was contacting the consulate to get information to visit Israel to see her other son 
and his family who lived there.  She renewed her Israeli passport to enter Israel to visit her son who lives in Israel. After her husband died, she resided in Israel 
from 1998 until 2002 when she returned to the U.S.  She paid U.S. taxes while she lived in Israel.  Her last visit to Israel was in October 2004. She has no 
financial interests in Israel.  (SOR 1.a.)  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3; TR 106, 110-112; 130-135, 137)</P> 
<P>Applicant's brother who is 48 is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S.  Since 1998 he has resided in Israel and works for a privately held corporation as a sales 
manager.  From 1998 to 2001 Applicant had no contact with his brother.  That changed after Applicant's divorce.  In 2004 he reported he contacts his brother 
four times a month by phone or e-mail; he characterizes the relationship as his having only casual and infrequent contacts with his brother to discuss family 
business.  In 2005 he spoke with his brother three or for times.  He last saw his brother in 2004 for a brief lunch when his brother visited the U.S.  Applicant 
attests that his brother has never been contacted, requested or threatened by anyone from the state of Israel.  He does not know what financial interests his 
brother has in Israel. As the brother served four years in the U.S. military, Applicant credibly maintains his brother "has never and would never try to influence, 
coerce or threaten" Applicant to be disloyal to the oath he took when he was given his security clearance.  (SOR 1.b.) (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; TR 106-110, 123-130, 136)</P> 
<P>Applicant maintains contact with his brother over family matters.  His brother does not try to influence his voting or financial decisions.  (SOR 1.c.) (Answer)</P> 
<P>Applicant's niece is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. who currently resides in Israel and is a member of the Israel military as military service is mandatory in 
Israel.  She has one more year to serve.  When she finishes her service, she will attend college as her older sister does.  Applicant no longer has direct contact 
with his nieces.  In June 2004 Applicant reported he contacted his niece who serves in the Israeli Army two times a month by e-mail.  Applicant considers it 
unlikely that the Israel government would pressure a private in the Israeli army to try to access information.  He has never had any conversation with this niece 
about her military service or his job.  (SOR 1.d.) (Answer; Exhibit 2; TR 113-116, 123; 127-128; 135)</P> 
<P>Applicant has had a security clearance for 19 years and has never had one incident or mark on his security clearance record.  He would promptly report any and 
all contacts from any foreign or domestic person that wished to learn anything that he might know or any information that he might be able to obtain.  He took 
an oath in 1985 to protect the classified information that he has access to and takes that oath serious.  He would never jeopardize the U.S., his family, his career, 
or his beliefs for any person or group.  His security training courses have informed him to notify security personnel if he were ever contacted by someone from a 
foreign government.  (Answer; TR 103-104; 117-119)</P> 
<P>Applicant explained that his corporation has a "partnership relationship" with the State of Israel.  He noted that Congress has approved multiple military 
programs where the U.S. and Israel work together.  (TR 120-123; AN VII)</P> 
<P>Israel is one of the most active collectors of economic espionage.  (AN V at 15)  However, given Applicant's extensive ties to the U.S., I conclude it is unlikely 
he would succumb if any of these relatives were pressured by  the government in Israel.  He credibly established that if someone were pressuring his family, he 
would not "surrender to that kind of pressure. . . ."  Applicant established he would choose his loyalty to the United States over loyalty to his mother, his 
sibling, or his niece in Israel.  </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>A commander (CDR) who is currently in the military testified he has been the officer in charge of the site where Applicant works for two and a half years.  The 
CDR has almost daily, personal contact with him and has been Applicant's supervisor for the entire period.  As it is a government-owned/contractor-operated 
facility, the military and the contractor have a partnership for day-to-day operations at the site.  Because the CRD is in charge of the site, the CDR decides 
whether or not to grant access to the building for both military and contractor personnel.  Applicant currently has a security clearance which he needs to  
implement changes in the system.  He reported that Applicant's reputation at the site is as a "very hard worker."  Applicant is often "overwhelmed, but is very 
conscientious, very detailed, very concerned that the work he's doing is done on time. So, very trustworthy."  He assesses Applicant as loyal and reliable.  He 
has never questioned Applicant's handling of security-sensitive information or materials.  The commander is aware that Applicant's mother lives with 
Applicant.  When he learned that Applicant had family in Israel, including a niece in the Israeli military, that information caused CDR no concern over 
Applicant's trustworthiness or reliability.  If he had any doubts, CDR could have Applicant removed from the facility.  The CDR  believed that Applicant would 
never succumb to pressure from the Israeli military.  Indeed, Applicant, like other employees in the facility, takes security compliance training every six months 
or annually.  (TR 25-30; 30-36)  The CDR testified on re-cross that he attends government compliance<A HREF="03-09912.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> training.  If a contractor employee would report a threat, 
the CDR would learn of it as he is the site manager.  Applicant has never made such a report and has never had a security violation.  Based on the totality of his 
understanding of Applicant's family ties in Israel, the CDR maintains his confidence in Applicant and continues to grant him access to the site.  (TR 92-94; 94-97)</P> 
<P>Mr. R, the contractor's site manager who has been with the company for almost four years, has managed the site for over one year and has a Secret clearance.  
Applicant works for a manager who reports to the site manager; however the site manager has daily contact with him.  Applicant's reputation is exceptional; 
Applicant is very dedicated.  Also, Applicant has been "very proactive in his work and very honest in keeping" the manager informed of all situations.  This 
manager assesses Applicant as being honest and truthful.  When he learned of Applicant's family in Israel, the manager had no concerns over Applicant as he 
has conducted himself with honesty and integrity and has been very reliable and dedicated in his work.   Applicant has never had a security violation.  (TR 37-42; 42-50)</P> 
<P>Mr S, who is a manager for the defense contractor and who is also a captain the in Navy Reserve, supervised Applicant  from 1991 to 1995 and has known him 
for over ten years.  Mr. R, who is the site manager, reports to Mr. S.  Mr. S, who is Applicant's third-level supervisor, testified that Applicant is viewed as an 
honest individual and a hard-working person; he always tries to do "the right thing."  He views Applicant as having a lot of integrity and being very reliable; he 
would rate him in the top 25 percent of employees in his capacity.   After he learned that Applicant has family in Israel, he concluded that relationship would 
have no impact on his performance nor reliability in protecting and safeguarding classified material as he has confidence in Applicant despite the higher risk.  
Applicant has never had any security violations.  Mr. S has a Secret clearance and has attended briefings on DoD security policy in the area of foreign influence.  
r. S knows that security policy requires individuals to report any attempts to solicit information inappropriately.   Mr. S is confident that Applicant would 
comply with those requirements if such an event were to occur.   (TR 51-55; 56-66)</P> 
<P>Mr. C, who was the contractor's site manager and Applicant's second-level supervisor from 1998 to January 2004, testified that during that period he saw 
Applicant on a daily basis.  Mr. C served 33 years with the U.S. Navy and nine years with the contractor and has a Secret clearance.  Mr. C has himself taken 
annual security briefings and is aware of the DoD policy on foreign influence.  He has never questioned Applicant's integrity or loyalty to the U.S. even 
knowing that Applicant has family in Israel.  Applicant took annual compliance training and Mr. C is confident that should Applicant ever be improperly 
approached he would immediately report it.  He promoted Applicant twice based on his performance on the job.  Applicant never had a security violation.  (TR 
68-72; 73-77)</P> 
<P>Mr. N, who has worked for the contractor for 31 years, has been at the site since 1987 as manager of facility operations and has a Secret clearance.  He has been 
Applicant's direct supervisor since November 2002.   He reported that Applicant's reputation is that he meets the highest standards of integrity.  He assessed 
Applicant as being a junior engineer who is given senior engineering challenges on a daily basis and performs quite well.  He recommended him for a 
promotion in 2004 because of his performance.   Applicant has expertise that helps him do  extremely complicated and difficult tasks.  Mr. N interacts with 
Applicant 12 to 15 times a day as Applicant's office is close to his.  Applicant has taken his annual security compliance training where he has been advised 
about what to do if he were every approached inappropriately for classified information.   Mr. N has confidence in Applicant based on his character and 
performance; thus, Mr. N does not have security concerns over his family in Israel.  (TR 78-85; 86-90)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Because of Applicant's family ties in Israel, the government<A HREF="03-09912.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> raised foreign influence concerns under disqualifying conditions (DC):  E2.A2.1.2. 1.  An 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country; and   E2.A2.1.2.6. Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government.  Applicant's 
mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel and lives in the U.S., his brother is a dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel who resides in Israel, and his nieces are 
dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel and resides in Israel. One niece now serves in the Israeli military.  </P> 
<P>While I have seriously considered these security concerns and the document submitted for administrative notice which raises security concerns over Israel's 
extensive industrial espionage, I conclude Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to meet the burden these circumstances present.   Applicant mitigated<A HREF="03-09912.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Government's security concerns over possible foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors: E.2.21.1.  The nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; E2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; E2.2.1.3.  The frequency and recency of the 
conduct; E2.2.1.4.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; E2.2.1.5.  The voluntariness of the participation; E2.2.1.6.  The presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; E.2.2.1.7.  The motivation for the conduct; E.2.2.1.8.  The potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and E.2.2.1.9.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (E.2.2. Adjudication Process)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at all of these factors, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence  security concerns.  Given his strong ties to the U.S. and his limited 
contact with Israel since he became a U.S. naturalized citizen, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation or duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.)  All of his immediate family are in the U.S., and his financial ties are exclusively to the U.S.  First of all, Applicant 
has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for over thirty years and has not returned to Israel since he left in 1962.   Second, Applicant has had a security clearance 
since March 1985 and has had no reported security incidents.  While he has contact with his brother and  his family in Israel, that contact is limited.  During 
2005 he spoke to his brother three or four times and has never visited his brother and family in Israel.  He no longer has contact with his nieces.  As the brother 
served four years in the U.S. military, Applicant asserts his brother  "has never and would never try to influence, coerce or threaten" Applicant to be disloyal  to 
the oath he took when he was given his clearance. His mother visits Israel but has not lived there since 2002.  Even when she lived in Israel near her son who 
had returned to Israel, she continued to pay her U.S. taxes.  Applicant's brother is in the private sector and has no ties to the government of Israel.  While his 
niece serves in the Israeli military, he has limited contact with her.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Significant these family ties in Israel have not raised any security concerns with the individuals who know Applicant best at the classified site where he works.   
The military site manger (CDR) and four corporate managers (Mr. R, S, C, and N) who have supervised Applicant and have close knowledge of his 
performance and character testified extensively on why they continue to have confidence in Applicant based on his consistently high performance and his 
excellent character.  All recommended without hesitation that he continue to have access to classified information:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Commander (CDR) described Applicant's reputation as a "very hard worker."  Applicant is "very trustworthy."  He has never questioned Applicant's 
handling of security-sensitive information or materials.  The CDR is aware that Applicant's mother lives with Applicant.  Based on his knowledge of the 
Applicant's performance and character, the CDR had no security concerns when he learned that Applicant had family in Israel, including a niece in the Israeli 
military.  The CDR had confidence in Applicant's overall trustworthiness and reliability.  If he had any doubts, the CDR has the authority to bar Applicant from 
the facility. Based on the totality of his understanding of Applicant, the CDR continues to have confidence in him and continues to grant him access to the site. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Mr. N, who has been Applicant's direct supervisor since November 2002, described Applicant's reputation as meeting the highest standards of integrity.  
Applicant is a junior engineer who is given and meets senior engineering challenges.  Applicant has taken his annual security compliance training where he has 
been advised about what to do if he were every approached inappropriately for classified information.  Mr. N has confidence in Applicant based on his character 
and performance; thus, Mr. N does not have security concerns over Applicant's family in Israel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Mr. R, the contractor's site manager for over one year portrayed Applicant's reputation as exceptional; Applicant is honest and truthful.  When he learned of 
Applicant's family in Israel, the manager had no concerns over Applicant as he has conducted himself with honesty and integrity and has been very reliable and 
dedicated in his work.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Mr S, who supervised Applicant  from 1991 to 1995 and has known him for over ten years and who is Applicant's third-level supervisor, testified that 
Applicant is viewed as an honest and hard-working person; Applicant has integrity and is reliable.  After he learned that Applicant has family in Israel, he 
concluded that relationship would have no impact on Applicant's performance nor reliability in protecting and safeguarding classified material as he has 
confidence in Applicant despite the higher risk.  Applicant has never had any security violations.  Mr. S is confident that Applicant would comply with security 
requirements to report any attempts to solicit information inappropriately.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Mr. C, who was the contractor's site manager and Applicant's second-level supervisor from 1998 to January 2004, testified that during that period he saw 
Applicant on a daily basis.  Mr. C served 33 years with the U.S. Navy and nine years with the contractor and has a Secret clearance.  Mr. C has himself taken 
annual security briefings and is aware of the DoD policy on foreign influence.  He has never questioned Applicant's integrity or loyalty to the U.S. even 
knowing that Applicant has family in Israel.  Applicant took annual compliance training and Mr. C is confident that should Applicant ever be improperly 
approached he would immediately report it.  He promoted Applicant twice based on his performance on the job.  Applicant never had a security violation.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given his long history of responsible conduct with his employer as attested to by his managers and the government site manager, it is unlikely that  he could be 
exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the government in Israel </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his mother, his 
sibling, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and his niece and his loyalty to the United States.  Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his 
immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if 
they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  After considering the 
Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude these circumscribed family ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks 
of undue pressure on Applicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. in 
Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P>
