<P>Applicant's retention of his U.K. passport after his naturalization as a U.S. citizen--an act demonstrating potential foreign preference--was mitigated where 
Applicant had retained the passport only because he had never been given any instructions that he should surrender it, had not used the passport after becoming 
a U.S. citizen--and thought he might need proof of that fact--had indicated an intent to use only his U.S. passport even before he became aware of the "Money 
emo", and had surrendered it in accordance with the "Money Memo" once he became aware of its provisions. Applicant's prospective foreign influence was 
mitigated where his parents and in-laws were retired (and when working, not working in any positions connected to the U.K. government) and his brother was 
employed in the construction industry. Circumstances of their lives in the U.K. did not suggest that Applicant would be subject to pressure on their behalf. 
Similarly, Applicant's foreign financial interest--in the form of a life insurance policy--presented no prospect of coercion or duress. Clearance granted.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 31 May 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 19 June 
2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to a different Administrative Judge, but was re-assigned to me on 
2 October 2002, when the Applicant requested a change in venue, and I received the case the same day. I set the case on 11 October 2002, and issued a notice of 
hearing the same day for a hearing on 28 October 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   At the hearing, the Government presented three exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented ten exhibits--also admitted 
without objection--and the testimony of one witness, himself. DOHA received the transcript on 5 November 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 45-year-old general manager of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in England in 1957, making him a citizen of the United Kingdom. He came to the U.S. in 1982, when he was 25 years old, on a work visa 
related to his inter-company transfer. He obtained resident status in the U.S. in 1984. He applied for U.S. citizenship in 1997, and became a naturalized citizen 
in June 1999. He obtained his U.S. passport in August 1999. He does not consider himself a dual citizen (Tr. 65). He has expressed a willingness to formally 
renounce his U.K. citizenship (Tr. 66).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's spouse, a woman he met in England in 1977, emigrated to the U.S. in 1983, and married Applicant in 1984. Applicant and his wife have two 
children, ages 15 and 10; both are U.S.-born citizens. She has resided continually in the U.S. with her family since her marriage to Applicant. She is applying 
for U.S. citizenship, having evolved slower than Applicant to the point where she realized that her life was in the U.S. (Tr. 67).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he possessed a U.K. passport issued in February 1999 (while Applicant's application for U.S. citizenship was pending, 
but Applicant was still a citizen only of the United Kingdom ). This passport would  not expire until February 2009. Applicant used his U.K. passport to travel 
to Australia on business in April 1999--before his naturalization as a U.S. citizen. Indeed, Applicant renewed his U.K. passport, which was expiring, so that he 
could make this business trip.<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 20 September 1999, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86) (G.E. 1) on which truthfully disclosed his foreign connections and 
travel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 19 April 2001, Applicant gave a sworn statement to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) (G.E. 2), describing his foreign connections, 
particularly his U.K. passport and his potential foreign preference:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to becoming a U.S. citizen, I traveled on my British passport for business and pleasure. . . However, since becoming a U.S. citizen, I have traveled 
exclusively on my U.S. passport.<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> My British passport  is valid to 26 February 2009 but I do not intend to use it; I am more than willing to relinquish it.<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   Even though Britain recognizes dual citizenship and will always consider me a British subject, I renounced my loyalty to Britain when I took the oath of 
allegiance to the U.S. I do not and will not take advantage of any possible benefits, privileges, or rights that could be derived from my former British citizenship 
and not and will not bear arms for Britain. I have not been in the British military and have no mandatory British military requirement to fulfill. I have not 
performed any kind of alternative service for Britain, either for the government, the military, or any British industrial establishment. I have not voted in any 
British election since first comint to the U.S. in 1981. I have not used a U.S. Government position of trust or responsibility to influence decisions in order to 
serve the interests of another government in preference to those of the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant described, consistent with his sworn statement, how he came to apply for U.S. citizenship:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I applied to become a U.S. citizen because I'd lived in the U.S. since 1982. By the time I got into the 1990s, I'd had children here. It was obvious to me that I 
was never going back to the U.K. to live in the U.K. I had very few friends in the U.K. and all of my social activity was in the U.S. And I just decided that I was 
a person that lived in the United States and upheld the beliefs of the United States. And I just really wanted to formalize that whole process (Tr. 39).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant initially retained his U.K. passport because he knew of no reason not to. He did not surrender it after he got his U.S. passport because he had received 
no indication that the should do so (Tr. 63). He used only his U.S. passport on trips to Europe despite the fact that European Union immigration policies would 
have made use of his U.K. passport more convenient (Tr. 55).When the DSS agent expressed concern that he still had the passport, Applicant tried to give it to 
the agent, who declined (Tr 56). When Applicant got the SOR, he cut the U.K. passport in half, so it could not be used, but kept it so he would have proof of his 
claim that he had not used it since becoming a U.S. citizen (Tr. 57). Not until his attorneys advised him of the ramifications of the Money Memo did Applicant 
understand that he might be required to relinquish his passport (Tr. 64). Applicant surrendered his U.K. passport to the British Embassy on the day of the 
hearing (Tr. 33; A.E. A., B.). Surrender of the passport does not constitute formal renunciation of U.K. citizenship  (A.E. A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother, father, and brother are U.K. citizens living in the U.K. His mother and father are retired; father from the construction business, mother from 
work as a legal assistant. His brother is in the construction business in a different part of the U.K.(Tr. 40). None have any connection to the U.K. government 
(Tr. 66-67). Applicant's in-laws are also U.K. citizens living in the U.K. Both are retired from the graphics design business they owned (Tr. 41). Applicant sees 
his relatives when he is in the U.K. on business, and has also taken family vacations to Europe and the U.K. so his children can spend time with their 
grandparents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had a bank account and credit card from the U.K. that he had gotten when he was about 18. In recent years, the account had little activity (Tr. 42). 
The balance in September 1998 was &pound;104.40 (roughly $150.00) and had declined to &pound;72.10 when Applicant closed the account in August 2002 (A.E. D.) The 
only activity on the account appears to have been the &pound;10.00 annual fee for the credit card, which itself had not been used since about December 1998 (A.E. E.), 
and is now closed. Applicant prefers to use his U.S. credit card (A.E. F.), which gets frequent flyer points, but in any event, use of a credit card (debt) is not a 
financial interest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife also have a life insurance policy issued in the U.K. that they bought in 1985 as part of a real estate transaction (A.E. G., H). They sold 
the property shortly after buying it because of the logistical problems of dealing with rental property far away, but kept the insurance policy initially because the 
cash surrender value of the policy was less than they had invested in the account, and the dollar/pound sterling exchange rate was not very good for dollars. 
Later, they  thought the policy might be a good college fund for their son (Tr. 50).The death benefit is &pound;32,000 (Tr. 72), but the value of the account at maturity 
(2010) is expected to be only about &pound;29,000 ($40,000.00), a payout that depends on stock prices both in the U.K. and overseas (similar to a mutual fund)(Tr. 50; 
A.E. H.). Applicant's wife pays the &pound;47 monthly premium by direct withdrawal from a checking account (A.E. I); Applicant replenishes the account as 
necessary to make the payments (Tr. 69). Applicant has stated a willingness to close the account if required, but the early-termination provisions of the policy 
make that an unattractive option. Nothing in the policy documents submitted by Applicant suggests that  issuance of the policy or its terms is tied to U.K. 
citizenship status.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One of Applicant's subordinates considers Applicant a trustworthy individual, loyal only to the U.S. (A.E. J).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for

bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of  affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.1. Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum (the "Money 
emo") to clarify the application of Guideline C., Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the 
ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum </SPAN><STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</STRONG>(Emphasis added).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant possessed a U.K. passport after his naturalization in 2000, he has not exercised dual citizenship with the U.K. While his U.S. citizenship 
oath may not operate to terminate his U.K. citizenship under U.K. law, the citizenship oath gives a strong indication of an intent to sever ties to the birth 
country. Nevertheless, his foreign citizenship possesses little security significance if based solely on his birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to 
fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, he must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United 
States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under 
Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the 
foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under this assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C. 
Nevertheless, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant convincingly asserts that he prefers his U.S. citizenship. The single instance of conduct to the contrary--retaining his U.K. passport after becoming a 
U.S. citizen--is mitigated by a number of factors. First, he credibly asserts that he retained the passport only because he did not know what else to do with it, 
and had no reason to know that he should dispose of it. Second, he never used the passport; even when traveling to the U.K. and Europe he used his U.S. 
passport, although it would have been more convenient to use his U.K. passport. Third, before becoming aware of the specifics of the "Money Memo," he 
stated a clear intention to use only his U.S. passport for foreign travel. Fourth, when it became clear to Applicant that his retention of the passport was an issue, 
he rather ineptly chose to make the passport unusable by cutting it in half.<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Finally, when he became aware of the requirements of the "Money Memo," he 
surrendered the passport to the British Embassy. Further, Applicant stated a clear willingness to formally renounce his U.K. citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has resided in the U.S. since he was 25 years old and became a U.S. citizen when he began to realize that his loyalties had shifted to the U.S. and the 
life he and his wife had built here. His national preference seems overwhelmingly for the U.S. In addition, I found Applicant's testimony that he considers 
himself a citizen of the U.S. only to be credible. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline C. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, the Government has established its case under Guideline B., but I consider the security concerns mitigated. Applicant's immediate family 
and in-laws are U.K. citizens residing in the U.K. His contacts with his family are not casual and infrequent. However, the record evidence clearly indicates that 
Applicant's relatives are not agents of a foreign power, nor are they in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.<A HREF="01-21490.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Common sense demonstrates there is 
nothing in the record to suggest that the family's relationship with Applicant is such that Applicant would be forced to chose between his duty to his parents and 
his duty to the U.S. In a similar fashion, Applicant's bank account and credit card account were minimal even before Applicant closed them in August 2002. 
His life insurance policy is certainly a substantial financial interest. However, common sense suggests that there is nothing in the insurance policy that could 
make Applicant vulnerable to foreign influence--an important element of the disqualifying factor. Conversely, while the financial interest is not minimal, it is 
nevertheless not sufficient to affect Applicant's security responsibilities. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

countries. The U.K. is neither a totalitarian regime, nor a regime known to engage in human rights violations, nor a known sponsor of state terrorism. Thus, it is 
extremely unlikely that the U.K. government would target Applicant's family to extract information from Applicant. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant's 
family is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family and the U.S., based on 
all available evidence.
