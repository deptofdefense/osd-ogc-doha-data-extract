<P>In answer to Module 26 on an undated and unsigned Electronic Personal Security Questionnaire SF 86 Worksheet (EPSQW), the Applicant failed to disclose 
that he was arrested for and charged with burglary in 1996.  As the Applicant admits that this was a knowing and wilful falsification, the provisions of 18 U.S.C 
1001 are applicable.  Mitigation is not shown; and as such, Guidelines E and J are found against the Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on September 2, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on November 26, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on December 18, 2003, and submitted nothing in  reply.  The case was originally assigned to another judge, 
and was received by the undersigned for resolution on April 26, 2004.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted Personal Conduct and 
related Criminal Conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 26 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In answer to Module 26 on an undated and unsigned EPSQW, the Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested for and charged with burglary in 1996 
(Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at page 12).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his June 6, 2002, sworn statement, the Applicant states, "I did not list this incident on my Security Questionnaire 
because I did not think a detailed review of records would be conducted.  I also did not want my employer to find out about the stupid thing I did at age 18 . . ." 
(GX 8 at page 2).  In his August 22, 2003, Answer to the SOR, the Applicant further avers "I admit to deliberately omitting my prior convictions because I did 
not want my employer to find out" (GX 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.  The Applicant's admitted lack of candor is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  This federal statute states, in part, the following, "[w]hoever . . . knowingly 
and wilfully falsifies . . . a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or 
document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined . . . or imprisoned . . ."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as  set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant filed out his EPSQW, he deliberately withheld from the Government that he was arrested and charged with burglary in 1996.  The second 
Disqualifying Condition is therefore applicable as there is a "deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire . . . or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . ."  No Mitigating 
Conditions are applicable.  As there was a wilful falsification, Guideline E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his admitted Criminal Conduct, his false representation on his EPSQW is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  The first Disqualifying Condition is 
therefore applicable as there is an "admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged."  Again, no Mitigating Conditions 
are applicable; and as such, Guideline J is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his admitted Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct.  The 
Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate 
burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
