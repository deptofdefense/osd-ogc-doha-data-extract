<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 27, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,"</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 9, 2000, but notarized on October 10, 2000, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a 
hearing.  The case was initially assigned to Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny II, on November 22, 2000, but, due to caseload considerations, was subsequently 
reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on December 28, 2000.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 10, 2001, and the hearing was held before 
me on February 6, 2001.</P> 
 
<P>At the close of that session, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence presented, and an objection was interposed by Applicant.  The 
parties were afforded an opportunity to respond and present argument on the motion, and the matter was continued <EM>sine die</EM>. Another notice of hearing was issued on 
arch 28, 2001, and the continuation of the hearing was held before me on April 18, 2001.  During the course of the combined sessions, five Government exhibits and 
four Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The initial verbatim transcript (Tr.I) was received on 
February 13, 2001, and the second verbatim transcript (Tr.II) was received on April 26, 2001.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>At the commencement of the Government's case Department Counsel requested Official Notice be taken of United States Code Service Title 8 Aliens and Nationality, 
Chapter 12 Immigration and Nationality Adjustment and Change of Status Nationality Through Naturalization, Section 1448 Oath of renunciation and allegiance; as well 
as the passport policy clarification issued in August 2000 by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I).  
Pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.), I took Official Notice as requested, over the objections of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also objected to the retroactive application of the policy clarification set forth in the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum and was offered an opportunity to submit briefs on 
the matter.  He eventually chose not to do so.</P> 
 
<P>As stated above, at the close of the initial session, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence presented.  Specifically, she sought to 
amend paragraph 3 thereof by adding a subparagraph "b."  The newly requested subparagraph was to be as follows:</P> 
 
<P>You falsified on a SF 86 executed by you on March 3, 1999, on which you were required to reply to the following question #16. <STRONG>"Foreign Countries You Have 
Visited </STRONG>Have you traveled outside the United States on other than official U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years? (Travel as a dependent or contractor must be 
listed.)  Do not repeat travel covered in modules 4, 5, and 6." on which you answered "Yes" and listed one trip from June 3, 1996 to December 7, 1996 to Morocco 
when in fact you well knew and sought to conceal you made an additional trip to Morocco from January 11, 1995 to January 21, 1995.</P> 
 
<P>I granted the motion to amend, over the objections of Applicant.  The gravamen of Applicant's objection to the procedure set forth in Enclosure 3 of the Directive<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> which 
permits amendment of the SOR was that it was violative of Applicant's right to due process and administrative due process of law.  Applicant's contention was not 
supported by any legal citations, and this is not the appropriate forum to address "constitutional" arguments.</P> 
 
<P>During final argument, Department Counsel conceded Applicant had previously furnished a truthful response to an inquiry in his Security Clearance 
Application--pertaining to one particular purported financial delinquency--as well as subsequent evidence of extenuation and explanation regarding subparagraph 3.a.(1) 
of the SOR, sufficient to mitigate and overcome the Government's case with respect to that allegation.  Department Counsel also conceded the remaining allegation 
(subparagraph 3.a.(2) of the SOR) pertaining to a purported financial delinquency was "probably not material" and minimized its national security significance.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline C (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.), as well as the factual allegation 
pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraph 2.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denied all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 3.a.(1), 3.a.(2), and 3.b.).</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 34 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not be revealed.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant was born in 1967 in Morocco--a nation whose interests are not inimical to the United States.  Over the next 19 years, while residing with his family, he 
exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of Morocco.  After graduation from a Moroccan high school, in 1987, he moved to the 
United States to pursue higher education.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He received his undergraduate degree from a university in the United States in August 1992, and his MBA degree from 
another university in the United States in 1997.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  While obtaining his education, as well as thereafter, Applicant was employed in a variety of positions in the United 
States.</P> 
 
<P>In January 1995, while employed in the United States, Applicant used his Moroccan passport when he took a 10 day pleasure trip to visit his family in Morocco.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After 
residing in the United States for about eight years, in March 1995, and upon completing the required immigration and naturalization citizenship process, Applicant became 
a naturalized citizen of the United States.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He is now a dual citizen of the United States and Morocco.  At the time he took his oath of allegiance and was granted his 
new citizenship, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) asked if he wanted to change his name and/or keep his Moroccan passport.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He chose 
to keep both his name and his passport.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Since becoming an American citizen, Applicant has exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of the United States.  He registered 
with the Selective Service System and was assigned a registration number,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and obtained, and used, a United States passport.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Conversely, Applicant has not accepted 
any benefits from Morocco, except one, as further described below; has not served in the Moroccan military and is unwilling to do so; has not used his Moroccan 
citizenship to protect financial or business interests in Morocco; and is not seeking or holding political office in Morocco.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, he has never voted in a 
oroccan election.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In June 1996, Applicant again used his Moroccan passport when he took a lengthy pleasure trip to visit his family in Morocco.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  This time, however, instead of briefly 
visiting his family and returning to the United States, Applicant remained in Morocco for six months and actually worked in his family's Moroccan-based business as an 
assistant manager.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  When Applicant returned to Morocco in 1999 and 2000, he used his United States passport on both occasions.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Moroccan passport expired on June 15, 1999, and was not renewed.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He has no intention of ever doing so.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends his 1996 use of the Moroccan passport was not intended, by him, to state a preference for Morocco over the United States.  In 1999, he 
acknowledged having "a good allegiance towards both countries" but considered the United States as his home and Morocco as simply a place to visit.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Applicant is 
unsure if he is still considered a dual citizen or citizen of Morocco, and if he is, is prepared to renounce his Moroccan citizenship.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Both of Applicant's parents are native-born citizens and life-long residents of Morocco.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> They own a printing business<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and are not employees of the Moroccan 
Government.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  They last visited Applicant in the United States while on a visit here in the summer of 1999.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He also has four brothers and one sister, all of whom 
reside with their parents in Morocco.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Three of his siblings work in the family printing business and two work for themselves.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  None of his siblings are employees of 
the Moroccan Government.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Applicant also has four cousins, some of whom are permanent non-citizen residents, and some of whom are naturalized citizens of the 
United States, who reside in the United States.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  In December 2000, on behalf of Applicant's parents, he submitted petitions to the INS for them to receive permanent 
non-citizen resident status, based on his United States citizenship.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was married to a native-born citizen of the United States in 1990, and that marriage lasted until he was divorced in 1997.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1999, while completing his SF 86,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Applicant addressed a question pertaining to financial delinquencies, ("Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?"),<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Applicant responded "no."  He also addressed another question pertaining to financial delinquencies, ("In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 
days delinquent on any debt(s)?").<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Applicant responded "yes," and provided the information for two such financial obligations.  He included pertinent information 
regarding financial delinquencies to a large retail chain and a large commercial bank.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Report of Credit generated on him in May 1999<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> revealed what appeared to be four such obligations seemingly coming within the scope of the question.  One 
obligation, to a large retail chain in the amount of $959.00<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> was 120 days delinquent, and is the one referred to in the SOR at subparagraph 3.a.(1).  Another obligation, 
in the amount of $632.00,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> was considered a bad debt which had been charged off, and is the one referred to in the SOR at subparagraph 3.a.(2).  Another obligation, 
to a large commercial bank in the amount of $1,236.00,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> was 120 days delinquent, and is not referred to in the SOR.  The remaining obligation, to the same large retail 
chain referred to previously in a zero amount,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> was considered 120 days delinquent, but was transferred or sold to an unidentified entity, and is not referred to in the 
SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant satisfied the delinquent obligation to the large retail chain identified by him on the SF 86 (listed twice under two different creditors in the May 1999 Report of 
Credit), and as of August 1999,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> the account was considered "settled," with a zero balance.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  He also satisfied the delinquent obligation to the large commercial bank 
identified by him on the SF 86, and as of August 1999,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> the account was considered "settled," with a zero balance.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  Finally, he satisfied the delinquent obligation to 
the remaining creditor identified by him on the SF 86, and as of August 1999,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> the account was also considered "settled," with a zero balance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant subsequently denied intending to deceive or falsify, and noted two of his financial delinquencies were identified elsewhere in the SF 86,<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A></SPAN> and he was not aware 
of the third account at the time he completed the form.<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for 
access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are 
intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge 
should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>[GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE]:</STRONG>  <STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) the exercise of dual citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>(2) possession and/or use of a foreign passport.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>(2) indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>(4) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, on August 16, 2000, ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I issued a passport policy clarification pertaining to Adjudicative Guideline C--foreign preference.  I have taken Official 
Notice of the memorandum which states, in pertinent part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The guideline 
specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal 
convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigating factor addresses the official approval of the United 
States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this guideline are that the possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. 
passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  
<STRONG><EM>Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or 
obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government. </EM></STRONG> Modification of the Guideline is not required.  (Emphasis 
supplied)</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>[GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE]:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations 
could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, 
or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(1) a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents 
of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Personal Conduct - Guideline E]: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness 
to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form 
used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None apply.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of 
the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the 
Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, 
the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts 
raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts 
and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline C, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who failed to formally renounce his Moroccan 
citizenship and acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country--in this instance, Morocco--over the United States, and in so doing, he may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  In support of its contentions, the Government has cited Applicant's 
dual citizenship with Morocco and the United States; and his use of his Moroccan passport.</P> 
 
<P>The Government has alleged Applicant continues to actively "exercise" citizenship of Morocco--derived from his birth in that country; and the United States, facts 
disputed by Applicant. The evidence of the purported "exercise" of citizenship to support that allegation is one-time use of his Moroccan passport in 1996, after he had 
become an American citizen.  The Government contends his feelings for Morocco, and his use of a Moroccan passport, and even his lengthy stay in Morocco in 1996, 
are inconsistent with his oath of United States citizenship.  When Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States, he took an oath "in a public ceremony . . . to 
renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty of whom the applicant for U.S. citizenship was before a 
subject or citizen," and shortly thereafter registered with the Selective Service System to defend the United States, if called upon to do so. That he maintained some 
degree of affection for Morocco should not be construed as a preference for it over the United States. Congress did not intend that a new citizen such as Applicant should 
be "required to renounce any sentimental fondness or affection he might have for his native land."<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant may have intended to renounce his foreign citizenship when he took the oath for United States citizenship, but his subsequent actions in using the previously 
issued foreign passport, and keeping it until 1999, seemingly indicate his continued allegiance to both countries.  His more recent actions in permitting the Moroccan 
passport to expire in June 1999; vowing not to renew it in the future; and in declaring his willingness to renounce his Moroccan citizenship, if he still has it, would seem 
more consistent with his contention he considers himself primarily an American citizen.  Thus, there is evidence of one foreign citizenship--Moroccan--along with United 
States citizenship, with no evidence of the <EM>current active</EM> exercise of that foreign citizenship other than the passed one-time use and possession of the foreign 
passport--until it expired.  In my estimation, Applicant's status in this regard falls within foreign preference disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A3.1.2.2., but Applicant also enjoys the benefit of foreign preference mitigating condition (MC) E2.A3.1.3.1., and MC E2.A3.1.3.4.</P> 
 
<P>Obviously, it is of substantial concern Applicant kept and used his Moroccan passport after he became an American citizen.  It is clear that possession of a foreign 
passport cannot be considered merely in isolation, but should be analyzed in light of all the facts and circumstances, "with the adjudicator needing to consider whether the 
facts and circumstances of possession reasonably indicate the applicant is demonstrating a foreign preference within the meaning of [Guideline] C."<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> The record does not 
support the contention Applicant continued to actively "exercise" his Moroccan citizenship after the expiration of the Moroccan passport.  Applicant's citizenship oath, his 
conscious decision to permit the Moroccan passport to expire, and Applicant's subsequent statements, offer sufficient positive proof of a present intention, or at least a 
willingness, to renounce his Moroccan citizenship, to the extent it still exists.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, in August 2000, ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I issued a passport policy clarification.  The declared intent of the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo was "to clarify the application of Guideline C 
to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  In this instance, the one-time use of the Moroccan passport as well as the expiration of that 
passport both occurred before the issuance of the ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo.  The ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I memo further states there are no mitigating factors "related to an applicant's personal 
convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I construe to relate solely to the use of a foreign passport, and not 
to mere possession of same.  On the other hand, the memo states "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the 
applicant surrenders the foreign passport. . . ."  In my view, Applicant has already "surrendered" the passport by allowing it to expire, with no intent to renew it.  Thus, I 
conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect to Guideline C.  
Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, Applicant's parents, and his three brothers and one sister--are 
not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  This situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  In support of its contentions, the Government has cited the fact Applicant's parents and 
siblings are citizens and residents of Morocco.  Based on my review of the evidence, I conclude the security concerns manifested by the Government, in this instance, are 
largely unfounded.</P> 
 
<P>It is uncontroverted that Applicant's parents and siblings--persons to whom he has close ties of affection--are citizens and residents of Morocco.  That simple fact, 
standing alone, is sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, the mere possession 
of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:<A HREF="00-0463.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  Whether an 
applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents and three of his five siblings work in the family printing business in Morocco.  The other two siblings work for themselves.  There is no evidence to 
indicate they are involved in any "intelligence work" for the Moroccan Government, and they have no "official ties" to the Moroccan Government.  Applicant also has four 
cousins, some of whom are permanent non-citizen residents, and some of whom are naturalized citizens of the United States, who reside in the United States.  These facts, 
when considered in light of the nature of the government in Morocco--a friendly Kingdom which is not hostile to the United States, and whose interests are not inimical to 
the United States--facilitates an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set forth therein.</P> 
 
<P>The residence and citizenship of Applicant's family members are clearly of security concern under foreign influence disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1., but the 
significance of that ruling is mitigated by the "protection" afforded by foreign influence mitigating condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1.  It must also be noted Applicant's parents 
intend to reside in the United States.  In this instance, after an examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's parents and siblings, considering their citizenship 
and residency status, do not constitute an unacceptable security risk. Furthermore, their continuing personal relationship is viewed in positive terms, having no security 
significance.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect 
to Guideline B. Accordingly, allegation 2.a. of the SOR is concluded in favor of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the Government has failed to establish its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because he willfully 
falsified, omitted, and concealed true facts in responses to inquiries pertaining to his financial delinquencies and foreign travel.  While <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the deliberate omission, concealment, 
or falsification of relevant and material facts from the SF 86 may be grounds for disqualification, in this instance, Applicant has steadfastly denied any willful intent to falsify, 
omit, or conceal the facts in issue.  Applicant noted he responded to the inquiry pertaining to financial delinquencies by identifying two such accounts in the question 
immediately preceding the one in issue.  Common sense would indicate if Applicant admitted financial obligations which were 180 days delinquent, those same obligations 
would be 90 days delinquent as well.  Furthermore, I cannot conceive any possible motivation to deny a 90 day delinquency when there was already an acknowledgment 
of a 180 day delinquency.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, as noted above, the Department Counsel </SPAN>conceded Applicant had previously furnished a truthful response to the inquiry in his Security Clearance 
Application--pertaining to one particular purported financial delinquency--as well as subsequent evidence supporting his position regarding subparagraph 3.a.(1) of the 
SOR, sufficient to mitigate and overcome the Government's case with respect to that allegation.  Department Counsel also conceded the remaining allegation 
(subparagraph 3.a.(2) of the SOR) pertaining to a purported financial delinquency was "probably not material" and minimized its national security significance.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I agree.  
Accordingly, allegations 3.a.(1) and 3.a.(2) of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As for the allegation which was the subject of the motion to amend the SOR, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has steadfastly denied any willful intent to falsify, omit, or conceal his foreign travel 
in January 1995--a 10 day pleasure trip to Morocco which occurred before he became a citizen of the United States.  He contends he listed the most recent travel to 
orocco--the six month home visit with his parents and siblings--and did not intend to deceive.  Applicant offered no explanation other than speculating the 1995 trip 
may have slipped his mind at the time; or he may have misconstrued the question by reading it literally; or he may have believed he had previously listed such travel 
elsewhere and misconstrued the caution not to repeat travel covered in other modules.  In any event, there is clear evidence Applicant took the trip, but no evidence 
whatsoever to characterize his failure to list it as anything other than a simple oversight or mistake.  There is no evidence the failure to list the 1995 travel was intentional or 
an effort to deceive the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I had the opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor 
or evasiveness, read his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those around him.  It is my impression Applicant's explanations are 
both consistent and sincere, and have the solid resonance of truth.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated 
and refuted the Government's case in this regard.  Accordingly, allegation 3.b. of the SOR is concluded in favor of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
