  The Administrative Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable in light of the record evidence as a whole and the Judge's assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony.  The factual errors identified by Applicant on appeal do not warrant remand or reversal  because they are not material to the outcome of the case.  Applicant has not shown that the Judge erred by deciding to not apply Personal  Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 4.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  The  favorable evidence cited by Applicant on appeal did not preclude the Judge from making an unfavorable security clearance decision.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 17, 2003, which stated 
the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated November 16, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether certain findings of fact by the Administrative Judge are not supported by the 
record evidence; (2) whether the Administrative Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for concluding Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Condition 4 applies; (3) whether the Administrative Judge should have applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 4; and (4) 
whether the Administrative Judge failed to consider evidence that Applicant is a good, reliable, and conscientious employee, and that 
Applicant has not committed a security violation.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether certain findings of fact by the Administrative Judge are not supported by the record evidence</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that some of the 
findings of fact by the Administrative Judge are speculative and not supported by the record evidence.  Applicant also contends the Judge 
erred by finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application he executed in January 2001.  Applicant's claims of error have mixed 
merit.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant persuasively argues that some of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact<A HREF="02-10113.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> are speculative in nature and are not adequately 
supported by the record evidence.  However, the erroneous factual findings identified by Applicant on appeal do not warrant remand or 
reversal because they are not material to the outcome of this case.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's findings of falsification is not persuasive.  Given the record evidence in this case, the 
Judge had to decide whether to accept or reject Applicant's explanations for his answers to Questions 17 and 19 on the Security Clearance 
Application.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, and giving deference to the Administrative Judge's assessment of the credibility of 
Applicant's hearing testimony, the Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable.  The Board is not required to decide whether it agrees with 
the Judge's findings to conclude they are sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for concluding Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 4 applies</SPAN>.  
Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's application of Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 4.<A HREF="02-10113.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board need not decide 
whether this claim of error is persuasive.  The Judge's decision sets forth reasons for his adverse  conclusions about Applicant's security 
eligibility that are sufficient to support his unfavorable decision independent of the Judge's application of Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Conduct 4.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge should have applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 4</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the 
Administrative Judge should have applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-10113.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 4<A HREF="02-10113.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> in his 
favor.  This contention is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1, Applicant's argument about his beliefs concerning his discharge from the Air Force 
is not persuasive.  Federal officials, not individual applicants, are responsible for deciding what information is pertinent to a security clearance 
investigation and adjudication.  Accordingly, Applicant's beliefs about his discharge from the Air Force are not determinative of whether 
information about his discharge is pertinent to the investigation and adjudication of his security eligibility.  Given the record evidence in this 
case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude the information Applicant omitted was pertinent.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 4, the record evidence in this case did not compel the Administrative Judge to 
conclude that Applicant's omissions were the result of improper or inadequate advice from authorized personnel.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to consider evidence that Applicant is a good, reliable, and conscientious employee, and that 
Applicant has not committed a security violation</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge failed to consider the record evidence which 
shows Applicant is a good, reliable and conscientious employee, and that he has nor committed any security violation.  This contention is not 
persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states 
otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  That presumption is not rebutted merely because Applicant can cite to 
favorable record evidence that he believes the Judge should have given greater weight to.</P> 
 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance and can be based on conduct and 
circumstances unrelated to an applicant's job performance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-20947 (June 18, 2004) at pp. 4-5.  Accordingly, the 
record evidence concerning Applicant's job performance did not preclude the Administrative Judge from evaluating Applicant's security 
eligibility under Guideline E for reasons unrelated to his job performance.</P> 
 
<P>Moreover, the federal government is not required to wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can make an unfavorable 
security clearance decision.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Accordingly, the 
absence of evidence that Applicant has committed a security violation did not preclude the Judge from making an unfavorable security 
clearance decision based on other grounds.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision because Applicant has failed to demonstrate error that warrants 
remand or reversal.</P>
