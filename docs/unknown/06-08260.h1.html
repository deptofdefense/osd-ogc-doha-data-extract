<P>Since 1998, Applicant and her husband incurred over $21,422 in delinquent debt.  They have not filed state and federal income tax returns since 2001.  Most of the financial problems resulted from 
Applicant supporting her parents when they became ill in 1998.  Applicant works a part-time job to meet her monthly expenses but is unable to make payments towards her delinquent accounts.  
She intends to consult a credit counselor at the end of the year, but currently her financial situation remains unsettled. Applicant deliberately failed to list her delinquent accounts on her 
trustworthiness application. She has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal conduct. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive 
position is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On September 24, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 14, 2006, 
DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>August 7, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued 
on September 19, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>October 5, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1- 5 which were admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted no exhibits. </SPAN>The record was held open until October 19, 2006, to allow Applicant to submit further 
documents. A 19 page document was timely submitted and marked as AE A and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 13, 2006.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, but denies the overall concern.  She denies all of the allegations under Guideline E. Applicant's admissions are 
incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year old woman employed as a customer service representative for a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust.  She has worked for her employer 
for two years. She has an associates degree.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She is married and has one son, age 23, and four grown stepchildren.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, Applicant and her husband started to have financial difficulty. During this time, Applicant took on the responsibility of caring for her parents, both of whom had serious health problems 
and limited income. At the time, she was only working part-time. Supporting two households put a strain on the family finances. She relied on credit cards to pay daily living expenses.  Her husband 
is retired from the military and is partially disabled.  He does not work.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the past year and half, Applicant's pay has been garnished for $204 each pay period by the creditor in SOR &para; 1.d related to the automobile repossession. She is paid every two weeks.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> She has

She admits that a balance remains on the account.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Applicant and her husband have not filed state and federal income taxes for tax years 2002-2005.  She claims they did not file tax returns based

hearing, she admitted that she was aware that she owed the IRS for back taxes. She did not intend to hide the debts from the government.  She believes the government knows about everything and

<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and 
discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>   An administrative

factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; 
(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="06-08260.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations, and 
Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant had difficulty meeting her financial obligations since 1998.  Currently, she has six delinquent debts with an approximate total 
balance of $21,422, including back taxes from 2001.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant's delinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because she still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies.  Applicant and her husband encountered financial problems, in part, as a result of providing for her parents and partly, due to her husband's inability to work 
due to his partial disability.  Although MC 3 applies which explains the cause of the debt, an applicant's actions towards resolving the debt should be considered as well.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply.  
Applicant indicates that she intends to enter into a repayment plan with consumer credit counseling within the next 30 days. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial 
considerations concern.  Aside from the debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.d which is being repaid through garnishment of Applicant's wages, all of the other debts remain outstanding. She has not taken steps 
to resolve these debts. At hearing, Applicant admitted that she and her husband have not filed federal and state income taxes since 2001. As a result, she and her husband may have more outstanding 
tax liabilities. Applicant's financial problems remain.  It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is not applicable. In January 2005, Applicant indicated that she and her husband 
were filing for bankruptcy.  In April 2006, she indicated that they would soon enter into a repayment plan with a credit counseling service. Both of these options are legally permissible ways to 
resolve financial problems. Unfortunately, Applicant did not pursue either of these actions prior to the hearing. She made no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent accounts or the income tax 
situation. I cannot conclude that she made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying 
for a security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant explained that she did not list her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on the public trust application because she was not aware of the full extent of the debt. Under 
cross examination, she admitted to at least being aware of the tax debt. I find that she intentionally withheld information about her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on her public trust 
application signed by her on September 24, 2004.  In an affidavit, dated January 28, 2005, Applicant acknowledges that she has encountered financial problems since 1998 and describes the 
difficulties of supporting two households during this time. Contrary to her assertions, the evidence indicates that she was aware of her financial situation when she filled out her public trust 
application.</P> 
 
<P>Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.  Although Applicant claims that she had no intent to keep her financial problems from the government since she believed that the 
government already knew this information, she was required to provide a truthful answer to question 20. When she signed the application, she certified that her answers were "true, complete, and 
correct to best of her knowledge and belief and are made in good faith." However, she admits that she was aware of the delinquent taxes owed but did not list them on her public trust application. I 
find her actions were deliberate.</P> 
 
<P>I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct concern. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has 
negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness position based on her deliberate failure to disclose her delinquent debts and her lack of action towards 
resolving her delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility 
is denied.</P>
