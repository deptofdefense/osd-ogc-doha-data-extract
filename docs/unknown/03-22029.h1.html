<P>Applicant's father, mother, brother and sisters are citizens and residents of Vietnam. None of them works for or is associated with the Government of Vietnam. 
He has limited contact with his parents and no regular contact with his siblings. They are not in a position to be exploited by Vietnam in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has given some money to his parents in Vietnam, 
but the amount is not significant. Applicant's strong attachment to the United States and minimal ties to Vietnam makes it unlikely that he would respond 
favorably to any efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, dated November 26, 2004,  which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 20, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant submitted a signed and sworn response to the SOR. Applicant requested that a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2005, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on March 16, 2005, and the hearing was conducted on April 5, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 4), and at the request of Applicant, the Government called the 
witness as part of its case in chief. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit (Exhibit A)and offered his own testimony and that of three other witnesses.  The 
transcript (Tr) was received on April 18, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's father and mother are 
not United States citizens and reside in Vietnam, and Applicant has traveled to his native Vietnam on three occasions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.c., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all three allegations. These allegations are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 55 year old.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electronic Field Service Technician, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He received an Associates of Arts degree in electronics.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in North Vietnam. In 1954, at the age of five, his family and he moved to South Vietnam to escape the rule of the Communists. He 
remained there, and in 1969, he joined the South Vietnamese Air Force. In 1975, after the fall of South Vietnam, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was placed in what was essentially a 
prison for 3 years. In 1979, he was able to escape from Vietnam with 104 other people on a small fishing boat. He arrived in Indonesia, where he remained until 
1980, when he was allowed to immigrate to the United States (Tr at 17-20).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> became a naturalized United States citizen in 1990. His wife was born in Vietnam, and, like her husband, she also became a naturalized United States 
citizen in 1990.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">They have two children, who were born in the United States and are United States citizens (Tr at 38-39)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> All of Applicant's wife's family 
resides in the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and mother are citizens and residents of Vietnam. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His father had been in the military of South Vietnam, but both his parents have been retired 
for many years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> last saw his parents  in 1999.  He speaks to his father by telephone approximately four times a year, but because of illness and a loss 
of hearing, he is unable to speak to his mother. Applicant contributes approximately $100 a month to his parents (Tr at 23-27). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since he first moved to the United States in 1980, Applicant has traveled to Vietnam on three occasions, the last one occurred in 1999. They were all casual 
trips, either to see his parents or to show his children the country in which his parents were born (Tr at 31).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> brother and four sisters are also Vietnamese citizens and residents. None of them works for or is associated 
with the Government of Vietnam. He has no regular contact with any of them. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no financial interest or property in Vietnam. He estimated that his net worth in the United States is approximately $600,000. Applicant has voted 
in every election in the United States, since he became a U. S. Citizen. He testified that if his parents were ever threatened by the government of Vietnam, he 
would report it to the proper United States authorities (Tr at 34-35, 38).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had three witnesses testify on his behalf, a friend whom he has known since he lived in Vietnam, a former teacher who is also a  mentor, and a 
supervisor. They all spoke highly about him, citing his honesty and trustworthiness, and also speaking about his devotion to the United States </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 36-51)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and siblings are citizens and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Vietnam. The Vietnam citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's immediate 
family creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such a tie raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security 
clearance for him. This </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of family, who are citizens and residents of Vietnam, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A2.1.2.1.).  The fact that the foreign 
country in question is Vietnam, a country under Communist rule, adds to the concern, but that fact is not automatically controlling. Based on the nature of the 
overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the age and lack of government involvement of Applicant's parents, his extremely limited contact with 
his other family members, Applicant's long history since coming to the United States, his ties to his wife and children, who are United States citizens, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and  his 
testimony about his feelings concerning the United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I have determined that his family in Vietnam does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and 
itigating Conditions (MC) (E2.A2.1.3.1.)  applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does contribute some funds to his parents, which could be considered adversely under DC (E2.A2.1.2.8.), but the amount is small. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that 
C (E2.A2.1.3.5.) applies because t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he financial interests are not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests 
of the United States. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities.</SPAN></P>
