<P>The Applicant has been an abusive drinker for most of his adult life.  This has resulted in six arrests and convictions for Driving Under the Influence between 
1980 and 2000.  The Applicant still drinks and does not show any understanding of the problems alcohol has caused him.  Insufficient mitigation is shown.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 15, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative 
Judge on July 7, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 12, 2005.  The case was reassigned to the undersigned on September 13, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on October 7, 2005, at which the Government presented nine documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called 
one additional witness.  He also submitted five hearing exhibits and one post-hearing exhibit.  The transcript was received on October 18, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 56, married and has a high school diploma with additional training.  He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants 
to excess.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this Paragraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been an abusive drinker for most of his adult life.  He began drinking in 1962 and last drank in July 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1980 and 2000, the Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence six times.  These arrests occurred in 1980 (SOR 1.b.), 1983 (SOR 1.c.), 
1988 (SOR 1.d.), 1989 (SOR 1.e.), 1996 (SOR 1.f.), and 2000 (SOR 1.h.).  The 1996 arrest occurred after the Applicant was involved in a serious motor vehicle 
collision.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Several of the arrests resulted in the Applicant being sentenced to varying amounts of time in jail, culminating in 180 days 
in jail for the 2000 arrest.  (<EM>See</EM> SOR 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h.)  After the last arrest the Applicant resigned his position with the Federal Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to being sentenced to jail, the 2000 conviction for Driving Under the Influence resulted in 12 months probation, $2,000 fine, the Applicant's 
automobile was impounded for 30 days and his driver's license was suspended for life in the state where the incident occurred (State A).  (<EM>See</EM> SOR 1.h., 
Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)  Because of that arrest and punishment, the Applicant cannot renew his driver's license in the state where he currently lives 
(State B).  However, the Applicant continues to drive even though he does not currently have a driver's license.  (Transcript at 46-50.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has received treatment for alcohol abuse three times.  The last time was a six month program which ended in May 2001.  The Applicant has been 
diagnosed as alcohol dependent.  This diagnosis is based, in part, on the Applicants history of "reported previous treatment attempts with limited periods of 
sobriety, current and previous employment related discord, recurrent legal problems related to use and self-reported tolerance."  (Government Exhibit 8 at 8.)  
During, and after, each treatment there have been bouts of sobriety of varying lengths.  Eventually, however, the Applicant goes back to drinking.  In addition to 
a beer in June 2005, the Applicant had two or three drinks several times in 2004 while on travel for his job.  (Transcript at 51-53.)  The Applicant does not 
believe himself to be an alcoholic.  "I don't feel like I'm going to be hooked or I'm going to be getting in any trouble.  (Transcript at 64.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this Paragraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  The criminal acts set forth under 
SOR subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h., and described above, will also be considered under this Guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is an able and talented employee, who has made many contributions over the years to the defense industry.  (Applicant's Exhibit E.)  Current co-workers, who work with him on a daily basis, state many very laudatory things about the Applicant and his contributions at the workplace.  (Applicant's 
Exhibits B, C and F.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The president of the company the Applicant currently works for appeared at the hearing and testified on the Applicant's behalf.  He states that the Applicant is 
an extremely valuable employee and that he has not seen any signs of the Applicant drinking on the job.  (Transcript at 25-26, 37-38.)  He further stated that the 
Applicant works long hours and is always ready to help in any situation. (Applicant's Exhibit D.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be found 
under <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN>, below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in criminal conduct and alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has a history of using alcohol to excess and has six 
arrests and convictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (Guideline G); and that his arrests and convictions are criminal acts (Guideline J).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him.  The evidence is clear that the Applicant has a long-standing drinking problem that he either cannot, or will not, admit.  He has 
had six alcohol-related arrests and convictions, all for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  As the convictions have mounted, he has been sentenced to ever 
increasing punishment.  He has also undergone several bouts of treatment, all to evidently little effect.  While it is true that he has not had a conviction for 
driving under the influence since 2000, I am not convinced that he has learned not to drink and drive.  What he does admit is that he continues to drink, even 
after being diagnosed as alcohol-dependent and advised not to drink alcohol.  The evidence also showed that he continues to drink with co-workers while 
traveling with his company, knowing that this conduct has caused him trouble in the past.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am particularly concerned by the Applicant's inability to totally abstain from alcohol use.  He has not had an alcohol-related arrest for over five years.  
However, he still drinks and shows no desire to stop.  In addition, he continues to drive, even though he does not have a current driver's license.  This is clearly 
a pattern, and shows a man who does not think the rules apply to him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the mitigating evidence which shows that he is an outstanding, well-respected and trustworthy employee.  However, people who abuse 
alcohol to excess are unable to state that they can protect classified information 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G (Alcohol abuse), I find the following disqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case:  (1) <EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol abuse</EM>; (4) <EM>evaluation of alcohol abuse 
or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>; and (5) <EM>habitual or binge 
consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>.  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply since the Applicants history of drunk driving arrests shows 
a pattern (1), I do not believe there are positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (3), and while he does have a positive diagnosis (Government Exhibit 
9), he has not abstained from alcohol use for at least 12 months nor does he attend Alcoholics Anonymous or other support groups.  Paragraph 1 is found 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to the Criminal Conduct allegations.  The Applicant's six convictions bring him under the purview of Disqualifying Conditions (1) <EM>allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM> and (2) <EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's six convictions for Driving Under the Influence are a pattern of offenses over a 20 year period.  Since he continues to drink, and he continues 
to drive despite the fact he has a life-long suspension in State A and no driver's license in State B, I cannot find there is clear evidence of rehabilitation(6).  His 
conduct is not isolated (2) and, under the particular facts of this case, I cannot find that it was not recent (1).  Accordingly, I cannot find that any of the 
itigating Conditions under Guideline J are present.  Paragraph 2 is also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's contributions to the defense effort have been noted and considered.  In addition, I have considered the positive recommendations of his co-workers.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons. </SPAN></P>
