<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She is a group manager supervising about 100 people for a defense contractor that provides 
support for government information systems.  She has held a security clearance since 1992.  Applicant had two alcohol-related incidents away from work: one

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 26, 2002, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> 
(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On August 23, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its 
decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline G of the Directive, Alcohol Consumption.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR by letter dated September 20, 2004.  Applicant elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge, but was reassigned to me on February 10, 2005.  With the concurrence of the parties, I 
conducted the hearing on March 8, 2005.  The department counsel introduced five exhibits.  Applicant's counsel presented documents admitted as Exhibits A 
and B, and Applicant testified on her own behalf.  Upon the request of Applicant's counsel, I left the record open to allow the submission of additional matters.  
On March 21, 2005, Applicant submitted a document, without objection, which I admitted as Exhibit C.  I took official notice of the pertinent sections of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), without objection, and included those portions as Board 
Exhibit I.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 18, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations in &para; 1.a of the SOR.  Answer to SOR, dated September 20, 2004, at 1.  She<STRONG> </STRONG>admitted the remaining factual allegations in the 
SOR, with explanations.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1-2.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 58 years old.  Ex. 3 at 1.  She works as a group manager supervising over 100 people for a defense contractor that provides support for government 
information systems.  <EM>Id.; </EM>Ex. C at 2<EM>.  </EM>Her supervisor feels she is a woman of the highest integrity who is scrupulously honest.  Ex. C at 2.  She has worked for 
defense contractors since about 1991 and has held a security clearance since about 1992.  Ex. 3 at 1-3.  She seeks renewal of her security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking alcohol in about 1967, when she was about 21 years old.  Ex. 5 at 3.  She normally consumed alcohol about once a month, when she 
was out to dinner or socializing with friends.  <EM>Id.</EM>  She usually drank one glass of wine with dinner.  <EM>Id.</EM>  On unusual occasions (about once a year) she would 
have more than one drink.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1995, Applicant went out with a friend after work.  Applicant had just learned that her aunt was dying and she was very upset.  Ex. 5 at 1.  She 
had about three mixed drinks.  Tr. at 54.  The local police stopped Applicant while she was driving home.  Ex. 1 at 12.  Test results revealed that she had a 
blood-alcohol concentration of .12%-above the legal limit in that jurisdiction.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Local authorities cited Applicant for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a gross misdemeanor in that jurisdiction.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The court 
deferred prosecution to pursue an alternate disposition.  Ex. 3 at 9.  Applicant attended Alcohol Information School and the Victim's Panel, paid court costs and 
fees, and participated in an alcohol assessment, as ordered by the court.  Ex. 3 at 11.  Thereafter, the court amended the charge to negligent driving.  Ex. 3 at 4, 
11.  Applicant pled guilty and was found guilty of the lesser charge.  Ex. 3 at 11, 12.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2002, Applicant went out with a friend.  Applicant's friend had just learned that she was dying of cancer and had only a few weeks to live.  Ex. 5 at 
2.  They each had several drinks.  <EM>Id.  </EM>Applicant began to drive home.  On the way, she fell asleep and drove off the road.  Ex. 2 at 4.  Her vehicle traveled over 
a raised curb and got stuck.  <EM>Id.</EM>  A passing motorist called the local police, who responded to the scene.  The police officer gave her a field sobriety test and a 
breath test.  Applicant's blood-alcohol concentration was .12%.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4, 5.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Authorities charged her with driving under the influence of alcohol.  Ex. 2 at 1, 5; Ex. 3 at 5.  Applicant entered into a pretrial diversion agreement with 
prosecutors.  Ex. 2 at 6.  The prosecution agreed to dismiss the charges with prejudice after two years, provided Applicant satisfied certain conditions, including 
payment of $500.00 court costs, making a $100.00 contribution to Mother's Against Drunk Driving, submitting to a chemical dependency evaluation and 
complying with all treatment recommendations, attending a DUI victim's panel, and not driving any vehicle with more than .03% blood-alcohol concentration.  
Ex. 2 at 8-10.  Applicant complied with all the requirements of the pretrial diversion agreement, including attending a recommended outpatient alcohol 
treatment program and abstaining from alcohol use for one year.  The government dismissed the charge with prejudice in February 2004.  Ex. A.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As part of the court-ordered diversion program, Applicant submitted to an evaluation at an alcohol and drug abuse treatment center.  Ex. 4.  The counselor 
administered two psychological tests-both indicated Applicant had no significant problem with either alcohol or drugs.  Ex. 4 at 3.  The counselor determined 
Applicant was not alcohol dependent.  Ex. 4 at 4.  The counselor's evaluation was Alcohol Abuse, under the DSM-IV, &sect; 305.00, apparently based upon the fact 
that Applicant had a previous alcohol-related conviction in 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After the initiation of this action, Applicant obtained an independent evaluation on January 5, 2005.  Ex. B at 1.  Her evaluator is a licensed clinical social 
worker who is the executive director of an alcohol and drug treatment clinic that conducts forensic assessments for criminal and family law cases.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.  A 
battery of psychological tests did not indicate chemical dependency or symptoms of substance abuse.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.  The evaluator's diagnosis was that Applicant did 
not meet the criteria for Alcohol Dependence or Alcohol Abuse.  He explained:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If one follows the clinical guidelines for substance abuse in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) such a 
diagnosis requires <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">recurrent</SPAN> substance abuse legal problems within a 12 month period of time or other significant interference in her ability to fulfill her major 
life obligations.  In my clinical estimation [Applicant] did not meet such criteria in 2002 and certainly does not at this time in her life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DSM-IV-TR, &sect; 305, indicates that the criteria for diagnosing Alcohol Abuse are the same as for Substance Abuse.  According to the DSM-IV-TR, "The 
essential feature of Substance Abuse is a maladaptive pattern of substance use manifested by recurrent and significant adverse consequences related to the 
repeated use of substances."  DSM-IV-TR, at 198.  Alcohol Abuse may only be diagnosed once the absence of Alcohol Dependence has been established.  <EM>See</EM> 
DSM-IV-TR, &sect; 303.  According to the DSM-IV-TR at 199, the diagnostic criteria for Substance Abuse are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following, occurring 
within a 12-month period:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance 
related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance 
use)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g. arrests for substance-related disorderly conduct)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substances (e.g., 
arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B.  The symptoms have never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for this class of substance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM> <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A7.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if the evidence reveals "Alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use.<EM>"</EM>  </SPAN>The evidence shows two 
instances where Applicant drove under the influence of alcohol away from work: one in 1995 and one in 2002.  I conclude this potentially disqualifying 
condition applies.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.2.4 of the Directive, an "[e]valuation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program" is potentially disqualifying.  The parties agreed that the evaluation completed in 2002 was done by a licensed clinical 
social worker on the staff of a treatment center approved by the local courts and that the counselor diagnosed Alcohol Abuse.  However, Applicant's counsel 
challenges the correctness of the diagnosis.  The DSM-IV-TR (Bd. Ex. I) makes it clear that Alcohol Abuse may only be diagnosed where there are multiple 
incidents meeting the criteria within a 12-month period.  The DSM-IV-TR specifically states the "essential feature" of Alcohol Abuse is a "maladaptive <EM>pattern</EM> 
of substance use manifested by <EM>recurrent</EM> and significant adverse consequences related to the <EM>repeated </EM>use of substances."  Bd. Ex. I at 198 (emphasis added).  
The diagnostic criteria requires that there be "recurrent" substance abuse within a 12-month period.  The available evidence shows one instance of driving under 
the influence of alcohol in 1995 and another in 2002.  The evaluation in 2002 (Ex. 4) does not reflect a factual basis for the finding of alcohol abuse.  The more 
recent evaluation (Ex. B) accurately reports and applies the criteria, and concludes there is an insufficient basis to diagnose Alcohol Abuse.  I conclude the 
evidence is insufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, under &para; E2.A7.1.2.6 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where there is evidence of "[c]onsumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of 
alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program."  Paragraph 1.f of the SOR alleges Applicant 
continues "to consume alcohol notwithstanding your treatment for alcohol abuse."  It is important to note the distinction between alcoholism (also known as 
alcohol dependence) and alcohol abuse.  Applicant was not diagnosed as being an alcoholic or alcohol dependent.  Indeed, in order to make a diagnosis of 
Alcohol Abuse, practitioners had to rule out a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence.  Applicant was never diagnosed as an alcoholic or alcohol dependent, nor were 
any diagnoses made by a credentialed medical professional, therefore this potentially disqualifying condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from Applicant's alcohol consumption can be mitigated under certain circumstances.  Under the Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.3.1, it may 
be mitigating where "[t]he alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern."  The alcohol-related incidents in this case were separated by about seven years, 
therefore they do not show a pattern.  Applicant's evidence persuades me that this potentially mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.3.2 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "[t]he problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem."  
Applicant's first alcohol-related incident occurred in 1995, which was a number of years ago.  I am unable to find that there is no indication of a recent problem, 
however.  Applicant's most recent alcohol-related incident occurred in 2002.  At the time Applicant submitted this application for a security clearance, the 
charges were still pending, awaiting Applicant's completion of the requirements of the diversion agreement.  This mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A7.1.3.3 provides that "[p]ositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety" may also be a mitigating factor.  Following her alcohol-related 
incident in 2002, Applicant attended court-ordered evaluation, and completed an alcohol rehabilitation course.  She gained increased awareness of the dangers 
of drinking and driving.  Although Applicant still drinks alcohol on occasion, she is careful not to drink and drive.  I find this potentially mitigating condition 
applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.3.4 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where, </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[f]ollowing diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with 
aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at 
least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, Applicant was diagnosed as an Alcohol Abuser (although it was incorrect, as discussed above), successfully completed outpatient rehabilitation, 
and abstained from alcohol for a one year period.  However, she does not participate frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, 
therefore this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature individual who has successfully 
held a position of responsibility for many years.  She has held a security clearance since 1992.  Her record of two alcohol-related incidents are the only 
blemishes on her otherwise excellent record of performance and service.  The incidents were separated by about seven years.  The available evidence indicates 
these incidents occurred during unusual periods of great emotional stress, rather than regularly occurring conduct.  I am persuaded Applicant recognizes the 
seriousness of her position, and realizes that one more incident could have dire consequences.  I am convinced Applicant has made long-term behavioral 
changes, and such problems will not recur.   I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her personal conduct.</SPAN></P>
