  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  The Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a written statement he gave to a federal investigator in March 2003 is sustainable.  Applicant's ability to cite favorable record evidence does not demonstrate the  Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The security significance of Applicant's acts  of dishonesty and falsification do not turn on whether an unfavorable security clearance decision will have an adverse effect on his personal  situation.  An unfavorable security clearance decision means that Applicant is not eligible to hold a security clearance at any level.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 10, 2004, which stated 
the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated December 17, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a written 
statement he gave to a federal investigator; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision lacks a rational basis.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a written statement he gave to a federal investigator</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge found that Applicant: (a) falsified three applications for employment by claiming he had a college degree that he did not 
actually receive; and (b) falsified a written statement he gave to a federal investigator in March 2003 by claiming that he had only falsified a 
single application.  Applicant does not challenge the Judge's finding that he falsified three applications for employment.<A HREF="03-18181.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  However, 
Applicant asserts that he was truthful with the federal government about not having a college degree.  The Board construes Applicant's 
assertion as raising the issue of whether the Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a written statement he gave to a federal investigator.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's assertion about not falsely claiming a college degree when he completed a security clearance application in October 2002 is 
irrelevant to whether the Administrative Judge could find that he falsified a written statement he gave to a federal investigator in March 2003.  
The SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified the security clearance application.  The Judge did not find Applicant falsified the security 
clearance application.  It is legally and logically possible for the Judge to find Applicant was untruthful when he gave the written statement to 
an investigator in March 2003 despite the absence of any evidence that he falsified the security clearance application.  Moreover, the Judge 
did not find that Applicant falsified the written statement by claiming he had a college degree.  Rather, the Judge found that Applicant 
falsified the written statement by claiming that he had falsified only one employment application, when he had falsified three employment 
applications.</P> 
 
<P>Considering the record as a whole, the Administrative Judge had sufficient record evidence to find that Applicant falsified a written statement 
in March 2003 by claiming that he had only falsified one employment application.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision lacks a rational basis</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant argues: (a) he has not had a security 
violation; (b) he is not vulnerable to blackmail or coercion; (c) his employment history shows that he exhibits good judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness; (d) he has the respect of his professional colleagues; (e) a favorable decision would allow him to keep his job and support his 
family; and (f) he would like to be allowed to retain a Secret clearance.<A HREF="03-18181.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether 
the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision lacks a rational basis.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  
<EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  The federal government is not required to wait until an applicant commits a security 
violation before it can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 
397 U.S. 139 (1970).  Nor is the federal government  required to wait until there is evidence that an applicant is vulnerable to coercion or 
blackmail before it can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-02892 (June 28, 2004) at p. 10.  All that 
is required is proof of conduct or circumstances that indicate an applicant does not exhibit the high degree of judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness required of persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-17007 (June 16, 2004) at p. 4.  
Accordingly, the absence of security violations by Applicant, and the absence of any finding by the Administrative Judge that  Applicant is 
vulnerable to coercion or blackmail, did not preclude the Judge from making an unfavorable security clearance decision.  The Judge's 
findings of Applicant's dishonesty and falsification provide a rational and legally sufficient basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about 
Applicant's security eligibility.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's ability to cite to favorable record evidence does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  The Judge must consider the 
record evidence as a whole, decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>, and reach a reasoned 
conclusion as to whether Applicant satisfied his burden of persuasion that a favorable security clearance decision is warranted in light of the 
record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-20947 (June 18, 2004) at p. 5.  Considering the record as a whole, Applicant has not 
demonstrated that the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, or that the Judge reached 
conclusions that are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. </P> 
 
<P>The possible adverse effect that an unfavorable security clearance decision might have on Applicant is not relevant to the Administrative 
Judge's determination as to Applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (May 19, 2004) at p. 8.  The security 
significance of Applicant's acts of dishonesty and falsification do not turn on whether an unfavorable security clearance decision will have an 
adverse effect on his personal situation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's request that he be allowed to retain a Secret clearance cannot be granted.  An unfavorable security clearance decision means that 
Applicant is not eligible to hold a security clearance at any level.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section 3.2.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0260 (April 12, 
2000) at p. 4.</P>
