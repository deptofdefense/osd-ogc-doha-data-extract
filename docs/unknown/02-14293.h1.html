<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On August 11, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-14293.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-14293.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 20 February 2003, and requested that 
his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 29, 2003. The FORM 
contained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  By letter dated December 30, 2003, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant and he was 
instructed to file any objections or to supply additional information for consideration by an administrative judge within 30 days.  He received the FORM on 
January 12, 2004.  A response was due on February 11, 2004.  Applicant did not submit any information within the time period of 30 days after receiving a copy 
of the FORM.  On February 24, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  Applicant admitted all 12 allegations.  His admissions 
are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42-years old, married, and the father of two children.  He is employed as a junior designer by a defense contractor.  He has worked for his present 
employer since September 2000.  Applicant's security clearance application (SF-86) shows he was unemployed from February 1996 to December 1999, and 
from April to September 2000.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the debts identified in the SOR at 1.a., 1.e., 1.f., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k. were incurred 
from February 1996 through December 1999, and the debts identified in the SOR at 1.f. and 1.g. were incurred in April and May 1999.  He stated further that 
the debts identified in the SOR at 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.h. were incurred from September 2000 to October 2001.  The total amount of the debts alleged in the 
SOR is $4,609.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his signed sworn statement, executed April 8, 2002, Applicant acknowledged five of the debts later alleged in the SOR and also acknowledged approximately 
$7,500 in additional debts.<A HREF="02-14293.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He provided a statement showing his monthly income and expenses and stated that he could not afford to make payments on his debts.  He also stated that he 
had not been in recent contact with his creditors but hoped at some unspecified time in the future to pay or settle his debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From March 1996 to September 1996, Applicant underwent a medical procedure in preparation for donating one of his kidneys to a cousin.  From November 
1997 to December 1999, he attended a vocational school and obtained a degree in drafting and design.  During this time, he held a part-time job.  Applicant's 
wife was laid off twice from her work during the period September 2000 to October 2001.  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may  try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, 
and his financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts, conditions which raise security concerns under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and 
E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 
2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent accounts (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.h.); accounts charged off as bad debts (&para;&para; 1.i., 1.j,. and 1.k.); and an account 
placed in collection (&para; 1.l.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through the FORM and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant 
provided no persuasive evidence to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. 
of Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts, many of which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor 
mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  Applicant was unemployed between February 1996 and December 1999.  Sometime during this period, he donated 
one of his kidneys to a cousin.  His wife suffered two job layoff between September 2000 and October 2001. The unemployment and job layoffs would appear 
to be beyond the Applicant's control, and thus mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not sought counseling for his financial problems, and he submits no persuasive evidence that he has developed and implemented a practical and 
comprehensive plan for resolving his indebtedness.  He has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue debts.  Thus mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.4. 
and E2.A6.1.3.6 do not apply.  Accordingly, the allegations are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board stated that an administrative judge, in deciding an applicant's security worthiness, 
"must consider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>."  I 
have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive, and I conclude that Applicant 
has not successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
