  Because of red ink across certain words in the Administrative Judge's findings of fact, the Board doubts whether it knows with confidence what the Judge found with respect to Applicant's description of financial situation on his security clearance application.  In light of the ambiguity, the Board remands the  case for the Judge to issue a clean decision which is unambiguous in its findings.  Case remanded with instructions. </P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 17, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 23, 2005, after the 
hearing, Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive 
&para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge assured Applicant that if he complied with certain conditions she would 
conclude he should be granted a clearance; whether the Administrative Judge had a basis to conclude that Applicant's description of his  financial situation in 
his security clearance application constituted a deliberate falsification; and whether Applicant had demonstrated sufficient mitigation of his financial problems 
that the Judge was required to conclude that Applicant's financial history was mitigated .</P> 
<P>Before addressing any of the issues raised by Applicant, the Board must address a threshold issue.  On page 2 of the Administrative Judge's decision in the case 
record there is red ink across certain words in the Judge's findings of fact.  The red ink leads the Board to doubt whether it knows with confidence what the 
Judge found with respect to Applicant's description of his financial situation on his security clearance application.  In light of the ambiguity, the Board remands 
the case for the Judge to issue a clean decision which is unambiguous in its findings.</P> 
<P>Given the remand it is premature for the Board to address issues raised by Applicant on appeal.</P>
