<P>Applicant has delinquent debts to eight creditors totaling about $17,624.00, including a child-support arrearage of $2,112.00.  The security concern based on the 
child-support arrearage is mitigated, but the concern based on the remaining debts is neither rebutted nor mitigated.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), based on eight delinquent debts totaling 
more than $24,000.00, including about $8,797.00 in child support arrearage. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 2, 2004.  He admitted four debts (SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.g.) and denied four, including the child support 
(&para;&para; 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.h.).  He requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2004.  On October 13, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing setting the case for November 3, 2004.  The case was heard as scheduled.  I kept the record open for 15 days to permit Applicant to submit documentary 
evidence that his debts were resolved, but he submitted nothing.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 17, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 30-year-old senior security technician for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his present employer since September 1999.  He received a 
secret clearance in March 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married in 1992.  He and his wife were divorced and then remarried in 1998.  Their daughter was born in November 1998.  Applicant and his 
wife separated in 2002 and were divorced in December 2003 (Tr. 26), and Applicant was required to pay $1,000.00 per month in child support (Government 
Exhibit 2, p. 5).  The amount was later adjusted to $1,119.67 per month (Tr. 27).  Applicant married his current wife shortly after the divorce.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's annual gross income is about $75,000.00.  After taxes and deductions, including child support, his monthly take-home pay is about $2,200.00.  His 
wife's monthly take-home pay is about $1,200.00.  He has about $500.00 in his checking account, no savings, and no investments.  His monthly rent is $720.00 
per month, and his monthly car payment is $145.00.  He no longer has any credit cards.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not take any action to resolve his delinquent debts until he was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2003.  He contacted a consumer 
counseling firm, but he could not afford the payments they required (Tr. 34).  He has not contacted any creditors directly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied owing the credit card debt alleged in the SOR &para; 1.a. and reflected on his credit report.  He asserted he did not know what it was, but he has 
never challenged any of the information on his credit report (Tr. 48).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied owing the credit card debt alleged in the SOR &para; .1.d.  At the hearing he asserted it was settled it for a lesser amount (Tr. 38, 50), but he 
presented no documentary evidence to support his testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant denied he owed $8,797.00 in child support, the amount alleged in the SOR &para; 1.f.  He asserted his federal income tax refund was 
applied against the arrearage.  His credit report and his admission at the hearing establish an arrearage of about $2,112.00 (Tr. 31; Government Exhibit 5, p. 2).  
Child support payments are deducted from Applicant's pay (Applicant's Exhibit A).  A portion of the amount deducted is applied to the arrearage (Tr. 59).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that the government debt alleged in the SOR &para; 1.h. had been satisfied from his federal income tax return in 1999 or 2000.  He presented no 
documentary evidence to support his testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline F could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 
applies where an applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the debts alleged in the SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.g.  His admissions are consistent with his credit reports.  He has admitted a child 
support arrearage of about $2,112.00, and his credit report supports that amount. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude DC 1 and DC 3 have been established.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-9020, <EM>supra</EM> at *5, quoting ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant is making regular child support 
payments, including the arrearage, through automatic payroll deductions.  I conclude MC 6 is established, and the security concern based on the child support 
arrearage (SOR &para;1.f.) is mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disputed the credit card debt alleged in the SOR &para; 1.a., but he has done nothing to resolve it or contest it.  He asserted the debt alleged in the SOR &para; 
1.d. was settled, but he provided no documentation, even though he was give additional time after the hearing to obtain and submit such documentation. He has 
disputed the government debt alleged in the SOR &para; 1.h., asserting it was paid by application of his federal income tax refund, but again he submitted no 
documentation to support his assertion.  I conclude he has neither rebutted nor mitigated the security concerns based on these three debts.  Viewing Applicant's 
financial situation as a whole and his lack of attention to resolving it, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns based on his financial history and 
current financial status.</SPAN></P>
