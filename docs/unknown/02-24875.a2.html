<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April 2, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 13, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan 
etz, Jr. denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  On March 29, 2006, the Appeal Board remanded the case to the Administrative Judge.  On May 
5, 2006, the Administrative Judge issued a new decision which again denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to 
the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in taking administrative notice of <EM>U.S. Department of State, Country 
Reports on Human Rights 2000: Laos, dated February 23, 2001</EM>; whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under 
Guideline B had not been mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>(1) Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge erred in taking administrative notice of <EM>U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights 
2000: Laos, dated February 23, 2001</EM>.<A HREF="02-24875.a2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that the document was irrelevant.<A HREF="02-24875.a2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board does not find this 
argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In DOHA proceedings, the Federal Rules of evidence serve only as a guide.  They  may be relaxed by the Administrative Judge (with one exception not 
applicable to this appeal<A HREF="02-24875.a2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>) in order to permit the development of a full and complete record by the parties.  Directive &para; E3.1.19.  In this regard, the Board has 
previously noted that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, 
e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) citing </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service,</EM> 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After reviewing the document at issue, the Board concludes that the Judge reasonably acted within his discretion in taking administrative notice of it.  The 
document was an official U.S. Government report and it was relevant to the issues presented in the case.  The document was provided in advance to the 
Applicant as part of the discovery process of the case, so Applicant had an appropriate opportunity to rebut its contents, or present any alternative information 
for the Judge to notice.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant argues that the evidence she provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Administrative Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, 
that she had rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations.  Specifically, Applicant contends 
that the Judge's adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="02-24875.a2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 3,<A HREF="02-24875.a2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and made an 
unfavorable decision that is unsupported by the record as a whole.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) four of Applicant's siblings are citizens and residents of Laos, (2) Applicant maintains 
regular contact with her siblings in Laos, and returned to Laos in 1989, 1993, 1994, 2001, and 2004 to visit them, (3) these visits typically ran 2-5 weeks, (4) 
three of Applicant's siblings in Laos are employed by the Laotian government, one as a diplomat in the Laotian foreign service, (5) one sibling retired from 
government service, (6) Applicant speaks by telephone with one of her sisters in Laos several times a month, (7) Laos is an authoritarian, Communist, one-party 
state with a poor human rights record, where Government officials use arbitrary arrest, detention, and intrusive surveillance, and (8) the government of Laos 
infringes privacy rights, possesses a vast surveillance network, and its security laws allow it to monitor individual's communications and movements.  Given 
those findings, the Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with her family members in Laos raised security concerns under Guideline B, and that 
Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3 applied.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  If there are admitted or proven facts and 
circumstances that raise security concerns, "[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." 
Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3.  She also argues that the Judge gave 
insufficient weight to evidence that Applicant has lived in, and been a citizen of, the United States for many years, and has extensive ties to this country.  
Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge has to weigh the evidence 
as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing 
of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record in this case, it was not arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met her burden of 
demonstrating that her contacts with her family members in Laos were casual and infrequent, and that her family members were not in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the U.S.  A review of the Judge's decision indicates 
that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible 
application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or factors 
and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  
The Judge was not required, as a matter of law, to favorably apply Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3, and the Judge's overall adverse security 
clearance decision is sustainable.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant incorporates the issues from his first appeal, but also argues that the Board or the parties cannot know what the Administrative Judge was actually looking at when he took 
administrative notice, since the document provided was printed at a later date than the one offered by Department Counsel.  The Board concludes that this error is harmless, in this instance, 
because the document in question is a reproduction of an official document from an official web-site.  However, Applicant's concern underscores why it is important for the Administrative 
Judge to keep an evidentiary record  with copies of all documents or exhibits that are identified or discussed on the record at the hearing, so that the Board or other body can have a complete 
and accurate record for its review. 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On appeal, Applicant also argues that the document was outdated.  However, Applicant did not challenge the document for that reason at the hearing, so the Board need not address it at this
