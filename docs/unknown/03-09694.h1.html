<P>Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on security clearance applications he completed and signed on September 19, 1996 and July 10, 2002.  In an 
interview with an authorized investigator in September 2004, he deliberately provided false or misleading information about his drug use, number of arrests, 
and use of his office e-mail system to send unauthorized e-mails that could be considered offensive.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under 
Guidelines E and J of the Directive.  Clearance is denied.</P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></EM></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On January 14, 2005, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-09694.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-09694.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 
7, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On January 10, 2006, the Government moved to amend the SOR and served a copy of 
the motion on Applicant's counsel on January 11, 2006.  On May 18, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 14, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  At the hearing, the Government's motion to amend the SOR was granted without objection.  The Government called one witness and submitted ten 
exhibits (Ex.), which were identified as Ex. 1 through 10.  With the exception of Ex. 8, the Government's exhibits were admitted without objection.  Ex. 8 was 
admitted over Applicant's objection. Applicant called one witness and submitted one exhibit, identified as Ex. A.  The Government cited subparagraph E3.1.17 
of the Directive and objected to the admission of Ex. A because it had not been provided to Department Counsel prior to its submission by Applicant's counsel 
at the hearing. I granted the Government's objection and continued the hearing to allow time to cure the surprise. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 20, 2006, I reconvened the hearing.  Applicant called one witness and submitted three exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A, B, and C and 
admitted without objection.  At the conclusion of Applicant's case, the Government called one rebuttal witness.  On July 25, 2006, DOHA received the 
transcript of the July 14 hearing. (Tr. I.)   On September 29, 2006, DOHA received the transcript (Tr. II.) of the September 20 hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The amended SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct.<A HREF="03-09694.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Eight allegations relate to conduct alleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and 
four allegations relate to conduct alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his January 14, 2006 response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations 
at &para;&para; 1.a(1), 1.b(1), 1.c., 1.d., and 2.a.  He admitted the allegation at &para; 1.e. Applicant responded to the additional allegations in the amended SOR at his hearing. 
His admission is incorporated as a finding of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time of his hearing, Applicant was 52 years old and employed as a manager by a government contractor.  He and his wife have been married for 20 years.  
They have no children.  (Ex. 1; Tr. I, 93; Tr. II, 72, 81-82.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in a small town.  At the age of twelve, he began to work for his father and subsequently became an electrician.  He graduated 
from high school in 1971 and remained in his home town.  ( Tr. I, 85-86.)</P> 
 
<P>In the summer of 1974, Applicant was arrested and charged with indecent exposure.  He was convicted and received a sentence of two years in jail.  His 
sentence was suspended; Applicant paid a fine and court costs; and he was ordered to obtain treatment at a mental health center.  (Ex. 5 at 3.)  Applicant 
asserted his arrest occurred after he and several friends were caught swimming naked at a local quarry.  He said he was charged because he was the driver of the 
truck that had carried his friends to the quarry. (Tr. I, 86-88. Tr. II 68-70.)</P> 
 
<P>In February 1980, Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal trespass when he entered a junior high school several times without authorization.  The 
police report alleged that on one of these occasions, Applicant had a camera and asked a female student to take a shower so he could take her photograph with 
his camera. Applicant denied the allegation and asserted he went to the school to apply for a job as an electrician.  The person in charge of maintenance for the 
junior high school stated Applicant never came to him to apply for a job, and he further stated that all hiring for jobs at the junior high school was done not at 
the school but at a business office in the town.  Applicant appeared before a magistrate, posted $1,000 bail, pled guilty to a reduced charge, and paid a fine and 
court costs.  (Ex. 7, 1-18; Tr. II,  60-64.)   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his wife were married in 1986.  He continued to work as an electrician, and, in 1991 or 1992, he accepted an overseas assignment.   He returned 
from the overseas assignment in about August 1992.  Applicant testified his wife met him at the airport and they went to a hotel for the weekend.<A HREF="03-09694.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  There was a 
swimming pool at the hotel.  Applicant went to the swimming pool several times.  His wife testified she was with him at the swimming pool, but was not with 
him the entire time they were at the hotel. While Applicant and his wife were at the hotel, police came and placed applicant under arrest.  He was charged with 
Indecent Liberties with a Child, a felony offense.  The charge was later <EM>nolle prosequi.</EM> (Ex. 1; Ex. 5; Ex. 6; Tr. I, 93-95; Tr. II, 73-75.) </P> 
 
<P>After returning from the overseas assignment, Applicant decided he no longer wished to work as an electrician.  He moved back to his home state, lived with 
his mother, studied computer science,  and became a network engineer.  His first job as a network engineer was with Employer A.  He then transferred with 
several co-workers and went to work for Employer B, where he was employed for approximately two years.  In September 1997, Applicant sent e-mails 
containing four-letter vulgarities associated with sex to female co-workers. (Ex. 9; Ex. 10.)  One of his co-workers appeared on his behalf and testified she did 
not find the e-mails offensive, although she acknowledged that other co-workers or their managers might have found the communications offensive or 
inappropriate in the workplace.  (Tr. I, 127-128, 133-135.)  On September 22, 1997, Applicant was terminated for cause by Employer B and not recommended 
for rehire.  (Ex. 8; Tr. II at 97-98.)  The following notation was made by Employer B in Applicant's personal file:</P> 
 
<P>[Applicant] was a good technical resource who never learned how to work in a professional environment.  His general arrogance, disregard for proper 
procedures, rejection of any authority, occasional vulgar comments to women, abuse of professional personal leave practices all created a very difficult 
environment to properly regard his technical contributions.  His unacceptable behavior had a long history but was overlooked while the project did not have any 
replacement should he leave.  Bottom line - never acclimated to the professional business world of [Employer B]. </P> 
 
<P>(Ex. 8 at 3.)</P> 
 
<P>At his hearing, Applicant submitted documents that he claimed showed the managers at Employer B treated him unfairly.  (Ex. A, Ex. B, and Ex. C.)  The 
testimony of the Government's rebuttal witness supported the record statements of Employer B's managers.  (Tr. II, 84-99.)</P> 
 
<P>From approximately 2000 to 2002, Applicant worked for Employer C, where he was tasked with supervision of at least one employee.  Applicant concluded an 
employee he supervised was not doing a good job. He notified the employee three times of her deficiencies. He asked her to take a lower position, and the 
employee complained to Employer C's human resources department.  Applicant's employer investigated the matter and gave Applicant a verbal warning about 
his abrasive management style.  Not long afterwards, Employer C found it necessary to downsize and to lay off 7,000 employees from its national workforce.  
Applicant was laid off and received a severance package.  (Ex. 4 at 1-2; Tr. II, 32-38.) </P> 
 
<P>During the years  1972, 1973, and 1974, Applicant  used cocaine six times, LSD two times, and  Valium about six times. He began using marijuana in 1970, 
and he smoked it daily until 1972. Between 1972 and 1974, he smoked marijuana about twice a week and attempted to grow marijuana.  Between 1974 and 
1987, he smoked marijuana one or two times a month.  Between 1987 and 1999, he used marijuana about 12 times. Applicant used marijuana from July 1995 to 
at least 1999.  Applicant claimed his last use of marijuana was in 1999.  In late 2001 or early 2002, he was with a group of people who were smoking marijuana 
in an automobile. Applicant stated he did not smoke the marijuana cigarette when it was passed to him.  (Ex. 3 at 1-2.)</P> 
 
<P>On September 19, 1996, Applicant completed a security clearance application identified as a Standard Form 85P (SF-85P).  Question 20 on the SF-85P reads as 
follows:  "In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)?  (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.)" Applicant 
answered "no" to Question 20.  (Ex. 2.)  After completing the SF-85P, Applicant signed the following certification: "My statements on this form, and any 
attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful 
false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)"</P> 
 
<P>On July 7, 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application identified as a Standard Form 86 (SF-86).  Question 20 on the SF-86 asks if an applicant 
has, in the past seven years, been fired from a job, quit a job after being told he or she would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of 
misconduct, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or left a job for some other reason under unfavorable 
circumstances.  Applicant answered "no" to Question 20.</P> 
 
<P>Question 21 on the SF-86 asks an applicant if he or she has ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense.  Applicant answered "no" to Question 
21.  Question 27 on the SF-86  reads as follows: "Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled 
substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants 
(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 27 on the SF-86.  At his hearing, Applicant explained his answer to Question 27 as follows:  "I don't believe that touching a marijuana cigarette once or twice a year is 
possession.  And I didn't believe that one or two puffs off a marijuana cigarette, you know, determined use." (Tr. II at 31-32.)</P> 
 
<P>On July 10, 2002, after completing the SF-86, Applicant signed the following certification:</P> 
 
<P>My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of title 18, United 
States Code). </P> 
 
<P>On September 16, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the DSS.  Applicant stated he left his job with Employer B by mutual agreement and 
because he had reported one of his supervisors for stealing from the company. (Ex. 4 at 2.)  He also denied sending any e-mail while employed by Employer B 
that "could be considered offensive to any of my coworkers." (Ex. 4 at  2.)</P> 
 
<P>   Also at the interview, Applicant discussed his arrest for Indecent Liberties with a Child, but denied he had been arrested for or charged with any other crimes. 
He then recalled his 1974 arrest in which he was charged with and convicted of indecent exposure and provided some details. When reminded by the special 
agent of his obligation to be truthful, pursuant to section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code, Applicant recalled his arrest in 1980 and the subsequent charge 
of criminal trespass.  He provided details. He went on to tell the special agent he had not used or possessed any illegal drugs, to include marijuana, in the last 
seven years.  (Ex. 4 at 4.)  Applicant signed the statement and certified that it was " true, complete and accurate to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and . . 
.  made in good faith."  He further stated he understood that a knowing and willful false statement can be punished, pursuant to Section 1001 of Title 18, United 
States Code, by fine or imprisonment or both.  (Ex. 4 at 4.) </P> 
 
<P>On October 4, 2004, Applicant met again with a special agent and admitted his drug use and possession.  He acknowledged his use of marijuana from 1970 to 
1999.  He also acknowledged past use of cocaine, LSD, and Valium, and he stated he had not used these drugs since 1980.  He stated his last involvement with 
marijuana took place in 2001 or 2002 when he was riding in an automobile with individuals who were smoking marijuana.  (Ex. 3 at 1-2.)  Applicant again 
signed and certified a statement memorializing his admissions as truthful, complete, and accurate to the best of his ability and made in good faith. (Ex. 3 at 1.) </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a 
position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to 
United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, 
honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 
1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the amended  SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, when he falsified material facts in his answer to 
Question 20 on the SF-86 he executed and signed on July 10, 2002, by denying he was terminated from Employer B for disruptive influence, unauthorized or 
excessive absence, and incompatibility with the job, and, further, was not eligible for rehire (&para; 1. a. (1); and that Applicant again falsified material facts in his 
answer to Question 27 on the SF-86 he executed and signed on July 10, 2002, by denying and failing to list illegal drug use in the previous seven years, when 
he knew he had used marijuana with varying frequency from 1995 to 1999 (&para; 2.b.(1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA also alleged in the amended SOR that Applicant raised Guideline E concerns when, on September 19, 1996, he falsified material facts on a SF-85P he 
executed by denying, in his response to Question 20,  he had been arrested, charged, or convicted of any offense in the past seven years, when, in fact, he had 
been arrested for Indecent Liberties with a Child on April 11, 1993 (&para; 1.c.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA alleged that in a signed sworn statement, dated September16, 2004, to an authorized investigator, Applicant falsified material facts by stating he had not 
used any illegal drugs, to include marijuana, in the past seven years and deliberately failed to disclose the marijuana use set forth in paragraph 1.b(1) above (&para; 
1.d.).  DOHA also alleged Applicant received a verbal reprimand in February 2001 from his employer as the result of complaints about his conduct  (&para; 1.e.).  
DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified material facts on the SF-86 he executed on July 10, 2002, by answering "no" to Question 21, which asked if he had ever 
been charged with or convicted of any felony offense, when, in fact, he deliberately failed to list that he had been charged with the felony offense of Indecent 
Exposure on April 11, 1993 (&para; 1.f.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA also alleged in the amended SOR that Applicant falsified material facts in a signed, sworn statement made on September 16, 2004, to an authorized 
DSS investigator by stating that when he worked for Employer B he never sent an e-mail at work that could be considered offensive by any of his co-workers, 
whereas, in fact, on September 17, 1997, and September 18, 1997, he sent e-mails to co-workers that contained four-letter vulgarities related to sex  (&para; 1.g.).  
DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified material facts in an interview with an authorized DSS investigator on about September 16, 2004, when, after being 
questioned about his arrest in 1993, he stated he had not been arrested on any other occasions and, thereafter, after additional questioning and after being 
advised of the applicability of U.S.C. &sect;1001, Applicant revealed his arrest for Criminal Trespass in 1980 and deliberately failed to reveal his arrest for Indecent 
Exposure in 1974  (&para; 1.h.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Reliable unfavorable information about Applicant's 
conduct in the workplace was provided by former employers and co-workers, thus raising a security concern under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.1. 
of  Guideline E. His failure to answer four questions completely, truthfully, and correctly on two security clearance applications raises a security concern under 
DC E2.A5.1.2.2.   His deliberate false statements to investigators in connection with a personal security or trustworthiness determination raise concerns under 
DC E2. A5.1.2.3.   His concealment of information he considered embarrassing or professionally damaging could make him vulnerable to coercion and 
blackmail, thus raising a security concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.4.  Additionally, his conduct raises concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern 
of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests 
before those of the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1. does not apply to the facts of this case: the information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Three other mitigating conditions under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if his falsifications were isolated and not recent, and if he subsequently provided the correct information 
voluntarily. Mitigating Condition (MC) E.2.A.5.1.3.2.  Additionally, if Applicant made prompt good faith efforts to correct the falsifications before being 
confronted with the facts, then MC E2.A5.1.3.3. might apply.  The evidence showed Applicant supplied the correct information only when repeatedly 
questioned by DSS special agents.  His falsifications were multiple, carried out over a period of several years, and continued into the present.  Accordingly, 
neither MC E.2.A.5.1.3.2. nor MC E2.A5.1.3.3. applies to the facts of Applicant's case.  Applicant provided no evidence to show he had reduced or eliminated 
his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and, accordingly, MC E2.A5.1.3.5. is also inapplicable. The Guideline E allegations at &para;&para; 1.a(1), 1.b(1), 
1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h. of the amended SOR are concluded against the Applicant.  Because it was not established that his management style while 
employed by Employer C constituted disqualifying conduct under Guideline E , the allegation at &para; 1.e. of the amended SOR is concluded for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on security clearance applications and in interviews with authorized DSS 
investigators about his employment history, drug use, and criminal activity, and that these deliberate falsifications, as alleged in &para;&para; 1.a(1), 1.b(1), 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 
1.g., and 1.h. constituted felonious conduct pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 (&para; 2.a.).  In the amended SOR, DOHA also alleged Applicant was arrested in April 
1993 and charged with Indecent Liberties with a Child, a felony offense (&para; 2.b.); that he was arrested in February 1980 and charged with Criminal Trespass after 
an investigation revealed he had entered a junior high school without authorization on several occasions and, on one of these occasions, had requested that a 
schoolgirl pose for him in a school locker room shower, and that he had pled guilty to a reduced charge and was sentenced to pay a fine and court costs (&para; 2.c.); 
and that he was arrested in August 1974 for Indecent Exposure, was found guilty, sentenced to two years confinement, ordered to receive mental health 
treatment, and his sentence was suspended. (&para; 2.d.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had a record of criminal conduct that spanned three decades.  In 1996 and 2002, when he completed his two security clearance applications, he 
deliberately failed to report his criminal history.  He then signed his name and certified that his statement was true, complete and correct to the best of his 
knowledge and belief.  Further, he acknowledged his understanding that a false statement on the SF- 85P and the SF-86 could be punished as a felony crime by 
fine or imprisonment under the provisions of Section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code.  Applicant made knowing and willful false statements in his 
responses to Question 20 on his SF-85P and to Questions 20, 21, and 27 on his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 2004, Applicant provided materially false information in a sworn written statement to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service and 
signed his name below the following statement, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I certify that the following statement is true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good faith.  I understand that a 
knowing and willful false statement can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under section Title 18, Section 1001, of the United States Code, it is a felony crime to knowingly make a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement to 
a department or agency of the Federal government.  Applicant prepared and signed a written statement to a lawful investigator in which he lied about his 
employment history, drug use, and criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  &para; E2.A10.1.1. A person 
seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by 
the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of 
persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal behavior raises security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC)  E2. A10.1.2.1 and DC E2.A10.1.2.2 of Guideline J.  He was 
arrested in 1993 and charged with Indecent Liberties with a Child, a felony crime.  He was also arrested in 1974 and convicted of  Indecent Exposure.  In 1980 
he was arrested for Criminal Trespass. Applicant's history of criminal behavior consisted of one felony,  two lesser offenses, and felonious conduct under 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001, making DC E2.A10.1.2.1. and DC E2.A10.1.2.2. applicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal behavior for which Applicant was arrested and charged was not recent, and thus Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 applies.  However, his 
crimes were not isolated incidents, and they suggest a pattern of behavior.  Applicant failed to demonstrate clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  
Accordingly, neither MC E2.A10.1.3.3. nor MC E2.A10.1.3.6. applies.  Additionally, no other mitigating conditions under Guideline J are applicable to the 
facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the Guideline J allegations in the amended SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of evidence and under all the Directive 
guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable to the facts of this case.  I have observed Applicant and assessed his credibility. Under the 
whole person concept, as specified at &para; E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, I conclude Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the Government's case 
opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
