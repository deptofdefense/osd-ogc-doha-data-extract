<P>Applicant's alcohol abuse--punctuated by alcohol-related arrests in December 2002 and October 2003--is mitigated by the passage of three years without recurrence of alcohol-related incidents as well 
as positive lifestyle changes supportive of sobriety. Clearance granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant challenges the 9 November 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of her clearance because of alcohol 
consumption and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 7 December 2005, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 June 2006 and I convened a hearing 3 October 2006. 
DOHA received the transcript 18 October 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the Guideline G (Alcohol) allegations of the SOR except for subparagraph 1.a., denying that she consumed alcohol to excess to March 2005. Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's 
admissions as findings of fact. Applicant--a 35-year-old executive assistant for a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. She has not previously applied for a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consumed alcohol to excess between December 2002 and October 2003. In December 2002, she was arrested and charged with DUI when she blew a .10% B.A.C. after a traffic stop. In May 
2003, as a first-time offender, she negotiated a plea deal to a lesser charge of reckless driving on condition that she pay a $1,500 fine, receive a suspended sentence of 30 days in jail, and complete the 
state alcohol safety action program (ASAP). Having received a light sentence, Applicant squandered the opportunity she had been given to avoid additional legal consequences. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant entered ASAP as required in June 2003, agreeing in writing to the program requirements, including a pledge to consume no alcohol during the 10-week program. During a July 2003 program 
meeting, she reported consuming alcohol the past Friday and Saturday nights. As a result of this breech of the program agreement, Applicant was placed in an intensive alcohol education class in August 
2003. She continued to drink during this program as well. She just stopped reporting her alcohol consumption during the weekly program meetings. In October 2003, she was again arrested and charged 
with DUI, after blowing a .12% B.A.C. She reported this arrest to the counselors at ASAP.       </P> 
 
<P>As a result of the October 2003 DUI, Applicant was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended, fined $400, given a restricted license for 12 months, and again ordered to complete ASAP. But the watershed 
event in Applicant's alcohol history occurred in January 2004, when she received an order to show cause why her suspended sentence from the December 2002 DUI should not be revoked because of 
her failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the suspended sentence. Applicant's suspended sentence was vacated, and she ultimately served 14 days in jail. </P> 
 
<P>The jail time transformed her life. "Going to jail sucks. . . . It's humiliating, it's very humiliating. It will open your eyes . . . to see all the people in there. It just makes you think why did you do this to 
get in this position? Do you really want to do this." (Tr. 26) Determined to never go to jail again, Applicant re-entered  ASAP in February 2004, this time complying strictly with the program 
requirements--including abstention from alcohol, bi-weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, six weeks of program meetings, 36 sessions of outpatient substance abuse group therapy between 
February and May 2004 (with ten urine screen/breathalyzer tests, all negative), and ongoing monitoring until January 2005. Applicant satisfactorily completed all the program requirements.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's two DUIs occurred when she was married, and a principal activity was drinking while out with her husband and his friends. She has since divorced him and now spends her free time in 
activities that do not involve drinking. She works out regularly at her gym, and plays team sports. She consumed no alcohol for about a year after her October 2003 DUI. Since then, she has had a glass 
of wine on special occasions, no more than once a month. When she was drinking more heavily, she drank beer and spirits as well as wine.</P> 
 
<P>Her character references, including her company supervisors as well as the government agency employees for whom she works, consider her an honest and trustworthy employee. They observe no 
evidence of continued alcohol abuse.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G by demonstrating Applicant's two DUI convictions within a 10-month period.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> However, the alcohol abuse is mitigated. The 
two convictions were confined to a 10-month period when she was married and a principal social activity was hanging out with her husband and his friends and drinking. The arrests themselves did not 
indicate a pattern of abuse.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> She has had no alcohol-related arrests since her October 2003 DUI.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Since her divorce and her completion of program requirements, she no longer associates with those 
friends and has found other activities that do not involve drinking.<A HREF="05-04237.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Although her alcohol consumption never affected her work, several of her references noted even better performance after she 
substantially reduced her alcohol consumption. She has never been evaluated as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser. She recognizes the importance of a sober lifestyle for both her job and 
clearance. I conclude that she is unlikely to return to abusive levels of drinking. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline G for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
