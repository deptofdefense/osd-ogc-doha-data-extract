<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a 
security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant responded to the SOR on October 21, 2003, and he requested a clearance decision 
based on a written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>On March 24, 2004, Department Counsel prepared and submitted her written case. The File of Relevant Material (FORM)<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> was mailed to Applicant on or about 
arch 29, 2004, and it was received by Applicant on April 15, 2004. Applicant submitted information within the 30-day period after receipt of the FORM. On 
ay 6, 2004, Department Counsel indicated she had no objection to Applicant's response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2004. Issuing 
a decision in this case was delayed due a heavy caseload.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the record, I make the following 
essential findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a federal contractor; his position or title is described as passenger/gate agent. He married in January 2002. He is 
currently working overseas for the company in support of U.S. military operations. He has worked for this company since June 25, 2001, and is seeking a 
security clearance for that employment. In February 2004, Applicant received a certificate of appreciation for a job well done from a high-ranking military 
commander.</P> 
 
<P>In conjunction with his employment, he completed a security-clearance application in June 2001 (Item 3). As part of the required background investigation, the 
government obtained a credit report (Item 6) concerning Applicant in July 2001. In summary, the credit report revealed 15 accounts in a collection/charge off 
status and a bankruptcy case; it also revealed a reported balance owed (excluding any mortgage) of $15,414 and a reported balance past due of $7,839. </P> 
 
<P>With his current employment overseas, he earned $26,415.10 in 2001 and $50,827.20 in 2002, which was 100% tax free. As of May 30, 2003, Applicant was 
earning $4,235.60 per month, which was 100% tax free, for an annual rate of $50,827.20 (Items 2.B &amp; 2.C). His savings account balance as of May 31, 2003, 
was $5,275.89 (Item 5.G). His checking account balance as of April 26, 2004, was $123.36 (Response to FORM). </P> 
 
<P>Concerning the bankruptcy case (SOR &para; 1.n &amp; &para; 1.o), Applicant filed a Chapter 7 petition in May 2001, shortly before he accepted his current employment. 
Based upon a review of the petition (Item 8), it appears Applicant filed the petition <EM>pro se</EM>, without the assistance of counsel. Likewise, the summary of 
schedules was left blank, and it appears that Schedules D and E were mixed together. The bankruptcy court dismissed the petition in June 2001, apparently 
because Applicant did not make his initial appearance due to the start of his overseas employment the same month.</P> 
 
<P>In his response to the FORM, Applicant asserts the total balance remaining on his bills is less than $4,500, and that the total left on the federal student loans is 
$1,700, which he is paying $450 monthly. He says the student loans will be paid off by the end of July 2004. He also asserts three accounts (&para; 1.b, &para; 1.c and &para; 
1.j), listed as unresolved in the table, will be written off due to age, and so, he does not plan to pay or resolve them. Applicant asserts he has trimmed his living 
expenses by no longer renting a car at his overseas location, and that he is no longer sending money to his wife's family. Finally, he asserts he has paid off 
$30,000 in debt in less than three years. </P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges Applicant has 13 delinquent accounts with a total indebtedness of approximately $18,000. The following table summarizes the relevant details 
about the 13 delinquent accounts.</P>

<P>To sum up, it appears he has paid 3 of the 13 delinquent accounts, he is paying on 4 accounts, and 6 accounts are unresolved. Based on the unresolved accounts 
alone, he may owe as much as $7,726 in delinquent debt.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted

Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against them.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline F. The 13 delinquent accounts and the dismissed 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy case demonstrate a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Also, the 
same facts and circumstances demonstrate financial irresponsibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. In particular, his financial problems cannot be viewed as not recent<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
because his delinquencies are ongoing. His situation is not an isolated incident<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> because it involved multiple accounts over a period of years. Applicant has 
paid 3 of the 13 delinquent accounts in the SOR, it appears he has resolved debts not addressed in the SOR, and he is making good progress on the student 
loans. Nevertheless,  based on the quality of the record evidence, I am unable to conclude Applicant has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his 
indebtedness.<A HREF="02-14964.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> His financial problems are long standing and it is simply too soon to tell if he has truly reformed his ways. Until he establishes a long-term track 
record of good debt management and a financially responsible lifestyle, it is likely he will return to not meeting his financial obligations. Accordingly, 
Guideline F is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and other appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
