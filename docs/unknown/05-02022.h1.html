<P>Applicant has numerous relatives who are citizens and residents of Iraq. In December 2004, while serving as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq, Applicant 
disobeyed a directive from his employer that prohibited him from leaving a secure military facility. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 29, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence), and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was 
received by DOHA on September 30, 2005, requested a hearing, and admitted all allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on January 4, 2006, scheduling the hearing for January 19, 2006.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and 
admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on January 27, 2006.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and 
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 49-year-old man who was employed by a defense contractor as a linguist from January 2003 until he was terminated in December 2004. He has 
since obtained employment with another defense contractor as a linguist for which he requires a security clearance. Applicant was previously employed as a cab 
driver from February 1997 until January 2003, and as a retail store manager from January 1993 until February 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is of Kurdish descent, and was born and raised in Iraq. He went as a refugee to Iran in 1975 to escape the violence that was directed against the Kurds 
in Iraq. He resided in refugee camps within Iran until he was permitted to immigrate to the United States in 1977. He obtained a general educational 
development (GED) certificate in the U.S., subsequently attended about two years of college, and has resided continuously in the U.S. since immigrating here in 
1977. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on March 8, 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's parents, four sisters, one brother and many extended family members are citizens and residents of Iraq. He has one additional sister who is a citizen 
and resident of the U.S.  After becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant returned to Iraq in 1991 for a visit of several months duration. While in Iraq, he met and 
married an Iraqi citizen, who returned with him to the U.S. by way of Turkey. Applicant's wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2000. Applicant 
has three sons with his wife, ages 12, 10, and 9. Applicant's parents-in-law are also Kurdish citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant converses with his Iraqi 
relatives every few months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was employed by a civilian government contractor and served as a translator in Iraq for several U.S. Army units from January 2003 until he was 
terminated in December 2004. Applicant's termination occurred because he disobeyed a company directive that required all civilian employees to remain on a 
secure military facility during Ramadan. Applicant disobeyed the directive in order to visit with his elderly parents during Ramadan. Although he indicated in 
his answer to the SOR that he believed the prohibition on leaving the base was only an advisement and not mandatory, he admitted during his testimony that he 
was instructed by his Army supervisor that if he intended to leave he would have to obtain permission from the civilian manager which he did not do because he 
didn't want to talk to him. (Tr. p. 44)   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial 
commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 
of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B, pertaining to 
foreign influence, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="05-02022.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's parents, five siblings, parents-in-law, and many extended family members are citizens and residents of Iraq. He maintains contact with these 
relatives by either them calling him or him calling them every few months. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to 
whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sharing living quarters with 
a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists</EM> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iraq is a country in turmoil with hostage taking and terrorist activity directed against Iraqi civilians, U.S. military forces, and foreign visitors. In that 
environment, Applicant's relatives, through no fault of Applicant or his relatives, are clearly in a position where they could be exploited in a way that could 
force him to choose between his loyalty to them and the United States. Applicant's decision to disobey a company directive to remain within a secure 
environment so that he could visit his parents in Iraq during Ramadan itself creates questions about his judgment, and uncertainty about what could be expected 
of him if he were forced to choose between his loyalty to his parents and the United States. I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and 
none apply. Guideline B is decided against Applicant.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN>. Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies 
confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant deliberately violated a company directive that required him to remain within the secure environment of a military installation in Iraq during the 
Ramadan religious holiday. The directive was obviously issued for security reasons and to protect the persons covered by the directive, including Applicant, 
from the perceived increased threat that could be anticipated during the holiday. In choosing to violate the directive to satisfy his personal desires, Applicant 
placed himself, the classified information he had knowledge of, and possibly U.S. forces who might have to be dispatched in an attempted rescue effort at risk. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or 
concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress  . . . . </EM>apply. I have considered all mitigating 
conditions under Guideline E, and none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified 
information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on 
its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done so, I 
conclude that Applicant has failed to present sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against him.  </SPAN></P>
