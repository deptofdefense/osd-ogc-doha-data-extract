</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 4, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In her response dated August 23, 2004, later amended on September 21, 2004, Applicant admitted to the 
two allegations contained in the SOR and requested an administrative determination based on the submissions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on November 10, 2004, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to her.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted to the two allegations set forth in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 61-year-old female who has been employed as a general office clerk by a defense contractor in South Korea since March 2002.  Born there in 
1943, when that region of Korea was still under Japanese colonial control, she eventually married a U.S. citizen in 1966.  She became a naturalized United 
States citizen in 1971.  Although that marriage ended in divorce in 1975, she married another U.S. citizen in 1977.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2001, Applicant's second husband accepted employment in South Korea with a U.S. firm conducting defense related work for the United States 
government.  In March 2002, with her marriage facing difficulties, Applicant accepted a job with her husband's employer.  This job requires fluency in Korean 
and her daily contacts are with U.S. military personnel and other contractors.  Awarded an interim security clearance in April 2002, Applicant has been trained 
with regard to security issues and reporting requirements.  Shortly after assuming her current position, Applicant became a divorc&eacute;e. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has four children.  Each is a native born citizen of the United States.  Currently, they range in age from 38 to 23.  Her eldest son either serves in, or is 
associated with, the U.S. military.  Although there is no information as to her younger son, her middle daughter is married and her youngest is attending college 
in the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although she was raised in South Korea, Applicant voluntarily relinquished her rights and obligations to that country 34 years ago when she became a citizen of 
the United States and started her family.  She has held a U.S. passport since 1996.  Although her parents are deceased, she has two older sisters who are citizens 
and residents of South Korea.  She notes that her relationship with these sisters could not be used to coerce, exploit, or pressure her because her "decision to 
become a U.S. citizen required [her] to take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and renounce all others,"<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and that they are not agents or representatives of a 
foreign power.  Since leaving South Korea over three decades ago, her contact with her sisters has been "limited."<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant ranks her concern for her sisters 
to be inferior to her concern for her American children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received her GED in 1995.  Since 2001, she has been taking university level classes through a major United States university via extension course-work.  Judging by her prior addresses and occasional periods of varied employment, she often accompanied her second husband on his assignments outside of 
the 48 contiguous states, including previous stints in South Korea.  She has had experience living and working among U.S. defense contractors abroad, and is  
accustomed to life adjacent to, and on, U.S. military bases.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance,<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, it must be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based it, in whole or in part, on any express or 
implied determination as to this Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits that owing to her employ with a defense contractor, 
she is currently residing in  South Korea, the foreign country in which her two sisters remain citizens and residents.  The citizenship and current residence of 
these two family members raises a security concern with regard to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>n immediate family 
member, or a person to whom the individual has close tiers of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When, as here, the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  Hence, it becomes Applicant's opportunity 
to thus demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Here, however, she chose to selectively limit her 
evidence in response to the Government's case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant limited her evidence for mitigation regarding her sisters to only three statements:  First, she states that their relationship to her could not be used to 
coerce, exploit, or pressure her because she has taken her oath to the United States, an oath she took freely and holds as sacred.  Second, she urges that neither 
sister is an agent or representative of the Republic of Korea Government.  Third, she concludes that their contact has been "limited" since she emigrated from 
South Korea.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While these statements effectively parrot a pertinent portion of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>determination 
that the family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sons), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or 
in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied 
States</EM>) and demonstrate familiarity with FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 ([<EM>c</EM>]<EM>ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>), they are 
conclusory; they are not the foundational or substantiated facts an applicant needs to provide the tribunal so that it can make its own supportable conclusions 
and  reasoned judgments.  By merely offering summary conclusions, not facts, Applicant failed to carry her burden and fortify her position with regard to the 
security concern her sisters raise.  Therefore, I find that FI MC E2.A2.1.2.1 and FI MC E2.A2.1.2.3 do not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Living in South Korea is a justifiable condition of employment.  Given these particular circumstances, Applicant's current residency abroad does not, standing 
alone and by itself, pose a disqualifying condition.  Therefore, I find for Applicant with regard to subparagraph 1.b of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered both the record evidence and the Applicant in light of the "whole person" concept.  A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">pplicant is a woman of maturity and experience whose 
narrative statement reflects good character and integrity.  That does not preclude the Government from considering whether her facts and circumstances still 
pose a security risk"<A HREF="03-02877.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant failed to fully explain the circumstances of her sisters and, therefore, has failed to carry her burden and assuage the doubts and 
concerns that they raise.  Inasmuch as any doubts must be resolved in favor of the national security, I find against Applicant with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regard to the pivotal allegation 
set forth at subparagraph 1.a of the SOR.</SPAN></P>
