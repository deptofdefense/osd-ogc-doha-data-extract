<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On September 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR informed 
Applicant that DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR alleged facts which raise security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>On November 15, 2003, Applicant  answered the SOR (Answer) and admitted the single allegation therein. He also requested a hearing. The case was assigned 
to me on March 22, 2004. On April 2, 2004, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on April 22, 2004. At hearing, Department Counsel 
submitted eight exhibits, Applicant submitted three exhibits and his own testimony. All parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received the transcript (Tr) 
on May 4, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On March 30, 2004, Department Counsel submitted a pre-hearing motion to amend the SOR by adding the following as paragraph 2:</P> 
 
<P>"2. Guideline D: <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual 
to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.1 Sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for or a disqualifying 
factor in determining a person's eligibility for a security clearance. Available information raising this concern shows that:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The allegation as set forth in subparagraph 1.a, above."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, Applicant voiced no objection to the motion and admitted the allegation. I granted Department Counsel's motion and will consider Guideline D in 
reaching my decision.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He seeks a clearance in connection with his duties as an inventory control administrator. He has 
held that position since July 2003, but has worked at his current employer since October 2000, when he was hired as a mailroom clerk. Applicant's father was 
in the military and moved his family several times as Applicant grew up. After graduating high school in 1993, Applicant joined the Air Force where he rose to 
the rank of senior airman (E-4). While in the Air Force, he was enrolled in various college courses. He is currently working on his associate's degree at a local 
community college and hopes to transfer to a four-year college in 2005 to finish his bachelor's degree. Applicant performed his Air Force duties well. His 
evaluations reflect generally superior marks and consistent recommendations for immediate promotion. Likewise, his performance evaluations from his current 
job show he is an excellent worker. Applicant also works a second job while attending school in the evenings.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>While in the Air Force, Applicant married another service member; however, the couple separated in June 1998 and their divorce became final in the fall of 
2000. In December 1998, Applicant moved into an apartment complex near his duty station. Sometime in January 1999, a female neighbor came by his 
apartment and introduced her younger sister to Applicant in the hopes he would want to have sex with the younger sister. The girl was 13 years old at the time, 
but told Applicant she was 15 years old. Later that month, the girl came to Applicant's apartment for the first of what would be seven acts of sexual intercourse 
and one act of cunnilingus. These activities ended in March 1999; however, in May 1999, the girl's aunt discovered what had  happened and called the county 
police. At some point during their relationship, Applicant became aware the girl had just turned 14 years old and bought her a cell phone as birthday present.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant confessed to police that these acts had occurred. He was arrested and charged with five counts of second degree rape (a felony) and three counts of 
fourth degree sexual offense (a misdemeanor).<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The county prosecutor eventually <EM>nolle prosequi'd </EM>and Applicant was turned over to the Air Force for 
prosecution. In October 1999, Applicant was convicted at a special court martial of Indecent Acts and Liberties with a Minor, a violation of Article 120 of the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He was sentenced to five months confinement (but served only three due to time already served). He was also 
reduced in grade from E-4 to E-1, required to forfeit all pay and allowances, and issued a bad conduct discharge.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In May 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service agent in connection with the current background investigation. He lied to the agent 
when he said the girl he had sex with told him she was 17 years old when they met.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He made that statement because he was embarrassed by what he had done. 
He is still embarrassed by it. At his current job, only one other person knows about what he did; however, several friends away from the work place know about 
it and have submitted statements of support and recommendation.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </STRONG>Under this<STRONG> </STRONG>guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> The government has 
established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline by showing Applicant deliberately engaged in compromising sexual misconduct he knew 
to be against the law. As a result, he is still embarrassed by what he regards as an error in judgment. This embarrassment has precluded him from disclosing this 
adverse information to his current employer. Guideline E DC 4<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies with full effect to undermine this Applicant's suitability for continued access.</P> 
 
<P>There is no basis in this record for application of any Guideline E mitigating condition. Indeed, Applicant's continued embarrassment caused him to falsify his 
statement to DSS in May 2000, which, as noted below under Guideline D, only serves to exacerbate the government's concerns about Applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information. I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline D (Sexual Behavior). </STRONG>Under this guideline, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sexual behavior becomes a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or 
emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> The government has established 
a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. Applicant engaged in sexual conduct he knew to be illegal and he is still embarrassed by his 
conduct, which he further acknowledges was a mistake in judgment. Guideline D disqualifying condition (DC) 1,<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN> DC 3<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 4<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply. By contrast, 
because it has been more than five years since these events took place and there is no indication of other similar conduct. Mitigating condition (MC) 2<A HREF="02-21957.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
applies. However, his continued embarrassment over this event and his willingness to falsify his statement to DSS about this event lead me to conclude he has 
failed to mitigate the security concerns engendered by his conduct. I conclude Guideline D against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. The Applicant is a bright, hard-working person who appears to 
have matured in many facets of his life since he left jail in 2000. Nonetheless, the record evidence as a whole in this case presents an unacceptable risk to the 
government's compelling interest in ensuring its classified information is properly safeguarded. I conclude Applicant should not be granted access to classified 
information. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P>
