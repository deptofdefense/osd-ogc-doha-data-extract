<P>Applicant was terminated in 1997 from employment as a corrections officer with a sheriff's department  for violating numerous department regulations, 
including compromising a criminal case and associating with criminals and unsavory characters.  He is unable to mitigate the security concern caused by his 
personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline E (personal conduct) based upon Applicant's conduct while employed as a corrections officer with a 
sheriff's department that resulted in him being fired.  Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR on May 20, 2003, partially admitted the allegations contained 
in the SOR, and requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on August 14, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 19, 2003, scheduling the hearing for September 5, 2003.  The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted three documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3 
and admitted into the record without an objection.  The Applicant testified at the hearing, called two witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted fourteen 
documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-N and admitted into the record without an objection.  Department Counsel initially 
objected to AE N on the basis of relevancy and completeness, but withdrew the objection after Applicant submitted the entire document.  The transcript was 
received on September 17, 2003.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 34 years old and has never been married.  He has two children, ages thirteen and ten, who live near him in the custody of their mother, and for 
whom he provides support and sees on a frequent basis.  He graduated high school in 1988, enlisted in the U.S. Army on July 14, 1988, and served on active 
duty until March 5, 1992 when he was honorably discharged, having attained the rank of Specialist 4.   He resides with his father in the same house that he has 
lived in his entire life, with the exception of the time he served in the Army.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was hired by a sheriff's department as a corrections auxiliary officer on May 25, 1992, graduated from the basic corrections academy on June 17, 
1994, and was certified as a corrections officer on August 3, 1994.  In addition to his duties as a corrections officer, Applicant was assigned as a member of the 
Corrections Response Team.  He was promoted to the rank of corporal on June 13, 1997.  Applicant received a number of awards and commendations for his 
service to the department, and was rated as a competent and effective corrections officer.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An internal investigation was conducted in 1997 by the sheriff's department that employed Applicant based upon allegations that he was associating with 
criminals and unsavory characters.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The allegations arose from reports made by a number of police officers that they had observed Applicant in the company 
of known criminals.  The investigation documented eleven occasions in March 1997 when Applicant was seen at various locations, including a tavern, in the 
company of one of three different known criminals.  The investigative report, dated June 10, 1997,<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> concluded that the individuals were a cousin and two 
childhood friends of Applicant, that his association with those persons had not affected his job performance or the interests of the department, and that each of 
the charges was "Not Sustained."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A second internal investigation concerning Applicant's conduct as a corrections officer was initiated on or about June 19, 1997.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The allegations that caused 
this investigation originated from law enforcement officers who had been engaged in a large scale narcotics investigation involving local, state, and federal 
police agencies.  During the course of that investigation two men were arrested and housed in the jail where Applicant was employed as a corrections officer.  
One of those  arrested was cooperating with law enforcement officers, and had agreed to testify against the second arrestee.  These two prisoners were ordered 
to be held separate within the jail.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Applicant escorted the cooperating prisoner from his cell to an interview room where he  met with a law enforcement officer.  Following this assignment, 
Applicant on at least two occasions passed notes from the non-cooperating prisoner to the one who had been interviewed by police and was cooperating with 
them.  The tenor of both notes was to strongly discourage further cooperation.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted passing the notes, but denied knowing there was a "keep 
separate" order in effect or the contents of the notes.  His testimony on both these issues is not credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The internal investigation also partially revisited the issues that had been considered in the June 10, 1997 report of investigation.  Specifically, the second 
investigation again focused on Applicant frequenting the same tavern that was mentioned in the first investigation, with the additional allegation that he was 
aware marijuana was being openly used in the establishment.  Applicant admitted frequenting the tavern and smelling marijuana being smoked while he was 
present therein. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The investigation concluded that in passing the notes between the two inmates Applicant  had violated various department regulations, namely: engaging in 
prohibited conduct, failing to comply with laws and regulations, compromising criminal cases, and assisting criminals.  It also concluded he had violated 
additional regulations by frequenting the tavern in question, namely: associating with criminals and unsavory characters and failure to report criminal 
information.  The sheriff's office conducted a pre-deprivation hearing based upon the findings contained in the investigation and terminated Applicant's 
employment with the department.  Applicant's petition to the civil service board seeking to have his termination reversed was filed out of time and was 
therefore not considered.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was unemployed for approximately one year following the termination of his employment with the sheriff's office.  He thereafter held two jobs as a 
driver until he began his current employment as a security police officer on October 22, 2001.  Applicant has not associated with persons engaged in criminal 
activity since at least 1999.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chiefs among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The severity of the misconduct that resulted in the termination of applicant's employment as a corrections officer cannot be overstated.  A high degree of trust 
was placed in him, not only to secure jail inmates, but to also assure that the law enforcement and prosecutorial functions of the criminal justice system were 
not compromised by the actions of those inmates.  In passing notes to an inmate that were clearly drafted in an effort to dissuade that inmate from cooperating 
with police and prosecutors he emphatically demonstrated he is not a person who can be trusted.  By associating with known criminals while he was employed 
as a corrections officer, even if those criminals were boyhood friends and a cousin, and frequenting a tavern where criminal laws were being violated by the 
open use of a controlled substance he at a minimum exhibited extremely poor judgment.       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; DC 4: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>; and DC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Association 
with persons involved in criminal activity </EM>apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attempts to minimize his conduct through his testimony, and the testimony of the witnesses he called on his behalf, to the effect that passing notes, 
magazines, commissary, etc. between inmates by corrections officers was common practice.  However, evidence that others were violating the rules, 
regulations, and laws that are intended to safeguard the functioning of the criminal justice system and jail-inmates hardly can be considered mitigation.  If 
anything, the actions of those other individuals imposed upon Applicant a duty to report their misconduct, which he failed to perform.  Further, Applicant's 
actions in passing notes between inmates who were segregated because one had agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of the other is enormously more 
egregious than the act of passing magazines, commissary, or innocuous notes.  I reiterate, I do not find Applicant's testimony that he was not aware of the 
contents of the notes or the fact that the inmates were ordered to be kept separate credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also attempts to minimize his conduct by pointing out that another corrections officer who passed a note between the same inmates received only a 
thirty-day suspension.  He further attempts to explain the harsh treatment he received as retaliation for exercising his right to seek legal representation.  GE 3 
explains the fully-justified reasons for the disparate treatment, not the least of which is the totally innocuous content of the note passed by the other office.  GE 
3 also establishes that Applicant's termination was based solely upon his conduct and not an attempt at retaliation for the exercise of a legal right.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also places much reliance on the fact that shortly before he was terminated similar, if not identical, charges to some that formed the basis for his 
termination had been found to be "Not Sustained."  Suffice it to say that when the misconduct of Applicant passing notes between inmates was discovered it 
was totally reasonable for the sheriff's department to revisit the earlier investigation and view the charges therein in the light of the additional information that 
was then available to them concerning Applicant's activities. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and find that MC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>; and MC 7: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased</EM> apply in this case.  
Additionally, Applicant receives credit under the "whole person" concept for his four years of honorable military service, reflected not only by his receipt of an 
honorable discharge, but also award of the Army Achievement Medal and Army Commendation Medal.  He receives further credit for the five years of faithful 
service he gave to the sheriff's department, evidenced by the awards, commendations, and evaluations that have been admitted into the record, as well as his 
steady home and family life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions.  Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  Once again, it must be noted that no one has a right to a security 
clearance<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-30941.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence of record in this case, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating condition, I find that Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concern caused by his personal conduct.  The gravity of the misconduct that resulted in his termination from employment as a 
corrections officer, a position of trust, prevents a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion.  Guideline E is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
