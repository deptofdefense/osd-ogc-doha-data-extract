<P>Applicant incurred 20 delinquent debts over several years.  He did not repay or otherwise resolve these debts.  He failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his 
security clearance application, and told the government investigator he allowed his debts to become delinquent and did not tell his creditors of his new address 
each time he moved.  He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on the hearing day.  Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concern 
or the personal conduct security concern.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On October 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated November 12, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested a hearing.  This case was assigned to 
me January 27, 2004.  A Notice of Hearing was issued February 3, 2004, setting the hearing for February 19, 2004.  Applicant requested a continuance because 
he had just hired an attorney who needed to prepare for the hearing.  I granted the continuance, and the second notice of hearing issued on March 12, 2004, 
setting the hearing date for April 6, 2004.  On that date, I convened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented five exhibits which were admitted into evidence. Applicant submitted four exhibits at the hearing, 
and submitted another four exhibits after the hearing.  I received the transcript on April 14, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old military retiree.  He works as a computer technician for a defense contractor.  He is married to his second wife, by whom he has two 
children.  Applicant also has a child by his first wife, and supports his second wife's two children from her first marriage.  His first marriage started in 1981 and 
ended in divorce in 2000. (Tr. 15, 16, 41: Exhibits 1 at 1 and 3, 2 at 2, and E)</P> 
<P>Applicant incurred a number of debts during the course of his first marriage, and particularly since 1995.  He allowed some of those debts to become 
delinquent, while paying other debts.  In his sworn statement to an investigator in December 2001, he admitted allowing debts to become delinquent, and  not 
notifying his creditors when he moved.  Applicant also stated that he was going to contact his creditors and resolve these debts.  His testimony at the hearing 
revealed he did not make those contacts, but waited for bills to be sent to him.  His personal financial statement submitted in 2001 showed a net remainder 
monthly of $1869 because he was not paying his debts.  Instead, Applicant spent his income on purchases for himself and his family. (Exhibit 2 at 5 to 8; Tr. 
47, 52 to 54, 62 to 68)</P> 
<P>Applicant's debts and their disposition as shown by Exhibit C, the record,  and her Answer, are as follows:</P>

<P>Applicant filed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy at 11:19 a.m. on the morning of the hearing.  Applicant had his investigative interview in December 2001, stated he 
would pay his debts, but took no action to do so.  Applicant's bankruptcy includes other debts than those listed on the SOR, but only nine SOR debts are listed 
on the bankruptcy Schedule F.  When he received the notice of hearing, he requested a continuance, received it, but did nothing to repay his debts until the 
morning of the hearing.  Applicant has a 48 month Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to pay 50% of his debts and makes monthly payments of $544 to the trustee.  
Applicant asked at the hearing for a chance to pay his debts that total nearly $100,000 in the SOR, but only $49,956 in the bankruptcy.  Applicant takes the 
position he was not aware of many of his debts until December 2001 when he read the credit report shown him by the investigator.  By November 2002, 
Applicant had four judgments against him. (Tr. 18, 37 to 40, 47, 82; Exhibits 2 at 5 to 9, D, F)</P> 
<P>Applicant answered with denials security clearance application (SCA) Questions 38 (delinquent debts over 180 days in the past seven years) and 39 (delinquent 
debts over 90 days), while actually having several debts exceeding those time standards, including subparagraphs 1.a. 1.j. to 1.q. and 1.s. and 1.t. (Exhibit 1 at 7 
to 8; Exhibit 2 at 5 and 6; Tr. 18, 36, 56, 64 to 68)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by 
substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national 
security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 
12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.2.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a 
personal security or trustworthiness determination.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; E2.A5.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) A pattern of dishonesty. E2.A5.1.2.5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative 
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering Guideline F (Financial Considerations), I conclude Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (an 
inability to satisfy debts) apply here.  Applicant has not paid his debts for several years, at least the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  The bankruptcy filing 
shows other debts Applicant seeks to pay under the Chapter 13 plan.  Applicant also professes ignorance of many debts, and provided varying testimony about 
his repayment efforts on the credit union, jewelry store, and mortgage debt, to list but three such debts.  Applicant moved twice and never contacted his 
creditors, testifies he never got bills that he could pay or use to contact these creditors after the December 2001 investigative interview, provided no 
documentation concerning debts he asserts were paid, and did nothing about satisfying these debts even after the SOR was sent to him in October 2003.  
Applicant incurred large debts, kept buying "nice stuff to have and stuff for the family" (as he admits), and rarely paid off any debt. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable here.  Applicant never made a good-faith effort to repay these debts.  Garnishment and judgments were 
used by some of his creditors to obtain payment.  Applicant at the last hour before the hearing filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy on only part of the debts listed in the 
SOR.  I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns, and hold against Applicant under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, I conclude the Government proved its case.  Applicant did not reveal all of his outstanding debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew these debts 
were delinquent, he should have disclosed them </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on the security clearance application</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, but failed to do so. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 2 (the deliberate omission or concealment of 
relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire) applies.  Also, DC 5 (a pattern of dishonesty) applies because Applicant established such a 
pattern because he has not repaid his debts as he said he would do, and by falsifying his SCA. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no MC to apply here under these facts.  I find Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the totality of his debts, or even that he had any that were 
delinquent.  Applicant may not have known about the judgments by February 22, 2001, when he completed his SCA, but he knew about the garnishments for 
the credit union that were made because he was so late on paying bills.  He also knew he had not paid his mortgage regularly for whatever reason.  He knew he 
borrowed money or used credit cards, and owed that money even if the creditors could not find him because he moved and did not notify them of his new 
address.  Furthermore, Applicant admitted he allowed his debts to become delinquent and that is why his personal financial statement in 2001 showed a net 
remainder of $1869 monthly.  Therefore, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
