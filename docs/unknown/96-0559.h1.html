<P>On September 19, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to                     (Applicant), which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 22, 1996. The case was received by the undersigned on November 26, 1996, and a Notice of Hearing
was issued on December 12, 1996. A hearing was held on January 7, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</STRONG></U></P>

<P>At the hearing, Paragraph 1.c. of the SOR was amended to delete any reference to Executive Order 12564. As amended, Paragraph 1.c. is as follows:</P>

<P>You used and purchased marijuana, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b., above, after having been granted a Department of Defense Top Secret Clearance
on December 18, 1990.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Applicant is a thirty-four year old married man. He has been employed by the same defense contractor since 1986. He has held a DoD Top Secret security
clearance since 1990.</P>

<P>Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times "on a nearly daily basis," from 1975 to June 1981. From the time he graduated from high school in
June 1981 to sometime in late 1992 or early 1993, he used marijuana very infrequently, at most "several times." However, in late 1992 or early 1993, he
resumed his regular use of it, and eventually his use "snowballed" to the point that he was again using it "on a nearly daily basis." This regular use of marijuana
continued until July 1995 when applicant "simply decided to quit."Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since July 1995, and does not intend to use
it in the future.</P>

<P>During the time applicant was using marijuana he was also purchasing it. He usually purchased small bags of it; however, on one occasion in the 1990s, he
purchased an ounce of it for "about $300-350."</P>

<P>From the time he was hired by his current employer in 1986 until approximately November 1994, applicant completed and executed approximately six PSQs.
Applicant intentionally provided false, material information about his involvement with illegal drugs on all of the PSQs when, in response to questions
concerning his past involvement with illegal drugs, he stated that he had used marijuana only twenty-four times, and/or stated that he had not used marijuana
since 1981. Although applicant admits that he had lied about the recency and frequency of his marijuana use, he testified, credibly, that when he stated on the
1990 and 1991 PSQs (G-2 and G-3) that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, he meant it (TR at 41-43).</P>

<P>In September 1995, applicant got tired of lying about his drug use. In his words, "it bothered (his) conscience." After he told his wife and family members about
his drug use, he voluntarily informed his employer's security department that he had lied on his PSQs. At the same time, he provided the security department
with the true facts about his drug use; namely, that his use of marijuana prior to 1982 was much more extensive than the twenty-four times he had admitted to,
and that he had used marijuana through July 1995. In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) in February 1996 (G-8),
applicant stated that he "purposely falsified" his PSQs to ensure that he got his clearance.</P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">POLICIES</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth the Adjudication Policy (divided into Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors) which must be followed by the
Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are applicable:</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">DRUG INVOLVEMENT</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Disqualifying Factors:</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">1. Any drug abuse</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">2. Illegal drug possession</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that reasonably suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard
classified information. If the Government meets its burden, it has established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. Once the Government establishes a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, the
burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation, extenuation, mitigation or reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the Government's
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, he or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the Directive's requirement that a security clearance be granted
only upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In this case, the Government established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT>case under Criterion H. The evidence establishes that applicant used marijuana (1) with varying
frequency, at times "on a nearly daily basis," from 1975 to June 1981, (2) on an infrequent basis from June 1981 to late 1992 or early 1993, and (3) with varying
frequency, at times "on a nearly daily basis," from late 1992 or early 1993 to July 1995. Applicant's abuse of marijuana reflects adversely on his judgment,
reliability and trustworthiness, and reasonably suggests that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information for at least two reasons:</P>

<P>First, individuals granted access to classified information are responsible for safeguarding it twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, on and off the job.
An applicant who abuses marijuana cannot be relied upon to meet his or her security responsibilities because the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information through neglect or inattention while "high" on it is too great.</P>

<P>Second, applicant used marijuana for many years with full knowledge that each time he used it he was breaking the law. This suggests that applicant may be
unwilling to abide by security regulations if he finds them in conflict with his personal wishes or desires.</P>

<P>Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since July 1995, and does not intend to use it, or any other illegal drug, in the future. In most cases, when an
applicant has a history of lying about his drug use, his uncorroborated testimony that he has reformed is not considered credible. However, in this case, I
conclude that applicant's testimony is credible and worthy of belief. Although this conclusion is based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole,
including applicant's demeanor and conduct while testifying, the fact that he voluntarily reported his dishonest conduct and the true extent of his drug use to his
security department, knowing full well that these disclosures could cost him his security clearance and employment, is the most persuasive evidence that
applicant is now telling the truth about his drug use.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, applicant's credible testimony is insufficient to overcome the Government's prima facie under Criterion H.  In view of (1) applicant's long
history of marijuana abuse (over twenty years), (2) the recency of  this abuse (less than two years ago), (3) applicant's previous inability to follow through with
his stated intention not to use marijuana in the future (notwithstanding the fact that when he stated this intention on his 1990 and 1991 PSQs, almost ten years
had passed since he had last used marijuana on a regular basis), and (4) the fact that he has not received any type of drug counseling (even though he has stated
that he believes he was psychologically addicted to marijuana),<A HREF="96-0559.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> I cannot conclude, at the present time, that applicant will be able to follow through with his
stated intention and not use marijuana again. For this reason, Criterion H is found against applicant.</P>

<P>With respect to Criterion E, the factual allegations incorporated by reference  (i.e., applicant's use and purchase of marijuana after he received a security
clearance), do not support an adverse finding.<FONT FACE="Times"><A HREF="96-0559.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> Therefore, Criterion E is found for applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">DECISION</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for applicant.</FONT></P>
