<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></P>

<P>	On August 16, 1996, the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals
(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine
whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer
to the SOR on September 27, 1996.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on  November 18, 1996. A notice of hearing
was issued on December 16, 1996, and the case was heard on January 7, 1997. The Government
submitted documentary evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript was
received on January 21, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the
documents and the live testimony. The SOR alleges excessive consumption of alcohol (Criterion
G). Applicant admitted all allegations, and his admissions shall become Findings of Fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant is 53 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He seeks a secret level
clearance. Applicant engaged in excessive consumption of alcohol from 1982 to August 1995 but
there were periods of abstinence. In 1982, Applicant stopped for about 6 months after he was
arrested in October 1982 for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI). (GE #2).
Applicant's treating doctor recalled that over the last 10 years, intermittently, Applicant refrained
from alcohol use for a few months. (Tr. 19; 37). Recently, Applicant has been abstinent since
August 31, 1995. (GE #2). </P>

<P>      	In 1979, Applicant believed he might have a drinking problem and attended an alcohol
awareness program.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> He completed the program and thought he could maintain control over his
drinking. In 1982, his drinking increased. On October 18, 1982, Applicant consumed about eight
beers in the afternoon and was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI).
He was found guilty of DWI and his license was suspended for 18 months. As a result of the
alcohol-related offense, Applicant stopped drinking for about seven or eight months and attended
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for approximately six months. (Tr. 104). He resumed drinking
because he thought he could keep his consumption under control.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	From August 18 to September 7, 1987, Applicant received inpatient treatment for alcohol
dependence, continuous.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Dr. A also diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 30). During
the course of treatment, Applicant still exhibited denial because he did not embrace concept of
powerlessness over alcohol, and blamed his drinking on other problems. (GE #4). His wife was
very active in his treatment. At discharge, Applicant's fair prognosis was based on his level of
awareness of what he necessary to maintain continued sobriety. The discharge recommendations
were to attend as many Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as possible, and pursue aftercare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	During his employment between 1988 and 1993, he was unable to report to work because
of alcoholic binges, and was required to attend alcohol counseling. Applicant was terminated by
his previous employer on August 31, 1995 because of an alcoholic binge which rendered him
unable to conduct business. (GE #6). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant received counseling from Dr. A from 1992 to January 1996.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant also received treatment from another doctor from August 5, 1995 to January
1996 for chronic alcoholism.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Dr. A has consulted with Applicant once a week almost every week for the past 17
months. (Tr. 19). Dr. A provided a good prognosis based on Applicant's 17 month participation
in group therapy once a week. (Tr. 27). Although Applicant manifested the same symptoms of
alcohol dependence just before treatment in 1987 as he did when he began group therapy at the
end of August 1995, his aftercare then was not as comprehensive then as it has been since August
31, 1995. (Tr. 30; 49). The primary difference is the presence of Applicant's sponsor, and
Applicant's regular and frequent attendance in AA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Mr. B, Applicant's sponsor for 17 months (Tr. 61), who has been in recovery since 1978,
has known Applicant through AA for the past 3 years. (Tr. 53). Since Applicant began group
therapy treatment in August 1995, Mr. B has observed Applicant more concerned about others
than he had been before group therapy. (Tr. 58).<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> Applicant has reached the maintenance Steps
(Steps 10, 11 and 12, that help a person maintain daily sobriety) of the 12 Step Program. (Tr.
66).<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> Applicant's future, according to Mr. A, is positive because he has complied with the
recovery process outlined in the Book of AA.<A HREF="96-0583.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Mrs. C, Applicant's wife, has been married to him for 28 years and has lived with him the
entire time except for 3 months in 1993 when they unofficially separated because of his drinking.
(Tr.  77). Applicant's first real effort of abstinence was after the treatment in 1987 when he
abstained for a number of months while participating in AA. He was not happy and gradually
reduced his attendance in AA after the first 2 months. (Tr. 70). He began drinking again, less
than a year after the 1987 treatment. (Tr. 71). However, Applicant has consumed no alcohol since
the end of August 1995. Mrs. C would be able to tell because Applicant's demeanor changes after
he has  been drinking. Not only the manner of his speech but also the subject matter of his speech
changes. (Tr. 72). He becomes more relaxed. (Tr. 73). Applicant never had a sponsor before (Tr.
75) and the fact he is helping others means he is really committed to his therapy and AA. (Tr.
76). Mrs. C will not put up with Applicant's drinking anymore. (Tr. 76).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant started attending Dr. A's group therapy twice a day in early September 1995
because of withdrawal and to blunt the urge to drink. (Tr. 94). He started the medication because
Dr. A had observed positive results in the past using the medication. (Tr. 94). After the
medication had been in Applicant's body for a few days, Applicant lost his desire to drink as well
as his thought process about drinking. (Tr. 97). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	When Applicant began AA in September 1995, he was attending AA approximately 6
times a week. In his latest recovery attempt, Step 1 had new meaning and Applicant has recently
made amends under Step 9 by contacting 2 former employers (subparagraphs 1e and 1f of the
SOR) and discussing his alcohol-related activity leading to alcohol counseling and termination.
(Tr. 99-100).  He still attends AA often because the participation helps him with the small
problems of daily living. (Tr. 102).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant reviewed GE #2 and conceded he pronounced many of the same statements
about his feelings and future intentions after his treatment in 1987. However, Applicant found
himself to still be in denial of the depth of his alcohol problem when he was discharged in 1987,
even though his statements provided a different impression. (Tr. 116).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant will keep attending AA and group therapy because life is better for him than it
was 10 years ago, and because he has received a second chance and is securing the right support
to sustain recovery. (Tr. 121-122).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's
reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of
fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to
evaluation of the facts in this case are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Excessive Alcohol Consumption (Criterion G)</CENTER>
</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors Against Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	2. Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated
condition, or drinking on the job.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	3. Diagnosis by a credential medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	4. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	5. Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed
medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors for Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	4. Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has
successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements,
participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or similar organization, abstained
from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a
credentialed medical professional. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the
Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and,
(8) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an
applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative
Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in
the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion G (excessive
alcohol consumption) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and
trustworthiness. While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the
sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is
unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The Government has clearly established a case of excessive alcohol consumption going
back to at least 1982.  Applicant committed an alcohol-related offense away from work in
October 1982 when he  was found guilty of DWI. While the record shows no alcohol-related
incidents of actual abuse of any member of his family, alcohol created discord within the family
prior to Applicant's admission to inpatient treatment in 1987, and prompted his wife to order him
out of their house in 1993. On two occasions between 1988 and 1993, Applicant could not report
to work because of his binge drinking and was required to attend counseling to be monitored by
his supervisor. In August 1995, Applicant was terminated from his job because he was unable to
conduct business due to his alcohol binge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	In 1987, Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by the inpatient treating
personnel as well as Dr. A. Applicant has engaged in habitual or episodic alcohol consumption
since at least 1982. After his discharge from inpatient treatment in 1987, with a diagnosis of
alcohol dependence in remission, Applicant started drinking again in less than a year. Applicant's
serious alcohol problem was clearly underscored when he was unable to report for work on two
occasions between 1988 and 1993 while working for one employer, and was terminated from
another job in August 1995 when his binge drinking rendered him unable to conduct business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Obviously, the alcohol-related incidents indicate a pattern of behavior that has occurred
both on and off the job. Furthermore, the three job-related incidents indicate the severity of
Applicant's drinking problem as he was unable to report for work or unable to conduct business.
The alcohol incidents are a part of an alcohol problem Applicant first had difficulty controlling in
1982. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The unsuccessful efforts to stop between 1982 and 1987, the unsuccessful treatment in
1987, the failed efforts to maintain AA, together with continued drinking at excessive levels for
another  eight years until August 1995, definitely establishes concerns about the future chances
Applicant's long range recovery. However, Applicant's present recovery effort has two essential
components working together that were not working together before. Applicant has been in AA
for 17 months and, he has been in group therapy for 17 months. Applicant never had a sponsor
before his present recovery effort. In previous attempts of working the Steps and attending AA,
Applicant stopped his AA attendance altogether because he did not want to devote the necessary
time in taking the moral inventory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Although the record is basically silent on Applicant's past recovery network (except for
his family's support) before August 1995, his present network is as committed to Applicant's
sobriety as Applicant is. First, I am convinced Mrs. C will continue to provide the necessary
support in Applicant's ongoing  recovery. Mr. B has clearly given Applicant reliable and
trustworthy direction in keeping him from any slips in the past 17 months. Dr. A has clearly had
a positive effect because Applicant has become consistent in therapy as demonstrated by the last
17 months. The 12 Steps have had a positive effect because Applicant has worked Step 9 into his
life by making amends with two previous employers for alcohol-related incidents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Considering (1) Applicant's ongoing outpatient treatment once a week for the past 17
months, and his intention to  outpatient therapy in the future, (2) Applicant's frequent attendance
in AA either five or six times a week for the past 17 months, (3) the strong network of Mrs. C,
Dr. A, and Mr. B in support of Applicant's continued recovery, and, (4) Applicant's success in
incorporating the 12 Steps in his everyday life, as well as the lives of others, Applicant has
satisfied his burden of showing he qualifies for a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> Between 1982 and 1987, Applicant stopped and started drinking about three or four times for periods of
two or three months.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> Applicant had been drinking daily for a week before he was admitted for inpatient
treatment, and his drinking was provoking conflict with his wife and kids. (Tr. 109).
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A> Dr. A's treatment actually began in 1986 at a detoxification center when the doctor saw Applicant once
every other week for about three or four months; since then, Dr. A saw Applicant about once every 18 months or
two years. (Tr. 18). Since August 1995, Applicant has attended Dr. A's outpatient group meetings once a week and
two hours per session. When Applicant first resumed therapy with Dr. A, the two talked about what was best for
Applicant and Dr. A concluded outpatient therapy would be most effective because Applicant had been through
inpatient treatment before. (Tr. 21). Dr. A also chose an alternative medication to the usual medication prescribed
for abusers who were having trouble stopping alcohol consumption. (Tr. 21; 24). 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A> According to the doctor's letter dated January 10, 1996 (GE #7), and addressed to an ----------------,
Applicant was already on some kind of medication when he reestablished contact with Dr. A at the end of August
1995. Apparently, the doctor was not aware of Applicant's relapse on August 20, 1995 because there is no reference
to the incident. Applicant discontinued the medication some time in January 1996.

questions, the questions Mr. B used as examples of detecting alcohol use, do not appear to be esoteric or overly

<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A> Applicant testified he has reached Step 12. (Tr. 97). He could never get beyond Step 4 in his efforts

abstinence. (Tr. 67).
