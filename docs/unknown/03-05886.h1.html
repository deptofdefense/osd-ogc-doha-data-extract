<P>Applicant was issued a letter of reprimand and discharged from the Naval Reserve with an other than honorable discharge in 1998 based on his attempted theft 
of a government computer. He was convicted of shoplifting in 2002, and failed to reveal that conviction during the course of a security clearance eligibility 
interview. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his criminal and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 29, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that 
was received by DOHA on May 17, 2004. He admitted the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a., denied the allegation in subparagraph 2.a., and 
admitted all other allegations with explanations. Applicant requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on November 30, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 15, 2004. 
The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and 
admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-7. AE 
1 was admitted into the record without objection. AE 2-7 were admitted into the record over Department Counsel's objection. The transcript was received on 
December 29, 2004.        </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 46-year-old man who has been employed by a government contractor, presently as a senior engineer, since June 1988. He graduated from college 
in December 1982 and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering. Applicant has been married since October 1990, although his wife 
took their three children and moved out of the marital residence in early 2004. He is now seeking to regain custody of the children. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1983 to June 1988. He was a lieutenant at the time of his release from active duty, and, after 
affiliating with the Naval Reserve as a drilling reservist, was eventually promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander. Applicant received a punitive letter of 
reprimand in 1998 for attempting to misappropriate a government computer for his personal use. He was thereafter discharged with an other than honorable 
(OTH) discharge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The circumstances leading to issuance of the reprimand and subsequent discharge began with Applicant's efforts to purchase a used government computer from 
a government resale facility. Frustrated in his efforts because others apparently received advance notice when computers would be available at the resale 
facility, and without adequate funds to buy a new computer, Applicant decided to take a computer that had been designated as scrap from a government 
building. He attempted to conceal the computer after he was observed carrying it from the building to his personal automobile, however, his involvement in the 
attempted theft was discovered as the result of a criminal investigation. Applicant was in a drill status at the time of the incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on June 11, 2002 and charged with shoplifting. His version of the incident leading up to the arrest is that he went to a store to purchase a 
lightbulb, discovered empty bags in a cart he was using, and for unexplainable reasons placed a number of items in the bags and was apprehended after he left 
the store without paying for those items. He was convicted of the offense on July 9, 2002, and sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), placed on three months 
probation, ordered to perform 25 hours community service work, and fined $100.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife, parents, and children are unaware of his criminal actions, and he does not want them to find out about them. He is concerned about the impact 
that learning of these incidents would have on his spouse's mental health and his parent's physical health. He does not think his children need to know of them 
because of their ages.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not disclose the computer theft incident in a security clearance application (SF 86) he submitted on May 6, 2002 in response to a question asking 
about military disciplinary proceedings. He testified he was unsure of how to answer the question because he does not know if he had been subjected to 
proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In response to other questions in the SF 86, Applicant did disclose he had received an OTH 
discharge and that he left the Naval Reserve because of allegations of misconduct and poor judgment. Accordingly, I find his explanation for the apparent 
incorrect answer credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) on September 23, 2002. During the course of that interview he did not 
disclose his 2002 conviction for shoplifting. His justification for not telling the special agent about the conviction is that the agent didn't ask him about it and it 
is his belief that if you're not asked about something you shouldn't volunteer information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant places much of the blame for his two criminal actions on his physical health and his wife's mental health. Specifically, he suffered a stroke in 1996, 
and possibly two earlier undetected strokes, that he attributes, at least in part, to his wife having mental health problems that originated from her being the 
victim of childhood mistreatment. While it is somewhat unclear what exactly he sees as the connection, it appears he believes his physical problems, the 
medication he is taking, and the stress of coping with her mental problems have combined to cause him to have lapses in judgment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is still taking the medications, and, as evidenced by the marital separation and ongoing child custody dispute, is still attempting to cope with the 
stress. A further complication from these issues is that Applicant has difficulty with his short-term memory. Accordingly, he takes and retains copious notes 
about pretty much everything that is occurring in his life because he believes he would otherwise forget the information.       </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-05886.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J based upon the attempted theft of the government computer and the shoplifting 
incident. Although the record does not contain definitive evidence that Applicant was subjected to disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ, he admits 
attempting to misappropriate the computer for his personal use and to being reprimanded for his actions. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all possible mitigating conditions, and none apply. Most notably, Applicant attributes his two criminal misdeeds to a combination of his 
physical health, his spouse's mental health, and short-term memory problems. All of those factors are still present in Applicant's life, and, considering his wife 
took their children and moved out of the marital residence last year bringing about an ongoing child custody dispute, may well be greater now than ever before. 
Accordingly, there is no basis in the record to find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to 
the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM> apply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no 
applicability to the facts of this case. Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, an officer, violated the trust and confidence placed in him when he was granted a commission in the U. S. Navy by attempting to steal a government 
computer. As a result he was discharged from the Navy under other than honorable terms. He has concealed his criminal conduct from his wife, parents, and 
children for years. He remains concerned about what effect the discovery of such information would have on his wife's mental health and his parent's physical 
well-being. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also failed to disclose a very recent arrest and conviction during the course of a security clearance eligibility interview with a DSS special agent in 
2002. His explanation that he believes if you're not asked, you shouldn't volunteer information is hardly consistent with the judgment that must be demanded of 
a person who is to be entrusted with the nation's secrets. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in 
activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail </EM>applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> 
</EM>Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in 
this case, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P>
