<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, with an otherwise meritorious work record, has a recurrent history of masturbating in public, most recently in August 1999, which he has not 
disclosed to his employer, court-referred evaluator, and private polygrapher.  Initially concealing his actions from his wife, he has reportedly been forthcoming 
with her, but with no one else.  He continues to withhold the true facts about his actions from his children, his employer, his court-referred evaluator, and his 
private polygrapher out of personal embarrassment and concern for his job and security clearance.  Applicant  fails to mitigate Government concerns over his 
vulnerability to coercion and duress as a result of his continued withholding of the truth about his actions.  Applicant fails also to mitigate security concerns 
associated with his concealing the factual details of his actions associated with his 1999 arrest and earlier incidents in another state from the DSS agents who 
interviewed him before confronted with the facts in his last interview with the DSS polygrapher.  Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on September 9, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2003.  The hearing was 
scheduled and convened on December 17, 2003, to consider whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke 
Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The 
transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on December 29, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend subparagraph 1.c of the SOR to strike the words "signed, sworn statement executed by 
you" and substitute them with the  words "in an interview with another special agent of the Defense Security Service."  There being no objections from 
Applicant, and good cause being shown, Department Counsel's motion was granted.  Applicant's denial of giving a false statement in response to sub-paragraph 1.c was unchanged by the amendment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) been arrested in August 1999 for indecent exposure for masturbating in his car near an elementary school in 
State A, to which he pleaded no contest, was fined $300.00, assessed court costs, and ordered to perform 24 hours of community service, as part of a deferred 
adjudication program, (b) deliberately falsified a signed, sworn statement submitted to an interviewing DSS agent in November 2001 re: the facts covered by 
his August 1999 arrest by denying any exposure of his genitals for masturbating for sexual gratification, &copy;) deliberately falsified statements given to another 
special agent in a December 2001 interview by repeating the same false story regarding the August 1999 incident, (d) been detained by private security guards 
in State B in September 1981 after they discovered his masturbating in a parked car while watching female patrons enter the mall, and (e) masturbated in public 
on at least one other occasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to have engaged in sexual behavior as covered by the acts and incidents covered under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his August 1999 arrest but denied the underlying acts, and denied each of the remaining allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49-year-old sprinkler maintenance technician for a defense contractor who seeks to retain a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the 
SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a technician with a meritorious work record of over 20 years with his current defense contractor.  In February 1999 he had given up smoking to 
help him lose weight.  He kept his smoking resumption from his spouse and his two children, who he had long counseled not to smoke and drink (exs. 1 and 2).  
Both his children are involved in sports.  To avoid being seen by any of his family members, he limited his smoking to his morning work commutes. Applicant 
credits his smoking with his losing about 25 pounds.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While on his way to work in the morning of August 18, 1999, Applicant turned down a side street to find a place to park and smoke.  As he approached an 
elementary school, he turned around and drove out of sight of the school before pulling over to the curb.  After smoking a few cigarettes, he unzipped his pants, 
exposed his genitals, and masturbated (contrary to his insistent claims that he exposed himself just to relieve an itch).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unbeknown to Applicant at the time of the August 1999 incident, a female bystander was  situated outside his car and observed his unzipping his pants and 
stroking his erect sexual organ in a manifestly overt act of masturbation.  This witness (W) then screamed at Applicant to leave the scene immediately, which he 
did.  She also made a note of Applicant's license plate and called "911" to report her observations to the police.  After further investigation, police came to 
Applicant's residence and questioned him about the incident.  Once Applicant confirmed he was at the scene of the reported incident, the police advised him 
there would be an officer out to arrest him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evening of August 23, 1999, other police officers arrived at Applicant's residence and arrested him for indecent exposure and escorted him to the local 
police station where he was formally charged.  Applicant's spouse covered his bail, and he was released from jail the same night.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After appearing in court with his attorney on three occasions in the hopes of plea bargaining his charges Applicant accepted his attorney's advice on his fourth 
such appearance and pleaded no contest to the charge of indecent exposure.  As a condition to the court's deferred adjudication, he was fined $300.00, ordered 
to perform 24 hours of community service, and subjected to required psychological evaluations, in addition to accepting the court's imposed one year of 
supervised probation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was subsequently evaluated by a court-appointed psychologist in October 2000.  In this initial evaluating session, the psychologist recommended 
Applicant take a voluntary polygraph examination under the administering supervision of a polygrapher chosen by the psychologist.  Applicant acceded to the 
psychologist's recommendation and appeared for a scheduled polygraph evaluation in November 2000.  In this polygraph examination, Applicant repeated the 
same innocent explanation of his August 1999 conduct as he has had told his wife and the police: that while parked on the side street in August 1999, he 
scratched his exposed genitals to relieve an itch, and not with the intention of masturbating and exposing his genitals to the woman who observed him (<EM>see</EM> ex. 
2).  Applicant was told by his psychologist that he passed his polygraph test and would not need counseling.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant didn't immediately tell his wife or his employer about his  masturbating actions  for which he was arrested and charged in August 1999.  When up for 
his security update in December 2000, he repeated the same story he told the police and his wife earlier out of concern for his job and clearance (ex. 1).  
Afforded the opportunity to disclose the truth about his actions that prompted his August 1999 arrest in a series of DSS interviews in November 2001, he again 
repeated the same story he had told police, his wife, his private polygrapher and his employer earlier.  In each of these first two sessions with Agent A he failed 
to disclose his acts of masturbation when observed by the female bystander.  He compounded his misstatements in these interviews by his assurances he had 
never previously engaged in any public acts of masturbation for sexual gratification.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Scheduled for a polygraph with Agent B in December 2001, Applicant initially stuck to his same story about his exposing and scratching his genitals to relieve 
an itch.  Only when repeatedly confronted by Agent B about his actions did he choose to become fully candid about not only his August 1999 action, but his 
earlier acts of public masturbation as well in other states.  Specifically, Applicant admitted to not being honest with Agent A about his intentions regarding the 
event leading up to his August 1999 arrest and proceeded to admit that he had been masturbating in his car on the morning of August 18, 1999, when he was 
observed by a female bystander (ex. 2).  Applicant claims he was coerced into making these admissions by the Agent B who denied bathroom and lunch breaks 
and led him in his questioning in search of desired answers (R.T., at 48-49).  Applicant provides no documented proof of agent coercion or improper 
interrogation methods, and his statement contains initials and an acknowledged opportunity to review his statement and make corrections (R.T., at 50-53).  
Applicant failed to delete or alter his admissions, and they are accepted as true (<EM>see </EM>ex. 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also acknowledged to Agent B his masturbating in public on other occasions.  On one of these occasions, he was observed by private security guards 
masturbating in his car in a parking lot of a mall in State B while watching female patrons enter the mall.  He acknowledged, too, to have masturbated in public 
on at least one other occasion, without providing any specifics. In neither of these incidents was Applicant arrested.  Public acts of indecency such as the ones 
Applicant knowingly and willingly performed are generally recognized as illegal in all of the states and must be presumed to be in State B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except for his wife, Applicant has not disclosed his acts of public masturbation for which he was arrested for in August 1999 to either his children, his private 
polygrapher, his professional evaluator, or his employer out of continuing embarrassment and concern about his job and clearance. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Sexual Behavior</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3 Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under  the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By all accounts, Applicant has a meritorious professional record and no history of involvement with law enforcement before his arrest for indecent exposure in 
August 1999.  While it had been many years before he had returned to any acknowledged masturbation in public, he does have some history of similar conduct 
over the past 25 years, including an incident in 1978 or 1979 where he was found masturbating in his car by shopping mall security guards and released. His 
actions raise security concerns about his judgment and reliability under the guidelines covered by Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline D (sexual 
behavior).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his 1999 incident, Applicant withheld his true actions associated with his 1999 arrest and previous such experiences from his wife and children, his 
employer, his court-referred evaluator and the polygrapher who tested his veracity and the first DSS agent who interviewed him in October 2001out of 
embarrassment and concern it might jeopardize his job and clearance.  His actions entitle the Government to invoke two of the disqualifying conditions for 
personal conduct: DC 1 (reliable unfavorable information) and DC  4 (personal conduct that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress).  Applicant's actions raise security concerns as well over his same actions under the sexual behavior guidelines covered by Guideline D.   Applicable 
disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline include: DC 1 (sexual behavior of a criminal nature), DC 3 (sexual behavior that causes the individual to be 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress), and DC 4 (sexual behavior of a public nature).  Applicant admits the encounters and the poor judgment 
reflected in each of them in his post-polygraph interview with Agent B.  Despite Applicant's hearing efforts to recant these admissions (claiming them to be the 
result of coercion and undue influence on him over an intense, grueling post-polygraph interview with Agent B), his post-polygraph admissions and 
explanations were accepted as true (ex. 2) under all the circumstances considered.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant elected to tell his spouse about his sexual-related incidents once his clearance update commenced in 2000, he has provided none of these 
details to his children for understandable reasons, nor to his employer, court-referred evaluator, and private polygrapher.   Applicant justifies his failure to come 
forward with corrected explanations of his covered incidents as necessary to protect him from further embarrassment with his employer, as well as the potential 
loss of his job and clearance.  With only his spouse since notified, the risks of any recurrent vulnerability remain and cannot be minimized or managed for 
security clearance purposes.  Applicant may not avail himself of any of the mitigating conditions based on the record evidence and fails to absolve himself of 
adverse risks of coercion, exploitation or duress (prerequisites for invoking MC 4 of the Guidelines for so long as he continues to cover up his actions with 
members of his family (his children), his employer, his court-referred evaluator and  his private polygrapher.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's recurrent public indecency actions in 1999 and earlier acknowledged incidents,  Applicant 
fails to demonstrate that his acts are sufficiently isolated to enable him to carry his evidentiary burden.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the 
underlying conduct covered by subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e of Guideline E  and subparagraph</SPAN> 2.a of Guideline D.</P> 
 
<P>Di<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fficult to reconcile with principles of clearance eligibility, too, are Applicant's repeated misrepresentations to interviewing DSS agents (not to mention his 
spouse, children, employer, his court-referred evaluator and private polygrapher) about his sexually-oriented actions that resulted in his August 1999 arrest, and 
his prior history of acts of masturbation while parked on public streets. Embarrassment and concern over how it might affect his job and clearance are 
understandable, but are generally insufficient to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission of material facts considered necessary to complete a security 
clearance investigation.  Government may invoke DC 3 (providing false and misleading information to an investigator) and DC 5 (pattern dishonesty or rule 
violations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines covering Guideline E.  Because Applicant did not acknowledge his acts of masturbation associated with his 1999 
arrest or previous acts of masturbation in a public facility until confronted with the material facts by Agent B in a third DSS interview in November 2001, he 
may not take advantage of the prompt, good faith mitigation provisions of MC 3 (prompt, good faith disclosure before being confronted).  Our Appeal Board 
has been very explicit about the unavailability of this mitigation condition without both prongs being met.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, including Applicant's meritorious professional history and unblemished criminal record (save for his 1999 encounter), 
Applicant's mitigation efforts are still insufficient to (a) surmount his repeated misstatements about his actions associated with his 1999 arrest and previous acts 
for sexual gratification in public facilities or roads and (b) restore his judgment and reliability to levels required for eligibility to hold a security clearance.  
Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.b and 1.c of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of 
the Directive.</SPAN></P>
