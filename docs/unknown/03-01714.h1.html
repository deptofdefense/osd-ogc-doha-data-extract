<P>Applicant incurred 13 delinquent debts.  In the past three years she has used her savings and current income, and her husband's periodic income, to pay seven 
delinquent debts, and make installment payments on the remaining six debts, of which four are student loan debts.  Applicant mitigated the financial 
consideration security concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE </SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
<P>On October 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and notarized statement, dated November 21, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  She requested a hearing.  This case was assigned 
to me February 3, 2004.  On February 23, 2004, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing date for March 10, 2004.  On that date, I convened the 
hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented six exhibits, all 
of which were admitted into evidence.  Applicant submitted 11 exhibits (four at the hearings, and seven subsequently to the hearing without objection by the 
Government), which were admitted into evidence.  I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on March 17, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (subparagraphs 1.a. to 1.m.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 35 years old.  She is a mechanical engineer working for a defense contractor.  She is married.  Her husband has children from his prior marriage the 
custody of whom Applicant and her husband are attempting to obtain in a court custody action.  Applicant paid $8,500 in legal fees before the hearing to start 
that action.  Applicant moved to her present residence three years ago after living in a more expensive eastern area of the country.  In that location Applicant 
depended on her credit cards to make purchases.  Presently, Applicant does not use credit cards and has purchased a home. (Tr. 22, 32 to 38, 52, 55, 62, 78)</P> 
<P>Applicant is using her money from a &sect; 401K account to pay her outstanding debts.  She is also making monthly payments from her income on a number of her 
delinquent debts.  Her husband's income is used to pay the student loans for which they co-signed.  He also works as a security guard while going to college.  
Applicant's husband graduates in 2005.  He has endured several periods of unemployment which prevented him from making full payments on his college loan 
debts.  Applicant owns two cars which are paid for fully.  Applicant paid off several debts and closed several accounts before the SOR was issued. (Tr. 21, 22, 
37, 48 to 52, 56; Exhibit 6)</P> 
<P>Applicant's debts and their current status are as follows:</P>

<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id</EM>. At 527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>&sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility 
for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds 
from financially profitable criminal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The behavior was not recent.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the allegation involving Guideline F, the Government established its case.  Applicant is delinquent on 13 accounts.  They were incurred over 
several years through the use of credit cards.  Three debts are student loans for her husband's education, for which Applicant co-signed on the loans.  
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 3 apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the application of Mitigating Conditions (MC), MC 1 does not apply in this case because Applicant's failure to pay these debts was a continuing 
course of conduct.  The directive is focused on financial condition.  Applicant still has debts even though incurred some time ago.  Therefore, her poor financial 
condition is recent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant paid several debts not listed in the SOR, while at the same time engaging in a plan to pay the debts listed in the SOR, all of which she 
admitted in her Answer.  Those debts that she has not paid she has an installment payment plan in effect.  All of these debts occurred over three years ago 
before Applicant's move to a less expensive living cost area of the country.  Her husband's periodic unemployment diminished her ability to repay these debts 
sooner.  However, the debts were incurred because Applicant relied on credit cards to finance her living standards.  Applicant is withdrawing her savings from 
her &sect;401K retirement plan to pay these debts, and has done that in part to date.  Mitigating Conditions (MC) 6 applies.  Of the debts alleged in the SOR, 
Applicant paid in full or settled fully subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.m.  She has payment plans in effect for the remaining debts, including 
her husband's college loans (subparagraphs 1.f., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l.).  Payment plans are also in effect for two credit card debts (subparagraphs 1.a., and 1.e.).  I 
conclude Applicant has gotten her delinquent debt problem under control and has worked diligently to resolve these debts.  Therefore, considering all of the 
evidence, I conclude the guideline for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P>
