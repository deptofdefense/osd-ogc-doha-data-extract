<P>In 1998, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection due to medical bills.  Four years later, Applicant's husband was involved in a serious accident resulting in 
the loss of his job and loss of pay for six months.  Applicant owes four debts totaling less than $5,000. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or 
extenuate the negative security implications stemming from her financial difficulties. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On Decmeber 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-24668.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Security 
concerns were alleged under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations). DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 13, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On February 25, 2005, I was assigned the case. On March 9, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on March 23, 2005.  On March 31, 2005, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old clerk typist/program administrator who has worked for a defense contractor since December 2002, and is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance. Applicant is regarded by those who know her as having an upbeat personality, a "get it done" attitude, extremely trustworthy and reliable, a person 
of strong character, with a strong work ethic, and is an invaluable asset to the group and company.  She is dependable, adaptable, and willing to learn.  She 
meets new challenges with enthusiasm and tenacity.  She is highly productive. One of her work evaluations states she exhibits more initiative and hard work 
ethics then has been seen in a long time.  Another evaluation states she is one of the best employees the rater had ever had the pleasure of supervising.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, Applicant's husband, a professional truck driver, had a fainting or dizzy spell.  His primary care physician sent him to a cardiologist.  He was treated 
for a blood pressure issue.  He would get dizzy when he bents over (Tr. 33).  Medical bills were incurred which were not paid by his insurance. He was given 
blood pressure mediation and, following a Department of Transportation physical, he was cleared to return to driving. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1998, due to the medical bills, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In September 1998, their liabilities were 
discharged.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's husband had 18 accident free years with a company as a truck driver. In November 2002, her husband was involved in a serious accident.  He 
crossed an overpass over the interstate highway and started into a curve where two trucks were illegally parked.  The tractor he was driving flipped on its side 
and proceeded down the highway.  Serious damage was done to the trucks and Applicant's husband.  Two weeks after the accident, he was terminated from his 
job and received no income from November 2002 through May 2003. The accident was ruled not her husband's fault (Gov Ex 2).  Prior to the accident, 
Applicant had not been working outside the home. Following the accident, additional financial problems were incurred when her husband's court ordered child 
support payment was increased to $567 per month. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2002, Applicant obtained her current job.  For six months, Applicant's family of four lived on approximately $1,000 per month from her job until 
her husband's disability pay started.  Her husband is 100% disabled.  In May 2003, Applicant's husband  began to receive $1,529 monthly disability payments.  
In addition to Applicant's full time job with the government contractor, she has taken additional jobs to raise money. First she was cleaning homes and then 
doing tax preparation work for additional money.  They also moved into a smaller house to save rent money. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the accident, her husband sustained constriction of the main artery to the brain; injury to two cervical disks; a closed head injury; a broken right hand and 
wrist; and a hernia caused by the seat belt (App Ex A). Her husband's disability has required numerous hospitalizations, medications, and doctors' visits.  He 
was being treated for seizures, migraines, neck pain, severe mood swings and depression, of which he had no history of prior the accident (App Ex A).  Her 
husband, who is 44 years old, will never again return to work in any capacity (Tr 24).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2004, her husband's had his most recent surgery.  Five out of seven days, her husband stays in bed until she gets him up.  The other two days, he 
is able to get up and function until she comes home for lunch to make sure he has eaten and taken his medications (Tr. 45).  He currently takes 18-20 
medications. He falls, he staggers, he has seizures, and suffers memory loss.  Prior to the accident, her husband weighed 210 pounds.  He now weights 142 
pounds.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant hired an attorney to seek  payment from her husband's former employer for lost wages and past and future doctor and medical bills. Applicant 
presented documentation showing more than $6,000 paid for medication to one pharmacy (App Ex A). Their attorney hoped for resolution of the workers 
compensation case within three months following the date of the hearing. Applicant has not paid certain medical bills anticipating her husband's employer or 
workman's compensation will be required to pay them. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was paying the credit card debt (SOR 1.c) until the company would no longer accept the minimal payments she was able to make.  She had offered 
payments of $50 per month, which the company found unacceptable. The debt was approximately $3,300. The company has recently offered to settle for half 
of the debt.  When Applicant was unable to make her car payments (SOR 1.b), she voluntarily returned the vehicle.  Following the repossession, Applicant 
owed $5,200. The creditor has offered to settle the debt for half of the debt.  However, Applicant's current finances are not sufficient to pay the amounts 
requested.  After the repossession, Applicant purchased an old car with a very small payment (Tr. 69).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR lists seven debts totaling approximately $9,000.  The current status of those debts follows: </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Additionally, an applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-24668.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under 
agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties 
is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her 
finances so as to meet her financial obligations. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Directive E.2.A.6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant owed seven debts totaling approximately 
$9,000. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1 <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>) apply to these debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has paid three of the debts (SOR paragraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g). Mitigating Conditions (MC) 6 (E2.A6.1.3.6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, Applicant's husband, a professional truck driver, had a fainting or dizzy spell.  He incurred numerous medical bills attempting to determine the 
problem.  In May 1998, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection due to the medical bills.  I find MC3  (E2.A6.1.3.3 <EM>The conditions that resulted in the 
behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation)</EM>) applicable to this bankruptcy which was also caused by medical debts incurred to discover the cause of Applicant's husband's dizziness.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the bankruptcy, they were getting back on their feet.  They purchased a car and were paying their debts. November 2002, her husband was involved 
in a serious accident. Following the accident, he falls, he staggers, he has seizures, and suffers memory loss. He suffers from  migraines, neck pain, severe 
mood swings and depression, and has experienced substantial weight loss. He is currently on 18 to 20 medications.  Applicant and her husband have already 
paid more than $6,000 for medication. He has now been declared to be disabled and will never again be able to return to work.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two weeks after the accident, he was terminated from his job and received no income from November 2002 through May 2003, when he began to receive 
monthly disability payments.  Immediately following the accident, Applicant obtained her current job and began second jobs as the household's only source of 
income.  She took steps to reduce their debts.  She returned their car and bought a much less expensive car.  They moved into a smaller house to save on rent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her two largest creditors (SOR 1.b, $5,200 and SOR 1.c, $3,200) have both offered to settle their accounts for half of what is owed.  However, Applicant has 
not had sufficient funds to accept their offers.  She and her husband have hired an attorney to seek  payment from her husband's former employer for lost 
wages, past and future doctor and medical bills. Applicant has two other medical bills totaling approximately $330, which she has not paid anticipating her 
husband's employer or workman's compensation will be required to pay them. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owes four debts which total less than $5,000, if she is able to accept the settlement offers.  If she is successful in having the two small medical bills 
paid by workman's compensation or her husband's prior employer, she has only two debts.  Her inability to pay these debts were the direct result of her 
husband's accident.  I find MC3  (E2.A6.1.3.3 <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>) applicable to the four debts.  I find for Applicant as to financial 
considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
