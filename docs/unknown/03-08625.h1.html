<P>Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on three occasions; he  used marijuana once in 1998/99; and he used cocaine on several 
occasions between 1999 and August 2002. His drug abuse only stopped when he tested positive on a random urinalysis at work. He misled a drug counselor and 
a  Defense Security Service Special Agent about the extent of his drug use following the positive urinalysis. Although he called his wife, friends, and co-workers to testify on his behalf, their testimony clearly established that he continues to mislead them about the extent of his drug abuse. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline H for drug involvement. Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on June 1, 2004, 
admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on December 8, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on December 8, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 30, 2004. The 
hearing commenced as scheduled, but was continued at Applicant's request following completion of the Government's case until January 14, 2005.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The 
hearing was reconvened and completed on the continued date. The government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, called five witnesses to testify on his behalf, and offered 13 documentary 
exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-13, and admitted into the record without objection. The final transcript was received on January 28, 
2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Before the introduction of evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to allege conduct under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. Consistent with 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 3 (Additional Procedural Guidance), paragraph E3.1.17, and over an objection from Applicant, the 
amendment was allowed as stated in the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons </EM>(Appellate Exhibit II). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, and consideration of 
the testimony presented, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 41 years old, married, has no children, and has been employed as an engineer by various defense contractors since 1985. He was initially issued a 
security clearance sometime in the mid 1980s that for administrative reasons lapsed sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. He was again issued a security 
clearance in 1997 and has possessed that clearance since. Applicant received a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in May 1985, and a master of 
science degree in software engineering in April 2003. The work performance appraisals he submitted and the testimony of his witnesses attests to reputation for 
being a competent and professional engineer who is perceived as reliable, trustworthy, and a valuable asset to his employer. Applicant has recently passed state 
administered engineering tests as part of the process for him to obtain a state engineering license.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant and his wife have been a couple for the past 24 years, although they did not actually marry until September 1991. They both testified about their 
relationship and the strain that was placed upon it apparently because of conflicting work schedules that caused them to see very little of each other. They 
estimated the problems in their relationship began in about 1999. They participated in 20 counseling sessions between June 2001 and February 2002 that began 
to resolve the difficulties they were having. Applicant's wife testified their relationship has improved even more since Applicant tested positive for cocaine in 
his system in a work administered random urinalysis in August 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to marital problems, Applicant dealt with the stress related to his mother's illnesses and eventual death in 2003. Applicant's mother initially lived in 
a neighboring state and he would travel to her house on occasion to provide assistance to her. In approximately January 2003, he found her living in squalor, 
suffering from a terminal illness, and completely unable to care for herself. Applicant and his wife moved her in to live with them beginning in January 2003, 
and cared for her for a couple of months until she went to live with other relatives until the time of her death. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in May 1985, and was placed on probation for one year, ordered to attend an alcohol 
awareness program, and had his driving privileges temporarily suspended. He was again charged with DUI in November 1985,<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> was found not guilty following 
a trial, and adamantly denies that he was intoxicated. He explains the 0.14 blood alcohol concentration he once stated he had tested at following this arrest to his 
consumption of alcohol following the automobile accident that led to his arrest. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was last charged with DUI on November 16, 1997. Although Applicant denies he was intoxicated at the time of his arrest, the police reports (GE 7) 
provide sufficient evidence of the arresting officer's observations and conversations with Applicant to find he was operating a motor vehicle while under the 
influence of alcohol. Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving on February 18, 1998, and was sentenced to supervised probation for 12 months, ordered to pay 
fines and court costs totaling $656.00, perform 100 hours community service, and attend a victim awareness program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's witnesses were each questioned concerning their observations of his use of alcohol. Each of them who has ever been in a position to see him 
consume alcohol describe him as no more than a social drinker. None have ever observed him under the influence of alcohol or had any occasion to suspect that 
he may have a problem controlling his alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant tested positive for the presence of the cocaine metabolite in his system during a randomly administered urinalysis ordered by his employer on August 
20, 2002. As a result of the positive test, he was referred to the company's employee assistance program. An assessment was conducted by a licensed clinical 
social worker employed by the program on November 7 and 14, 2002, during which Applicant denied ever using any controlled substance. (GE 6, items 5 and 
11) The social worker concluded: "(I)t appears that this patient is not a drug user and has no intention to begin drug use in the future"; and "(T)his patient 
appears to have no impairment in his judgement or reliability."  (GE 6, items 12 and 13) It was recommended that he attend two drug education classes and 
submit to six random drug tests.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on February 27, 2003. (GE 3) During the interview he initially claimed 
the positive urinalysis resulted from his one and only use of cocaine that occurred at a party where he sniffed two lines of the drug provided by an individual he 
claimed to know only casually. He affirmatively stated: "(T)his is the only time that I have ever used any type of illegal drug."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While the record is silent about how Applicant's change of position came about, Applicant later admitted during the interview that he had not initially been 
honest about his use of illegal drugs. He thereafter admitted having used marijuana on one occasion in about 1998-99, and cocaine on five or six occasions 
between 1999/2000 and August 2002. Applicant claims he has not used any controlled substance since August 2002, and submitted the results of three hair 
analyses for the presence of drugs that he voluntarily, though randomly,<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> had performed on March 3, 2003, May 5, 2004, and December 7, 2004. (AE 7)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel inquired of each Applicant witness as to their knowledge of Applicant's drug abuse. While each testified they were aware of the positive 
urinalysis, none of them indicated knowledge of other drug abuse on Applicant's part. Applicant's friend for more than 20 years specifically testified he was 
aware of the positive urinalysis, did not know of any other time when Applicant abused drugs, and that the abuse of drugs would be out of character for 
Applicant. (Tr. p. 41)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Most notably, the following testimony was provided by Applicant's wife:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q. . . . What did he tell you about the use of drugs?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A. He admitted it to me shortly after the occurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q. What did he say?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A. He came home from work and said he had gotten drug tested and it came back positive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q. Did he tell you where he consumed the drugs?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A. He said he was out and we were not, you know, our relationship was not, was still, like I said a work in progress and he had an opportunity that presented it 
to himself and it was poor judgment on his part and it's something that happened.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">* * *  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q. So, as far as you know, he has only used cocaine one time in his life?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A. As far as I know, yes. (Tr. p. 30)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline H, 
pertaining to drug involvement, and Guideline G, pertaining to alcohol consumption, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">case against him.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent 
behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to 
protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although there is insufficient evidence to conclude the November 1985 DUI charge was valid, Applicant was convicted of DUI arising from the May 1985 
arrest and reckless driving arising from the November 1997 DUI arrest. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as 
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM> applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's two alcohol related incidents occurred twelve years apart. There have been no arrests or other reported alcohol related incidents since 1997. His 
witnesses, including his wife, describe him as no more than a social drinker, and none have had any occasion to suspect he has a problem controlling his 
consumption of alcohol. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>; MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of 
years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety </EM>apply. Guideline G is decided for 
Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. 
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana once in 1998/1999, and cocaine five or six times between about 1999/2000 and when he tested positive for the drug in August 2002. 
He possessed a security clearance when he consumed those drugs. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse </EM>applies.<A HREF="03-08625.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The positive urinalysis and at least partial resolution of the stresses Applicant was experiencing while abusing drugs appear to have resulted in his decision to 
forsake drug abuse in the future. The negative hair screens strongly indicate he has not abused any controlled substance since August 2002, and his and his 
wife's testimonies provide a strong indication he will not resort to drug abuse in the future. Accordingly, Applicant is entitled to application of MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug 
involvement was not recent</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, in all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes 
we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Having done so, I find Applicant's continuing lack of honesty and candor about his drug 
abuse weighs heavily against reposing in him the trust and confidence that must be accorded to one who is to be given access to the nation's secrets.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant lied to the social worker in November 2002 about his use of drugs. His denial undoubtedly factored in her determination that he was not a drug user 
and had no impairment in judgment and reliability. Likewise, her recommendation that he required nothing but the most minimal drug education was almost 
certainly influenced by his untruthfulness. He continued lying about his drug use when he was initially interviewed by a DSS Special Agent in February 2003. 
Applicant's failure to discuss the full extent of his drug abuse with his character witnesses may be understandable; however, the fact that he continues, at least 
as of the date of the hearing, to mislead his wife about his drug abuse reflects negatively on his integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence of record in this case, the "whole person" considerations, including Applicant's continued display of lack of integrity, honesty, 
and trustworthiness, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns 
caused by his drug involvement. He has neither overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion on this issue. Guideline H is 
decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P>
