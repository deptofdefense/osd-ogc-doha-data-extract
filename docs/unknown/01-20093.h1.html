<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>From age 14 until 1999, the Applicant had a serious alcohol problem.  Since April 1999, the Applicant has attended treatment, actively participated in AA, has a 
favorable prognosis, maintained his sobriety, and abstained from all use of alcohol. The Applicant has changed his life style and, knowing he is an alcoholic, 
knows the effect on his life another drink would bring.  He does not want to return to his previous lifestyle, has established a new way of life, has reformed 
from his past actions, and has no intention of drinking in the future. When the Applicant completed his Standard Form 86, he listed some of his arrests but 
failed to list three alcohol related offenses. The Applicant's explanation for failing to list the offenses was accepted.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 26, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  On April 
15, 2002, the Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2002.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 
11, 2002, scheduling the hearing which was held on June 19, 2002. The Government's case consisted of six exhibits (Gov. Ex.).  The Applicant relied on his 
own testimony and one exhibit (App Ex).  A transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received on June 27, 2002. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The record was held open to allow the Applicant to submit additional documents. For good cause, the time period to submit additional documents was extended 
until July 22, 2002. The documents were received in a timely manner.  On July 29, 2002, Department Counsel commented  on the Applicant's post-hearing 
filings, but made no objection to the material's admission.  The submissions have been marked and admitted as App Ex B. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The SOR alleges excessive alcohol consumption (Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and personal conduct (Guideline E).  The Applicant admits the 
alcohol related incidents and denies his failure to list three alcohol related arrests.  He denies the events create doubt about his judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness, or display questionable judgement, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>The Applicant is twenty four-years-old, has worked for a defense contractor since May 1999, in a temporary position, and as a full time employee since March 
2000 and is seeking a security clearance.  The Applicant is a very reliable, valued, outstanding employee, of good character who has received letters of 
accommodations from his company. (tr. 116, 122, App Ex A) </P> 
<P>The Applicant acknowledges he is an alcoholic (Gov. Ex. 2, p. 3) and cannot drink alcohol in the future.  Since age 14, his problems with alcohol have been 
constant until April 1999. (Gov. Ex 2, p.9)  At the height of his drinking, he would drink a fifth of liquor and a twelve pack of beer  on an average day. (Gov. 
Ex 2, p.3)</P> 
<P>The Applicant used alcohol to excess while in high school.  In 1992, at age 15, the Applicant started attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  He did 
not get much out of these AA meetings.  He sat in the back of the room, did not participate, and left the minute he was free to go. The Applicant chose to stop 
using illegal drugs in the 10<SUP>th</SUP> grade, after seeing a counselor.  However, the Applicant would occasionally use illegal drugs when he was drinking.  Sometimes 
he learned he had used illegal drugs while drinking after being told later by his friends.  He had no memory of having done so.  He chose to quit using illegal 
drugs because they were illegal and unacceptable.  He continued with to use alcohol thinking it more socially acceptable. </P> 
<P>In 1993, he was arrested for shoplifting when he attempted to steal beer from a convenience store.  After being found guilty, he was ordered to attend 
counseling and was fined $250.00.  He referenced this arrest in his August 2000 (Gov. Ex. 2) and September 2000 (Gov. Ex. 3) statements to the Defense 
Security Service (DSS) special agent.  When he completed his Security Clearance Application, Standard (Std.) Form 86, he was not sure if this arrest occurred 
when he was age 15 or 16 and so did not list it on the form. </P> 
<P>During 1994, the Applicant received treatment for approximately one year from a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a condition diagnosed, in part, 
as alcohol abuse. The Applicant has seen this LCSW periodically since that time, last saw the Applicant in June 2002, and last talked with the Applicant in July 
2002. </P> 
<P>In 1996, he was cited by his college for drinking alcohol in the student lounge.  As a result, he was required to meet with a college alcohol counselor.  In March 
1997, he was arrested for petit larceny/misdemeanor theft for stealing cigarettes and other items from a convenience store.  At the time of the incident, he was 
extremely drunk and in a "blackout"<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> state. (Gov. Ex. 3, 5)  He remembers the incident only from what others have told him. (Gov. Ex. 3, p. 2.)  He was fined 
$100.00 plus $109.00 court costs, ordered to serve 30 days in jail (26 days suspended), and to complete the youthful offenders program. He was also banned 
from going to the convenience store or other convenience stores of the same type.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In February 1998, he was arrested for petit larceny/misdemeanor theft for stealing cigarettes and a pack of gum from the same type of convenience store where 
he had previously been banned.  He was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.  He was fined $500.00 ($400.00 suspended) plus $160.00 
court costs, ordered to serve 90 days in jail (70 days suspended), and barred for entering any of the same type of convenience store in the future.  He received 
one year probation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Within two weeks, still in February 1998, he was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), he pleaded guilty, was fined $500.00, ordered to serve five 
days in jail and attend a one day session of ASAP (Alcohol Safety Action Program).  When he appeared at his court date there was no record of him on the 
docket.  He did plead guilty and was told his home state which had issued his driver's license would be notified of the incident so his driver's license could be 
revoked.  The notification never arrived and the revocation occurred.  The Applicant made a number of calls to determine the status of his letter of notification.  
Whenever he called, he was told there was no record of him in their system. (Gov. Ex. 4, p.2)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In April 1998--approximately one week after being barred from all convenience stores of that type, the Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal 
trespass.  The Applicant was sober and up studying for a test when he unwisely chose to go buy cigarettes at a convenience store of the same type from which 
he had been barred.  He had left the store without incident after being questioned by the attendant.  He was found guilty, fined $100.00, sentenced to 30 days in 
jail which was suspended upon good behavior for one year and upon being restricted from entering any of the same type of convenience stores for one year for 
any reason. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In June 1998, the Applicant was issued a show cause summons for entering the same type of store.  In August 1998, he was found guilty of contempt, and 
ordered to pay $130.00 court cost, and to serve 20 days in jail beginning in August 1998.  On the day he was to begin serving his jail sentence he appealed the 
matter.  In October 1998, he was found guilty of two counts of contempt, ordered to pay $576.00 in costs, and sentenced to 44 days in jail to begin in December 
1998 and end in mid January 1999. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In February 1999<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, the Applicant was charged with indecent exposure at Mardi Gras.  He was drunk and exposing himself for Mardi Gras beads. (tr. 41) The 
Applicant does not remember the arrest. (tr. 41)  Most of what he knows about the evening's events is from what his friends have told him.  He has little 
independent knowledge other than he was released on bail the following morning and thought he had been held for public drunkenness.  Near the end of his 
drinking, he was a "blackout" drinker and the "blackouts" occurred often. (Gov. Ex. 2, p. 3)  His impression was that, although held over night in the drunk 
tank, he had not been arrested. (Gov. Ex. 4, p. 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After spending the night in jail in the drunk tank, his friends or family paid his bail and he was released.  When released, the Applicant did not go before a 
judge, does not remember being issued a ticket or summons, and was told he did not have to come back for a court date.  He never returned to New Orleans and 
has never received any further communication from the jurisdiction about his incident.  He repaid his friends or family the bail money. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When the DSS special agent informed the Applicant about the arrest, the Applicant was surprised and uncertain of what it was. (Gov. Ex. 4, p.3)  He had 
forgotten about the incident and remembers it only when questioned about it. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In February 1999, approximately two weeks after the Mardi Gras incident, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  This 
arrest was not in the same state as his prior DUI and no record of the prior DUI could be located when the Applicant came to court on the February 1999 DWI. 
(tr. 37)  At the time of his arrest his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .22%.  After being found guilty he was fined $500.00, sentenced to 30 days in jail 
(suspended), ordered to participate in the state ASAP, and his driver's license was suspended for one year.  He attended a 12-week alcohol education and 
counseling program as part of ASAP.  The Applicant did not consider ASAP to be counseling which he saw as one-on-one or small group involvement.  The 
Applicant satisfied all ASAP obligations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">From March 1, 1999 to April 12, 1999, he attended counseling due to his excessive use of alcohol.  On April 12, 1999, when his parents had him transferred to 
an alcohol detoxification program nearer their home.  On April 19, 1999, the Applicant's girl friend and fraternity brothers intervened and called his parents to 
come to the university and get him due to his excessive alcohol use. (tr. 45)  He withdrew from classes on that date.  He was in his junior year at the time.  
Since leaving college, he no longer associates with his college friends.  His last drink of alcohol occurred on that day--April 19, 1999. (tr. 46)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As of the Spring of 1999, just prior to the intervention, the Applicant--age 21--was drinking daily and binge drinking.  He states near the end of his drinking 
he was drinking heavily, some times consuming 40 beers for days at a time (Gov. Ex. 6, p. 4) and much of his memory about what happened during this time is 
gone. (Gov. Ex. 4, p.3)  His drinking started due to peer pressure at social occasions and grew to where it had to have alcohol and craved it. (Gov. Ex. 2, p. 8) 
His drinking had adversely affected his health to the point he was vomiting blood.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">From April 1999 to December 1999, he was treated by the same LCSW who had treated him in 1994 for a condition diagnosed, in part, as alcohol abuse.  The 
first few months of treatment entailed out patient counseling and medication for depression and alcohol withdrawal.  The LCSW last saw the Applicant in June 
2002 and last talked with him in July 2002.  In July 2002, the counselor completed a substance abuse evaluation (App Ex B) of the Applicant stating:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">. . . (the Applicant) has accomplished all of the tasks expected to be completed to ensure long-term recovery from alcoholism.  Furthermore, he has developed 
into a healthy, responsible, and mature individual. I found the dedication and support offered by (Applicant's) family, friends, and co-workers remarkable.  I do 
not think (Applicant's) lack of current attendance in AA detracts from the fact that he lives his life according to the principles taught in AA.  In fact, 
(Applicant's) growth through AA demonstrates why I continue to send people to AA.  I applaud his ability to make use of what works in AA and successfully 
move on with his life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1999, the Applicant returned to AA, got a sponsor, and became very involved in the program.  He became extremely active in the group, attending daily AA 
meetings for two years, during the first year and a half of attendance he missed only three or four days.  He attended the world conference of AA in another 
state, organized AA banquets at hotels, and helping other young people's groups put on AA banquets. (tr. 85) After a year and a half attend the one AA group, 
he stopped going because he did not agree with the conduct of some of the members of his home group.  Specifically, older men attending the meetings were 
having sex with underage women.  In April 1999, he first lived with his parents when he returned from school until he moved out and moved in with his AA 
sponsor. (tr. 47)  At the hearing, the Applicant produced "chits" or tokens showing his involvement with AA.  His token for his longest period of abstinence<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
was for 18 months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He left the one group and joined another group for six months.  He was the youngest person in the new group by 15 to 20 years.  The Applicant left the group 
because he did not have much in common with the group and because he had learned through the program what he needed to keep himself sober. (tr. 49) He 
currently has an AA  sponsor (tr. 51) and has talked with his sponsor within the past two months (tr. 54), and carries his sponsor's telephone number in his 
wallet.  He realizes he can return to AA should the need arise.  He still has a network of individuals in AA he can call upon for support as well as talking to his 
counselor.  He continues to "take a personal inventory" regularly and maintains a diary.  He knows and recites the serenity prayer. (tr. 83)  The Applicant stated 
(tr. 53):</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   I haven't written off Alcoholics Anonymous.  I've learned a lot of valuable lessons there, and I still continue to follow a lot of the principles that I learned 
there of how to keep yourself sober. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has learned he needs to avoid bars and clubs<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>; to avoid old situations; that he cannot drink (tr. 57); that alcohol is dangerous for him (tr. 66); that 
he needed to start fresh and needed to separate himself from his old friends; and talks with a higher power to keep himself straight.  He chooses not to drink 
because he enjoys his job, the relationship he has with his family and new friends.  He has a strong work ethic and is dedicated to his work.  He has no desire to 
go back to the way he was. (tr. 58)  He no longer has any contact with his fraternity brothers and has dissociated himself from prior friends.  He stays busy 
studying (he's taking university courses), exercising, reading, using computers, and being outdoors. His family, friends and managers at work know of his 
alcohol addiction. He has grown a great deal since his last use of alcohol. (tr. 65)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant stated (tr. 78) his life when he was drinking was </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">. . . completely miserable.  I was sick.  I'd wake up not knowing what exactly I'd done the night before.  I hurt people.  I got in fights.  I did things that were just 
knuckle-headed.  I was not a reasonable person, and you know, I've turned my life around.  I'm doing the right thing now.  I'm not the same person that I was 
before . . . </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant is very happy with his life and job.  Through his involvement in AA, he is aware of the trigger that would lead to his return to drinking.  He 
knows all that makes him happy will disappear if he takes another drink. (Gov. Ex 2, p. 2) As of August 2000 (Gov. Ex. 2), the Applicant regretted his past 
conduct and stated:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have established a new way of life and have reformed from the actions of my past.  I wake up today with a clear head and strong understanding of what is 
important to me.  I love my job and my country . . . I am an alcoholic and I know that if I pick up another drink that I will hurt myself and all that I have worked 
for in the last 15+ months.  I do not want to go back to the way that I was with my drinking and will do all in my power not to go back there.  I have learned to 
live life sober and will continue to do so . . . I do not plan to drink at all in the future. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In February 2000, when the Applicant completed his Std. Form 86 he answered "yes" to question 24. concerning his police record related to alcohol and drug 
offenses and listed three arrests but failed to list three other alcohol related offenses.  He listed his March 1997 and February 1998 petit larcenies and his 
February 1999 DWI and in response to question 26 listed the March 1998 trespassing arrest.  However, he failed to list his 1993 shoplifting arrest, his February 
1998 DUI, and his arrest at Marti Gras for indecent exposure. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant failed to list his 1993 shoplifting at a convenience store because he thought it was beyond the scope<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the investigation.  Although question 24 
asked if the Applicant had "ever" been charged with or arrested for alcohol or drug offenses.  He thought he was to list all arrests after the age of 16, and he 
believed this shoplifting occurred when he was 15.  The Applicant does not know if his misunderstanding about listing arrests after age 16 came from what he 
had read before he completed the form, or from the software module when he completed the form, or something he was told by the Security Office. (tr. 72)  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When questioned about his arrests by the DSS special agent, the Applicant chose to reveal the shoplifting out of an abundance of caution still believing it to be 
beyond the scope of inquiry.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to question 43, General Remarks, the Applicant stated he was not positive of the exact dates but estimated as best as 
possible as to when the events occurred.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant was completing the paperwork he wanted to make sure he got all the dates and incidents right and to make sure he recorded everything.  He 
talked with his father about his past arrests and also went through the documents and personal records stored in his apartment and also those stored at his 
father's home.  The Applicant told his alcohol counselor he was completing the paperwork and wanted to make sure everything was correct.  His counselor told 
the Applicant he(the counselor) knew someone who could run a check of the Applicant's police record. (tr. 27) A check of the Applicant's records failed to 
reveal the February 1998 DUI arrest.  The Applicant did not believe he had to list the arrest because of the lack of a record.  In his August 2000 interview with 
the DSS special agent he was asked for more detail about this arrest, which he disclosed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he completed his Std. Form 86, he was under the impression that he was to list arrests that were on his police record and he had made numerous calls 
trying to get information concerning his February 1998 DUI and was told there was no record of him in the system.  He failed to list the 1998 DUI because there 
was no record of it when he went to court for his 1999 DWI and no record of it appeared when a record check was made prior to him completing the form. (tr. 
39)  He failed to list his Marti Gras incident because he forgot about it when he completed the form.  He did not remember the incident until asked about it 
during a Defense Security Service (DSS) interview.  His memory of the arrest was non existent, but did not believe he was charged or convicted of anything.  
He acknowledged he spent the night in the drunk tank and was release the next day.  The Applicant, now knowing the security investigation process better, 
wishes he had provided more detail when he first submitted his Std. Form 86. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption (Guideline G) </STRONG> The Concern:  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption.  From 1991 until April 1999, the Applicant had a serious 
problem with alcohol.  The Applicant's alcohol problems started in high school when he drank due to peer pressure in social settings.  It progressed to the point 
that, by April 1999, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">just prior to his stopping drinking, he was binge drinking (DC 5), drinking heavily for days--at times consuming 40 beers--and drinking to 
the point of blackouts.  Much of his memory about what happened during this time is gone.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and 5<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before becoming sober he was arrested numerous times.  He was arrested for shoplifting in 1993, March 1997, and February 1998.  In February 1998, he was 
arrested for DUI.  A year later--February 1999--he was arrested for DWI.  His BAC at the February 1999 arrest was .22%, which indicates he was a 
maintenance drinker supporting his claim he was daily drinking heavily.  His last arrest occurred in the Spring of 1999 during Mardi Gras. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During 1994 and 
again from April 1999 until December 1999, the Applicant received treatment from a License Clinical Social Worker for a condition diagnosed, in part, as 
alcohol abuse making DC 4<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no doubt the Applicant had a serious drinking problem as of April 19, 1999, the date of his last drink.  Since that time he has attended counseling, 
participated actively in AA for two years, and has remained sober.  He been sober for more than three years, which although not the distant past, is sufficient for 
me to find it is not recent and there is no indication of a recent problem.  Mitigating condition (MC) 2<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The LCSW last saw the Applicant in June 2002 and last talked with the Applicant in July 2002.  The counselor's substance abuse evaluation stated the 
Applicant has developed into a healthy, responsible, and mature individual, has accomplished all of the tasks expected to be completed to ensure long-term 
recovery from alcoholism, and has the support of family, friends, and co-workers. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From April 1999 through the Spring of 2001, the Applicant was very active in AA, attending meetings almost daily, attending the AA world convention, setting 
up AA banquets, and helping other AA groups to do likewise.  He is currently not attending meetings, but still has an AA sponsor whom he periodically talks 
with.  I do not think the Applicant's lack of current attendance in AA detracts from the fact that he lives his life according to the principles learned in AA.  He 
has taken what works in AA and successfully moved on with his life.  Additionally, the Applicant has others--family, friends, AA members, and 
counselor--who he can talk with should the need arise.  Through his involvement in AA, he is aware of the trigger that would lead to his return to drinking.  He 
knows that all that makes him happy will disappear if he takes another drink. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since April 1999, the Applicant has attended treatment, actively participated in AA, has a favorable prognosis, and has maintained his sobriety.  MC 4<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has changed his life style and understands the impact of having a single drink.  Should he chose to drink again, he understands this entire life 
would be ruined.  When he was drinking, he was completely miserable, sick, getting into fights and hurting people, not knowing what he had done the night 
before.  He has since turned his life around and now doing the right thing.  He is very happy with his life and job.  He spends his time exercising, reading, 
studying, taking university courses, enjoying the out doors, and no longer associates with his college buddies.  He has established a new way of life and has 
reformed from his past actions.  He now wakes with a clear head and strong understanding of what is important to him.  He loves his job and knows he is an 
alcoholic and knows the effect of having another drink, and does not want to return to his previous lifestyle.  He has no intention of drinking in the future.  
These are all indicative of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety and therefore MC 3<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because MC 2, 3, and 4 apply, I find for the Applicant as to SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a.,1.b.,1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 
and 1.n.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline J, (Criminal Conduct).  Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested seven times, four for the minor crimes of shoplifting and trespass, but also for the serious crimes of DUI, DWI, 
and indecent exposure.  Additionally, in April 1998, he failed to abide by the restrictions set forth in his suspended jail sentence which required him to stay out 
of certain convenience stores for this he was arrested in May 1998 and charged with criminal trespass.  The 1998 convenience store arrest also lead to a June 
1998 show cause summons in which he was found guilty of two counts of contempt, had to pay court costs and serve 44 days in jail.  DC a.<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and b.<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All of the Applicant's arrests occurred when the Applicant was either in high school or during his first three years of college. The Applicant's two most recent 
arrests both occurred in February 1999, more than three years ago.  Again, although not the distant past, it is sufficiently remote for MC a.<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> to apply.  As 
previously stated the Applicant has made a very remarkable change in his lifestyle.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He has established a new way of life and has reformed from his past 
actions.  He understands what is important to him, loves his job, and--acknowledging he is an alcoholic--know the effect should he resume drinking.  He does 
not want to return to his previous lifestyle and has no intention of drinking in the future.  He no longer goes to bars or clubs and no longer associates with his 
old drinking friends. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's counseling, AA involvement, change of life style, change of friends, and habits </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are all indicative of positive changes in 
behavior evidencing successful rehabilitation</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Therefore, MC f.<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, the arrests occurred when the Applicant was 15 to 21 years old.  Although the Applicant was age 21--when is was last arrested and when he last 
drank alcohol--is an age of maturity, however the age is not so advance as to say youth and immaturity did not play a role in his drinking.  I find for the 
Applicant as to SOR subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As subsequently explained, I find the Applicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts on his personnel security questionnaire.  
I find there was no violation of Title 18, United States Code &sect; 1001and find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 3.a . </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.   Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security 
clearance, or in other official matters is a security concern.  Thus, a falsification must be deliberate, and the falsified information must be material.  It is 
deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  An omission concerning an arrest is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently 
overlooked it, or misunderstood the question. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant answered Question 24 on his Std. Form 86 he listed his March 1997 shoplifting, his February 1998 shoplifting, and his February 1999 
DWI, but failed to list his 1993 shoplifting, his February 1998 DUI, which occurred in another state, and his February 1999 Mardi Gras arrest.  Although failing 
to list these three arrests,<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Applicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's heavy, daily drinking affected his memory to the point he suffered from "blackouts."  His blackouts and memory loss resulted in much of his 
past memories being lost and what remains is a blur.  He has no first-hand memory of portions of his past, but knows of past events only second hand from 
what others have told him.  The Applicant did not list his 1999 Mardi Gras arrest because he forgot about it until questioned by the DSS special agent.  After he 
was reminded of the event, he remembered he had been drinking, spent the night in the drunk tank, and was released the next day.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He has no independent 
memory of what occurred the previous night and relies only on what his friends have told him.  Although he repaid the amount of his bail, he does not believe 
he was charged or convicted of anything, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">never went before a judge, has never been contacted by the jurisdiction after he left the area.  Often the claim of a 
faulty memory is merely an excuse, but considering the factors related to his arrest and release and his blackouts, it is understandable this arrest might have 
slipped his mind.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant failed to list a shoplifting arrest when he was 15 years old believing it was outside the scope of the inquiry. While some of the questions on the 
Std. Form 86 restrict themselves to the prior 7 years or since age 16, Question 24 does not restrict the period of inquiry.  The question asks if the applicant has 
"ever" been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol.  Even though the question is all inclusive, the Applicant believed his shoplifting arrest 
at age 15 was beyond the scope of inquiry.  Even though the Applicant could not pin point where his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">misunderstanding originated--he though it might have 
come from what he had read before he completed the form, or from the software module when he completed the form, or something he was told by the Security 
Office--his explanation is accepted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant listed a 1999 DWI on his Std. Form 86, but failed to list his February 1998 DUI. When completing Question 24., the Applicant was under the 
incorrect impression he was to list only arrests which were part of his police record.  Even though the question is titled "Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug 
Offenses" it encompasses more than an individual's current police record for it asks if the individual had ever been arrested or convicted.  The Applicant had 
been arrested for the 1998 DUI, went to court, pleaded guilty to the DUI, and was told he was not on the docket.  Following his court date, he made numerous 
calls trying to get information concerning the DUI and was told there was no record of him in the system.  As he was completing the Std. Form 86, he asked his 
counselor to assist in having a check run of the Applicant's police record to assist him in completing the form. When the check failed to reveal his DUI, the 
Applicant was under the mistaken belief he did not have to list the arrest because of the lack of a record.  When later questioned about it he fully disclosed it in 
his first interview in August 2000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because acting under an erroneous belief, the Applicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts on his personnel security 
questionnaire. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant did not wilfully falsify his response to Question 24.  However, even if it was a willful falsification, MC 2<A HREF="01-20093.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> would apply since the 
falsification was an isolated incident being a response to a single question on a single questionnaire completed in February 2000, which is approximately two 
and a half years ago and therefore not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I find for the Applicant as to SOR 
subparagraph 3.a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
