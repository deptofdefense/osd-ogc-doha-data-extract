<P>Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, including a $34,000.00 child support arrearage.  He resolved most of the debts, including the child support.  
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and personal conduct.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  It alleges 10 
delinquent debts, including a $34,000.00 child support arrearage.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2003, admitted most of the debts, 
disputed the amount of child support arrearage, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case initially was assigned to another administrative judge,  and it was reassigned 
to me on September 23, 2004, based on workload considerations.  On the same day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for October 21, 2004.  
The case was heard as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 29, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a 39-year-old truck driver, and his current wife are owner-operators of an 18-wheeler truck and work for a defense contractor.  Applicant has a high

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was previously married in 1985, had two daughters, and was divorced in August 1990.  His ex-wife was given custody of the children.  Applicant 
was required to pay child support of $150.00 per month and was given visitation rights.  His ex-wife moved away and refused to let Applicant see or speak with 
his children.  When Applicant executed his security clearance application (SF 86) in November 2001, he listed his children's address as "unknown."  Applicant 
refused to pay the child support, hoping his action would trigger an intervention by the court and allow him to exercise his visitation rights.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In November 2003, Applicant's younger daughter, then 17 years old, began living with Applicant, because Applicant's ex-wife was suspected of being a drug 
addict.  In March 2004, Applicant's divorce decree was amended to give him custody of his daughter and terminate Applicant's child-support obligation.  
Applicant was advised by his lawyer that the court order relieved him of any obligation to pay the child support arrearage. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1997, several of Applicant's pay checks were returned for insufficient funds after being deposited in his checking account.  Applicant also had a signature 
loan at the same bank, and he fell about two months behind in his payments because of his worthless pay checks.  The bank recovered about $4,700.00 from 
Applicant's employer and covered the checks Applicant had written on his account.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The signature loan agreement had an acceleration clause that made the entire balance due within 10 days if Applicant missed a payment.  Applicant asked the 
bank to waive the acceleration clause because his late payments were caused by the worthless pay checks.  The local bank manager agreed, but the bank 
manager's superiors overruled him and demanded lump sum payment of the entire loan balance.  In December 2001, Applicant told a Defense Security Service 
(DSS) investigator, "Because of their treatment of me in this matter, which I had no control over, I have made no further payments to them."  (Government 
Exhibit 2, p. 4) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had a checking account with another bank, with arrangements to automatically debit his account to pay bills.  After Applicant withdrew his money 
and closed the account, the bank continued to automatically debit the account for several months, resulting in overdrafts of about $615.00. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At some time before October 1999, Applicant purchased a set of tires for his SUV that were defective.  Applicant and his wife had an accident when one of the 
new tires blew out.  The other three tires developed bulges.  The tire manufacturer was involved in a nation-wide recall after several rollover accidents were 
attributed to defective tires.  When the seller refused to replace the tires, Applicant refused to pay the account.  Applicant kept the defective tires for several 
years, hoping to reach a settlement, but to no avail.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In May 2002, Applicant was involved in a motorcycle accident.  He was hospitalized for three days and suffered a collapsed lung, but had no medical insurance.  
He negotiated a settlement with the hospital that included the radiology bills.  The hospital bill reflects that Applicant's account was charged to "charity" and 
has a zero balance.<A HREF="02-23011.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's lawyer has advised him that, under the law of the jurisdiction where the debts were incurred, legal action to collect a debt is barred after four years.  
The lawyer further advised Applicant not to pay the barred debts, because a voluntary payment would revive the debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's employer was purchased by a new owner in November 1997, and Applicant has had no further problems with worthless pay checks.  Applicant 
married his current wife in April 1998, and she has taken over the financial management of the trucking operation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">During the past five years, Applicant's financial situation has improved significantly.  He and his wife have a gross income of between $130,000.00 and 
$160,000.00 per year, and their net income after business expenses is about half that amount.  The payments on one 18-wheeler truck, his personal automobile, 
and a signature loan are current.  A second 18-wheeler truck is paid for and is leased by another trucker on a lease-purchase contract.  Applicant and his wife 
have about $5,200.00 in savings and have established a maintenance reserve fund of about $4,400.00 to cover any unexpected truck repairs.  Applicant's mobile 
home is fully paid for.  He does not have a credit card.  His current employer, friends, and associates regard him as a hard-working, honest, and dependable 
person.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through

Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline F could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 
applies where an applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> where an applicant has exhibited

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted several of the debts.  He also admitted he refused to pay off the signature loan when the bank would not compromise.  Thus, I conclude  DC

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing Applicant's behavior was not recent (MC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1.  MC 1 is not 
established by the fact that Applicant's delinquent debts are old, because his failure to pay them is a continuing course of conduct.  ISCR Case No. 01-3695, 
2002 DOHA LEXIS 453 at *7 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.3.4.  The record shows Applicant's initial delinquent payments on the signature loan were caused by his employer's conduct in issuing worthless pay 
checks.  His medical bills were the result of a motorcycle accident.  The child-support issue arose because Applicant's ex-wife refused to honor his visitation 
rights.  The overdraft was due to bank error.  I conclude MC 3 is established for these debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security concerns also may be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The concept of good faith "requires 
a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR Case No. 99-9020, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>supra</EM> at *5, 
quoting ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been able to resolve or compromise all the debts except the 
signature loan, the charge account involving defective tires, and the overdraft.  He attempted to settle the signature loan and charge account but was 
unsuccessful.  I conclude MC 6 is established for these two debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he intended to settle the $615.00 debt arising from the bank overdrafts, but he had not done so at the time of the 
hearing.  I am satisfied this unresolved debt, in the context of Applicant's overall financial situation and attempts to address his debts, does not raise significant 
security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under the law of the jurisdiction where the debts were incurred, a debt is legally unenforceable if the creditor does not bring suit within four years after the case 
of action accrues.  Two of Applicant's unresolved debts, the signature loan and the charge account, appear to be legally unenforceable under this statute of 
limitations.  In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the signature loan soon will be deleted from Applicant's credit history.<A HREF="02-23011.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The legal bar to 
enforcement does not mitigate DC 1 and DC 3.  In this regard, it is similar to a discharge in bankruptcy.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-9020, 2001 WL 1044524 at *9 
n. 12 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).  However, it is relevant because it reduces Applicant's vulnerability to coercion and temptation to engage in illegal conduct to 
generate funds.  Because these debts are not legally enforceable, Applicant is not financially overextended or vulnerable to coercion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge is not limited to mitigating conditions listed in adjudicative guidelines when deciding whether an applicant has demonstrated 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances.  ISCR Case No. 99-0452 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2000).  Applicant's financial situation has changed 
dramatically over the past five years.  He is financially secure and gainfully employed.  He has received legal advice about his financial obligations and has 
been judicially relieved of his child support obligation, including the arrearage.  He has demonstrated honesty and good faith.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision "must be an overall common sense determination."  Directive &para; E2.2.3.  Applicant is unable to pay off the signature loan in one 
lump sum, as demanded by the bank.  Now that legal action to collect the loan is barred by law, it makes no fiscal sense for Applicant to obtain another loan to 
pay off the signature loan.  "[A] security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant's personal debts."  Instead, it is focused on 
"evaluation of an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness."  ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  After weighing all the 
applicable disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, applying the whole-person concept, and using a common-sense approach, I am satisfied the 
security concerns raised by Applicant's financial history are mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Security concerns can be raised by personal conduct that 
makes an applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress (DC 4), or by a pattern of rule violations (DC 5).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A5.1.2.4., E2.A5.1.2.5.  
Applicant's child support arrearage and violation of the court decree ordering him to pay child support establish DC 4 and DC 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The court order relieving Applicant of any liability for child support is a mitigating condition because it removed his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.5.  His disobedience of the court decree requiring child support payments did not reflect contempt for the court, but rather was an 
unsophisticated effort to force court action and protect his visitation rights.  He eventually prevailed by obtaining a modification of the court order and 
forgiveness of the arrearage.  Any security concerns based on child support arrearage under Guideline E are mitigated.</SPAN></P>
