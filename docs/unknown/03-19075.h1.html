<P>Applicant was involved in three incidents involving classified materials: (1) she forgot to secure her safe on one occasion; (2) she inadvertently moved 
classified material to an unclassified computer because a colleague failed to identify the material as classified; and (3) she failed to double-check a colleague's 
safe at the end of the day, as required by local security procedures.  Security concerns under Guidelines K and E are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On June 24, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to revoke 
Applicant's security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines K (Security Violations) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 21, 2004.  She admitted the specific allegations in the SOR, denied that her conduct raised security concerns, 
offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on August 31, 2004.  On September 1, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of hearing 
setting the case for October 7, 2004.  I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 26, 2004.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 42-year-old computer software engineer.  She is employed as a principal engineer manager for a defense contractor.  She has worked for her 
present employer for ten years.  She has worked as a computer software engineer for more than 20 years.  She has a bachelor of science degree in electrical and 
computer engineering, a master's degree in electrical engineering, and a master's degree in systems engineering.  She has held a security clearance for five 
years.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a single parent and adoptive mother of a 14-year-old boy.  She also has a 3-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl.  She is very active in community 
affairs and holds positions of trust in civic organizations.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's work site consists of a classified laboratory and an unclassified laboratory.  About ten to fifteen employees work in the classified laboratory.  There 
are four safes and 20-25 computers in the classified area, which is protected by a dial lock, number lock, and an electronic alarm system.</P> 
 
<P>On June 27, 2002, Applicant opened a safe in a classified laboratory and forgot to lock it when she left the laboratory for lunch.  She locked the laboratory when 
she left.  A security specialist conducting a spot check noticed the unlocked safe.  The security specialist secured the safe and determined that no classified 
information was compromised.  Although Applicant had a security clearance for about three years before this incident, this was her first classified project, and 
she was not yet accustomed to the security routine.  Her supervisor discussed the incident with her, and he described her reaction as "very embarrassed."  She 
accepted responsibility and promised that it would not happen again.  No formal action was taken against her.  This incident is the basis for the SOR &para; 1.c.</P> 
 
<P>On August 16, 2002, Applicant was asked by a colleague to move four files, believed to be unclassified, from a classified computer to an unclassified computer.  
At the time, the laboratory was working on a cell phone that could be used for unclassified conversations and encrypted for classified conversations.  The 
operational "keys" for enabling and disabling encryption were classified.  Unclassified keys were also produced to allow integration of internal components and 
testing of the equipment in an unclassified environment.  Because the four files were located in the same location as other unclassified test keys, Applicant 
initially believed they were unclassified, and she moved three of them to the unclassified computer.  She became uncertain about the fourth file because of its 
subject matter and did not move it.  Instead, she sent an e-mail to a more knowledgeable engineer asking about the fourth file.  At the end of the work day, 
while in the parking lot on the way home, Applicant learned from her more knowledgeable colleague that the three files she had moved were classified.  The 
laboratory had adopted a convention for identifying classified files by adding the letter "s" to the file name, which is a string of numbers, but the engineer who 
created the classified files neglected to insert an "s" in the file name.  Applicant immediately returned to her work area, shut down the unclassified computer, 
carried it into the secure laboratory, placed a classified marker on it, and reported the incident to the security office.  A security specialist verified that no back-up of the unclassified computer had been made after classified files had been moved to it.  No classified information was compromised, and no formal action 
was taken against Applicant.  This incident was the basis for the SOR &para; 1.b.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a reputation for being proactive in developing preventive security measures.  She was a coauthor of the security plan for the laboratory.  After the 
August 2002 security incident, Applicant suggested to her security office that the laboratory adopt additional security measures, including a double-check 
procedure that would require the last person to leave the laboratory to make a comprehensive security check before leaving.  The procedure includes checking 
all safes in the laboratory to make sure they properly locked.  This procedure is followed whenever the last person leaves the laboratory during the work day or 
at the end of the day.  The only difference between a midday check and an end-of-day check is that the electronic alarm is not activated midday.  The security 
office adopted Applicant's suggestion.  </P> 
 
<P>On March 17, 2003, Applicant was the last person to leave the classified laboratory at the end of the day.  Earlier in the day, a colleague had closed a safe, 
changed the magnetic sign to reflect that it was closed, and signed the security sheet on the safe.  However, he neglected to spin the dial of the lock, thereby 
leaving the safe unlocked.  As required by the procedure she had suggested and the laboratory had adopted, Applicant checked each safe.  All were closed, the 
outside signs read "closed," and all security sheets were signed.  Applicant did not pull on the drawer, however, which would have revealed that it was not 
locked.  She secured the laboratory door as she left.  A short time later a security specialist made a spot check and discovered the unlocked safe.  The specialist 
security secured the safe.  No classified information was compromised.  This incident was the basis for the SOR &para; 1.a.  The decision to revoke Applicant's 
security clearance was prompted by this incident but based on all three incidents.</P> 
 
<P>After the March 2003 incident, Appellant held a brainstorming session with computer and security personnel to find ways to minimize the chances of a 
recurrence.  As a result of that meeting, several additional security measures were adopted, including reducing the number of classified computers, arranging 
safes in more visible positions, and using visible markers on equipment containing an encryption card.  At the hearing Applicant was asked why she convened 
this meeting, and she responded, "It made sense. . . .  I just wanted to make it less likely that violations would occur again in the future, whether it was me or 
someone else."</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has handled and safeguarded classified materials "thousands" of times.  The senior security manager for Applicant's employer regards Applicant as 
reliable, trustworthy, and very security conscious.  The security specialist who investigated and reported all three incidents testified at the hearing and described 
Applicant as conscientious, dedicated, and trustworthy.  Both the senior security manager and the security specialist have supported Applicant's efforts to retain 
her security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant enjoys a reputation among her colleagues as a person of great dedication, honesty, and integrity, who is willing to take responsibility for her own 
actions.  The three incidents were considered by her colleagues and supervisors as out of character.  Her supervisors give her high marks for technical skill, 
organizational ability, leadership, dedication, and attention to detail.  She is known as a "hands on" manager and an excellent mentor for less experienced 
software engineers.  She has received numerous awards for superior performance.  Her performance appraisal for the period following the last security incident 
recites, "we need a lot of Kellys."</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has continued to handle a high volume of classified material since the last incident.  At the time of the hearing, 19 months had elapsed without any 
security violations.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify,

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline K, "[n]oncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard 
classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A1.1.1.  The applicable disqualifying condition in this case is DC 2: "Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to 
negligence."  Directive &para; E2A11.1.2.2.  </P> 
 
<P>There is no evidence that any of the three incidents were deliberate, but the incidents of June 2002 (forgetting to lock the safe) and March 2003 (neglecting to 
double-check a colleague's safe) were negligent.  Because there was more than one incident, they are "multiple."  <EM>See</EM> <EM>The American Heritage Dictionary of the 
English Language </EM>(4<SUP>th</SUP> Ed. 2000) (defining "multiple" as "having, relating to, or consisting of more than one individual, element, part, or other component").  I 
conclude DC 2 is established.</P> 
 
<P>The incident of August 2002 (moving a classified file onto an unclassified computer) happened in spite of Applicant's careful efforts to move only unclassified 
files onto the computer.  The incident happened because a colleague did not follow the convention of identifying classified files by adding the letter "s" to the 
string of numbers in the file name.  Applicant discovered the problem when she consulted with a more experienced colleague.  She immediately took steps to 
avoid compromising the material and self-reported the incident to her security specialist.  I conclude that Applicant's conduct in this incident was not negligent.  </P> 
 
<P>A mitigating condition (MC 1) applies if the conduct was inadvertent.  Directive &para; E2.A1.1.3.1.  The unauthorized transfer of classified files to an unclassified 
computer despite Applicant's efforts to protect classified materials was inadvertent.  I conclude MC 1 is established  and the security concerns arising from the 
second incident (SOR &para; 1.b.) are mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>MC 2 applies if the security violations were "isolated or infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A11.1.3.2.  The first two violations occurred within two months of each 
other.  All three violations occurred within a nine-month period.  Under the circumstances, they were not "isolated or infrequent."  I conclude MC 2 is not 
established.</P> 
 
<P>MC 4 applies if an applicant has demonstrated "a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities."  Directive &para; E2.A11.1.3.4. Applicant's 
attitude toward her security responsibilities has been "positive" for as long as she has worked with classified materials.  She coauthored the laboratory's security 
procedures.  After her first incident when she failed to lock her safe, she was embarrassed and determined not to let it happen again.  She has not had a personal 
security violation since March 2003. </P> 
 
<P>After the second incident when she inadvertently moved a classified file onto an unclassified computer, she self-reported and took immediate action to avoid a 
compromise of the material.  Her testimony at the hearing was notable in that she carefully avoided blaming the colleague who neglected to properly mark the 
classified files.  Instead, she accepted responsibility for not being even more careful than she had been.  After the second incident, she proactively suggested 
additional security precautions, including the double-check procedure that she violated in the third incident.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant used the third incident as an opportunity to again review the laboratory's security procedures.  As with the second incident, she accepted 
responsibility, did not attempt to shift blame,  and used the incident as a learning experience and a catalyst for improving security procedures.</P> 
 
<P>Ironically, Applicant was a victim of her own proactive approach to security.  The laboratory's security specialist testified that if Applicant had not suggested 
the double-check procedure, it would not have been adopted, and Applicant would not have been accused of the third security violation that triggered the action 
to revoke her clearance.  </P> 
 
<P>The three incidents were qualitatively different and occurred during a nine-month period shortly after Applicant started working on classified projects.  At the 
time, Applicant was an experienced engineer and manager but a neophyte in security procedures.  The first incident (failing to secure her safe) was a personal 
dereliction that occurred on her first classified project, before she was accustomed to the security routine.  The second (moving classified files onto an 
unclassified computer) was an inadvertent violation caused by a colleague's failure to adhere to the security procedure for identifying classified files.  The third 
(failing to double-check a colleague's safe) occurred in a supervisory capacity.  At the time of the hearing, nineteen months had elapsed since her last security 
violation.</P> 
 
<P>The record amply reflects that Applicant has demonstrated a positive attitude toward security.  She clearly understands that the trial-and-error approach 
common in software research and development, where she spent most of her career, is not acceptable in a classified environment.  She has accepted 
responsibility for her mistakes and those of her colleagues and used them as a catalyst for improving security procedures.  I conclude that MC 4 is established.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a distinguished 20-year record.  She is highly respected as a software engineer, mentor, supervisor, and civic-minded citizen.  She has been 
aggressive in improving security procedures for her laboratory.   She has handled classified materials properly thousands of times.  Both the senior security 
officer for her employer and the security specialist for her laboratory regard her as very reliable and trustworthy, and they supported her at the hearing, one by 
personal testimony and one by a written recommendation.  </P> 
 
<P>The "whole person" concept set out in the Directive &para; E2.2.3. contemplates that we  evaluate applicants by the totality of their acts and omissions.  After 
considering all the evidence of record, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating conditions, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concern raised by her security violations.  The allegations under Guideline K are resolved for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise from "[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations."  The conduct alleged under Guideline E is the same conduct alleged under Guideline K, discussed 
above.  The relevant disqualifying conditions under Guideline E are DC 1 (reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, and coworkers) 
and DC 5 (pattern of rule violations).  </P> 
 
<P>The unfavorable information in this case came from the employer's security specialist and from Applicant.  I conclude that DC 1 is established.  </P> 
 
<P>The first violation by leaving the safe unlocked and the third violation by failing to double-check a colleague's safe violated security rules.  The second 
violation by moving the classified files to an unclassified computer was inadvertent and not Applicant's fault.  Applicant violated no rules in the second 
incident.  The first and third violations occurred nine months apart, and more than 19 months have passed without further violations.  I conclude that the two 
rule violations do not constitute a pattern.  Thus, I conclude that DC 5 is not established.</P> 
 
<P>The fundamental question is whether Applicant's past conduct justifies confidence that she can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  While 
Applicant's security violations cannot be condoned, her overall attitude and performance clearly establish she can be trusted to properly safeguard classified 
information.  None of the enumerated mitigating conditions under Guideline E are applicable.  However, the mitigating conditions under Guideline K are 
relevant, applicable to Applicant's conduct, and established by the evidence discussed above for Guideline K.  Based on the entire record, I conclude the 
security concern raised by Applicant's personal conduct is mitigated.</P>
