<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On August 26, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> issued a Statement Reasons
(SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The
SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him access to classified information and recommends that his case be submitted to an
Administrative Judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	On October 2, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 2, 2004
and the hearing was scheduled for May 7, 2004.  For good cause shown, the hearing was postponed
and held on June 16, 2004.  During the hearing, two Government exhibits (Govt Ex), four Applicant
exhibits (Ap Ex), and the testimony of one Government witness and three Applicant witnesses,
including Applicant, were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on June 29, 2004.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of
fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is a 62-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor.  He is seeking
a security clearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was a systems analyst with his previous employer.  In June 1998, he was the
technical lead for software development on a company project at a federal department.  Frequently,
Applicant became upset and yelled at other members of his team.  On June 10, he met with his
supervisor and three of the team members to discuss the situation and try to resolve it.  Later that
same day, Applicant met with his supervisor.  His supervisor informed Applicant that he was
removing him from the project and having him assigned to another project.  The next day, Applicant
was removed from the project.  Two days later, he was placed on administrative and/or sick leave
and advised to seek medical assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant consulted with his primary care provider, who prescribed Paxil and referred
Applicant to a psychiatrist.  His psychiatrist determined that Applicant's condition was the result of
moderate depression, lack of adequate sleep, and the pressures of his job.  He prescribed Zyprexia
in additional to Paxil.  Applicant continues to take both medications on a daily basis and consults 
his psychiatrist on a regular basis.  Since undergoing treatment, he has not engaged in the type of
behavior that lead to his removal from the project.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	On August 12, 1998, Applicant returned to work for his former employer on another project
at the same federal department where he had worked on his previous project.  The government
manager had requested that Applicant be assigned to the project. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	That same month, Applicant notified his employer that he would be leaving the company to
accept his position with his current employer.  His previous employer accepted his resignation but
permitted him to continue to work on the project through September 30.  Applicant joined his current
employer on October 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	On May 23, 2000, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86).  In response
to initial part of question 19,<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> he answered, "yes," and provided the name and address of his
psychiatrist and another therapist.  In response to the second part of question 19,<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant
answered, "no."  In response to question 20,<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant answered, "no" (SOR ¶ 1.a).  In addition,
Applicant signed the authorization for release of medical information included with the SF 86.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	During the course of investigating Applicant, a special agent for the Defense Security Service
(DSS) obtained information concerning the events in June 1998. On April 18, 2001, he interviewed
Applicant and confronted him with those events.  Applicant provided a sworn statement in which
he related the circumstances that lead to leaving his previous employer.  After being informed by the
special agent that he should have provided that information in response to question 20 on his SF 86,
Applicant also acknowledged that he should have done so.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is currently assigned by his employer as the project manager for the same project
on which he worked for his last employer.  Applicant's character and work performance for the
company for which he works are highly regarded by both the company president and the vice
president to whom Applicant directly reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive E3.1.14.  The applicant is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting
adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An evaluation of whether an
applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the
"whole person concept."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should
include the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor
of national security.  Directive E2.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could
raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a concern
and support granting a clearance.  The following guideline is applicable to this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E: Personal Conduct</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The concern under Guideline E is conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. 
Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E include
E2.A5.1.2.2 (Disqualifying Condition 2).  Disqualifying Condition 2 covers the deliberate omission,
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment,
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,
or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The Government alleges Applicant falsified material facts in response to question 20 of his
SF 86 by not disclosing his removal from a project by his former employer.  Question 20 requires
an applicant to disclose any of the following events within last 10 years: "fired from a job; quit a job
after being told you'd be fired; left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct;
left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance; left a job for
other reason under unfavorable circumstances."  The key term is "job."       </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant testified he did not provide the information in response to question 20 because he
interpreted the use of "job" as synonymous with employer.  Because none of conditions related to
his overall employment, he answered, "no."  Although contending that Applicant should have
disclosed the information in response to question 20, the Government does not appear to be arguing
a different interpretation of "job."  In fact , when asked if he interpreted the word "job" in question
20 to mean specific projects assigned by an employer, the DSS special agent answered: "No.  I
referred to it as the employer, the job meaning employer."<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Actually, "job" is susceptible to being interpreted with either meaning.  It can refer to a "task"
or "a regular remunerative position."<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  However, it appears more likely to associate the term with
one's overall employment rather than a particular project or assignment.  Under the circumstances, 
Applicant's interpretation of the term in responding to question 20 is reasonable.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Department Counsel argues Applicant should have disclosed this information before being
confronted with it by the special agent.  But that is not what the SOR alleges nor does the record 
establish that Applicant lied to the investigator.  The fact the special agent's investigation revealed
this information, which is pertinent to a determination of Applicant's fitness for a security clearance,
does not ipso facto establish that Applicant acted improperly by not disclosing it in response to
question 20.  Moreover, Applicant did disclose information on his SF 86 pertaining to the events in
1998.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's response to question 19 on the same SF 86 demonstrates that he was not trying
to conceal the information.  He admitted he had consulted mental health professionals and provided
the name and address of the psychiatrist who has treated him since the events in June 1998 as well
as that of another therapist involved in the same treatment.  He further indicated the consultation
went beyond marital, family, or grief counseling.<A HREF="02-24065.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant also executed the release that would
enable the Government to obtain information from the these mental health professionals concerning
his condition and treatment.  The DSS special agent, who investigate Applicant, confirmed that
Applicant's response to question 19 would result in DSS pursuing medical interviews.  Based on
Applicant's response to question 19 and his medical release, he would have reasonably expected the
Government to obtain information pertaining to the events in 1998.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The record fails to establish that Applicant falsified material facts on SF 86.  In addition, it
does not raise any other security concern because the evidence establishes that Applicant's treatment
and medication have eliminated the behavior that caused his previous employer to remove him from
a project.  I find in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P>
