<P>Applicant has a chronic shopping problem.  She spent thousands of dollars shopping, and embezzled $241,000 from her former employer to pay for the items 
she purchased.  She made restitution and was fired.  On the current federal charges, the Federal District Court convicted her of wire fraud and sentenced her to a 
year and a day in prison.  Previously she was arrested for shoplifting a comparatively minor amount, and was convicted of a misdemeanor.    Applicant has not 
mitigated the criminal conduct or financial considerations disqualifying conditions.  Serious questions remain about her ability to conform to security clearance 
restrictions.  Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
 
<P>On February 13, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under the personnel security Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated March 7, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  She requested a hearing.  This case was reassigned to me 
from another administrative judge on April 2, 2003 due to caseload considerations.  On April 15, 2003 a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing date 
for May 9, 2003.  On that date I convened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security 
clearance.  The Government presented nine exhibits, all of which were admitted into evidence. Applicant appeared and testified, and offered 20 exhibits<A HREF="02-15680.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>, all of 
which were admitted into evidence.  Applicant testified and presented three witnesses.  Applicant was given two weeks until May 23,  2003 to submit a 
statement from a priest friend of hers.  She did submit that document on time.  I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 20, 2003.  </P> 
 
<P>In the meantime, the Federal Court of Appeals, on an appeal of Applicant's sentence by the U.S. Attorney, reversed and remanded the District Court's sentence.  
Upon re-sentencing, Applicant received a year and a day in prison, thereby making her subject to the provisions of the Smith Act (10 U.S.C. 986).  To allow her 
the opportunity to present evidence on that issue which was not addressed at the first hearing on May 9<SUP>th</SUP>, I reconvened the hearing on July 3, 2003.  The 
Government presented another exhibit, which was numbered "10."  Applicant appeared and presented additional evidence, however she did not have an official 
transcript of the District Court's new sentence.  She was given two weeks additional time to obtain that official transcript, which was to be Exhibit Y.  
Applicant was not able to obtain the transcript by August 25, 2003, and the record is, therefore, closed.  I note also that Applicant has appealed the new 
sentence of incarceration imposed by the U.S. District Court.</P> 
 
<P>At this hearing the Government moved to amend Paragraph 1.c. to strike the last sentence of that paragraph and substitute therefor the following wording: "The 
7<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the May 23, 2001 sentence and at a re-sentencing before the U.S. District Court judge on June 6, 2003, 
Applicant was sentenced to a year and a day in the federal penitentiary.  Applicant will appeal this sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals."  Applicant also 
moved to change the amount of the fine stated in this paragraph from $30,000 to $10,000 to reflect the modification ordered by the federal district judge.  
Without objection by the Government or Applicant these amendments were adopted. (Tr. 4 to 7)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. (in part), 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. of the SOR.  She disagreed with the arrest allegation in subparagraph 
2.c. and the restitution allegation in subparagraph 2.b.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of 
the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49 year old and married for 17 years with no children.  Applicant is a consultant, with a business title description as an "organizational change 
architect" working in a logistics modernization unit for a major defense contractor.  She has a master's degree in human resources. (Tr. 89, 133-134, 146-153; 
Exhibits B and U)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's financial problems arose due to her extravagant spending habits, which were not motivated by any need for the acquired items, but as a pleasurable 
means to relieve her depression.  She did not disclose the high credit card bills to her husband because she feared he would leave her.  Applicant has suffered 
from depression since college and sought counseling after her graduation.  From 1993 to 1996 she was treated by a medical professional in her former state and 
town of residence.  That professional prescribed Zoloft at 150 mg. and later tapered that off and prescribed Prozac 80 mg. (Tr. 130, 137, 139; Exhibits 2 at 3, 9 
at 1 to 13) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant moved to her current city of residence in November, 1996.  Her job produced stress and her depression worsened.  Her husband persuaded her to 
return to therapy in September, 1998.  She started to see a psychiatrist who specialized in compulsive shopping disorders, and consult with another physician 
who prescribed medications for her.  She is currently taking Prozac at 60 mg., Wellbutron at 400 mg., and Lamictol.  She feels better and is functioning better, 
and thinks she is doing better after hitting rock bottom several years ago. She is currently in therapy. (Tr. 96-99, 137, 141, Exhibits 8, C, D, and F)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had two incidents of shoplifting when she lived in her originating state.  No criminal action was taken against her on those two incidents.  She 
returned the merchandise from one incident, and the second store forgave her the small item she took because she shopped there all the time. (Tr. 29-30, 114; 
Exhibit 9 at 6)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant shoplifted clothing from a department store in her current city of residence in February, 1999, and was arrested and prosecuted in state court.  The 
charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.  She was given two years probation, had to pay $600 in fees, and was not ordered to pay any restitution or fine.  She 
successfully completed her probation in 2001. (Exhibits 2 at 3, 3, 4; Exhibit G; Tr. 110, 112).</P> 
 
<P>In 2001, Applicant was charged with wire fraud for obtaining travel money from her employer, a former prominent accounting firm which no longer exists.  She 
was not arrested at any time, and certainly not at her work place, as was alleged.  She would complete travel vouchers and obtain payment for trips she did not 
take, and similar items.  She took the money to pay for credit card debt incurred from her shopping for jewelry and clothing.  Her charges totaled over $200,000 
over several years.  She extracted these sums from her employer unlawfully over a three year period.  She pled guilty in Federal District Court and was 
sentenced to five years probation, a fine of $30,000, to pay restitution of $241,061.08 to her former employer, and prohibited from having any credit cards 
without court permission.   Pursuant to the Court order, she repaid that money by taking out a second mortgage on their condo residence and from family 
savings and loans.  The mortgage is $430,000 on a condo with a fair market value of $500,000.  There is no practical equity against which Applicant could 
borrow further on that property.  Applicant was fired from her job, and later rehired by a previous employer. (Response at 3 and 4; Tr. 82-83, 117, 126, 136, 
154; Exhibits 2 at 1, 2, 4, 5 - 7; Exhibit Y at 4, 5, 11)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's sentence was appealed by the United States Attorney and reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals.  The downward departure sentence ordered by the 
U.S. District Court judge was not allowed.  Applicant was re-sentenced on June 6, 2003, to a prison sentence of a year and a day in jail (which sentence was 
suggested by her counsel at the re-sentencing hearing), and a fine of $10,000 instead of the $30,000 originally ordered and paid by Applicant.  Applicant was 
also sentenced to two years of supervised release, including needing court permission to obtain credit cards or enter into new credit relationships without court 
permission, and she is required to maintain mental health treatment.  Applicant is appealing that sentence.  The federal sentencing guidelines make the range of 
incarceration allowed to be 12 to 18 months. (Second Tr. 5-7, 20-22; Exhibit X, Y at 8 and 12, 24 to 26; Exhibit 12)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's household income is sufficient to leave a monthly surplus of income over expenses of $4,500.  Their annual income is about $250,000.  She and her 
husband are paying their credit card debts responsibly monthly.  However, their household debt increased to pay the restitution and fines, and the credit card 
debt exceeds $30,000. (Tr. 82 to 87, 119; Exhibit T) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is well-regarded for her professional work product and ethics.  She has many friends and colleagues who provided good character references. 
(Exhibits A, B, J, K, M to S, U to W, Z; Tr. 40 - 45, 52 to 69)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  </P> 
 
<P>(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable               participation; </P> 
 
<P>(3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; </P> 
 
<P>(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(5) the voluntariness of participation; </P> 
 
<P>(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;</P> 
 
<P>(7) the motivation for the conduct; </P> 
 
<P>(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and </P> 
 
<P>(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive,&sect; E2.2.1., Enclosure 2).</P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<P><STRONG>Smith Amendment</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2001. </EM> The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of that Act.  The amendment was added to Title 10, United States Code, adding a news section (10 U.S.C.&para; 986) that precludes 
the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific circumstances.  The situation described in this case involves 
one of those specific circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>The statutory mandate applies to any employee of a DoD contractor, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to 
classified information and who has been convicted in any court of the United States or a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, 
regardless of the time actually served.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An overall point to be remembered in this case is that no one disputes the sequence of events which occurred in Applicant's life.  She admitted her compulsive 
shopping problem and its root cause in her depression.  She admitted her medical care and therapy attempting to address the problem.  The only aspect of this 
case Applicant argues is the applicability of mitigating factors so she can obtain a security clearance.  She seeks also to avoid the strictures of the Smith 
Amendment by demonstrating her good character, professional work, and responsible treatment and control of her depression and shopping behavior.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government proved Applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  There are three incidents of shoplifting, the first two resulted in no criminal charges, and the 
last one resulted in a misdemeanor conviction in a state court with a sentence of probation and court fees.  Applicant also was convicted in federal court of a 
felony on her plea to extract about $241,000 from her employer by wire fraud.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 2 apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Mitigating Conditions (MC) that Applicant wants applied are all but one (acquittal).  However, these crimes were recent and the punishment is as of yet 
unfulfilled because of the appeals, first by the government and now by Applicant.  Each fraudulent travel voucher signed and submitted, each unlawful payment 
received and spent on Applicant's personal clothing and jewelry expenses, is a separate offense.  These offenses continued over three years.  The amount taken 
unlawfully is very large.  Therefore, the crimes are not isolated.  The wire fraud and the shoplifting are part of a pattern of misconduct by Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Next, Applicant would have us accede to her theory that her depression caused her to shop, and then steal and commit wire fraud.  Therefore, she was coerced, 
but now her therapy has rehabilitated her.  The evidence shows she has been in therapy since 1977  in at least three major blocks of time.  She is also on 
medication to alleviate her depression.  If she leaves therapy, which she has done in the past because she did not find a therapist compatible or she moved for 
job reasons, and/or she stops taking her medications, then she is at risk again.  Her depression is a life-time struggle.  The government has no control over her 
voluntary choices in treatment, and if she were to lapse, engage in shopping, accumulate large bills, and have classified information to sell, the government 
would be at risk then.  Furthermore, I conclude she voluntarily committed her crimes.  Excessive shopping is one condition, stealing and wire fraud are planned 
activities involving a person's cognitive functions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant strongly advocated her position that she has been successfully rehabilitated.  However, she continues in therapy, which in view of her history 
and the history of family depression is appropriate, and Applicant takes at least two and possibly three prescribed medications to alleviate her depression, which 
causes in some part her excessive shopping.  I cannot conclude based on the letter exhibits Applicant submitted from her physicians that she has been 
successfully rehabilitated.  Her physicians did not testify at the hearing and submit themselves to cross-examination.  Applicant may be on the road to recovery 
and control of her problems, but she does not seem to have arrived yet, certainly the evidence does not support that conclusion.  In fact, her physician states in 
two exhibits (8 and F) that continued treatment is necessary to maintain a good prognosis.  Yet her husband testified he thinks Applicant is better and could do 
without therapy if her physician retired. (Tr. 105)  That view is not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Therefore, I conclude no mitigating factors are applicable.  I am strengthened in this conclusion by the analysis presented by the U.S. Court of Appeals in its 
decision reversing the first sentence imposed by the U.S. District Court after Applicant's wire fraud conviction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government proved Applicant had financial problems.  She had very high credit card debt, and her husband's statements about their finances show he, who 
now controls those finances, constantly seeks lower interest rates on credit card debt to lessen those costs on the large balances resulting from Applicant's prior 
shopping excesses.  Coupled with the large increase in the mortgage balance on their condo, incurred to pay the restitution ordered by the Federal Court, this 
debt load clearly places Applicant within this Guideline.  Expense account fraud is a specific condition in the Guideline F.  It is clear from the testimony that 
Applicant's high household income is not sufficient to allow these debts to be repaid to any reasonable level within the next several years.  The debts are just 
too high.  These financial conditions are linked to an issue of security concern, which is Applicant's chronic depression and shopping excesses.  "Compulsive 
behavior that affects one's financial condition, work performance or relationships with others often prompts denial of security clearance because of the 
intractable nature of the underlying problem.  Behavior that is out of control can compromise an employee's dependability."<A HREF="02-15680.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 
1, 2, 3, and 5 apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The next issue is whether Applicant mitigated these conditions.  I apply the same analysis to these mitigating conditions as I did for the Guideline J mitigating 
factors.  The only one which might be applicable is MC 6.  However, the debts were taken upon her husband and herself.  They remain unpaid in that sense.  
Applicant and her husband are repaying their debts in an orderly fashion.  But Applicant's mitigating evidence is insufficient to overcome the weight of the DC 
cited in the previous paragraph.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government, predicated upon trust and confidence. The 
Government must trust that the person will act accordingly with regard to Government classified information at all times, on and off duty.  The Government 
must have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons to whom it gives access to classified information.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information. 
Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of 
persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 
531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubts will be 
resolved in favor of the national security, and access to classified information will be denied. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Such is the case here.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was advised of the possible applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (Smith Amendment) at the first hearing on May 9, 2003, prior to her re-sentencing.  
After the re-sentencing, a continuation of the hearing was conducted on July 3, 2003, to afford Applicant the opportunity to present evidence on the 
applicability of the Smith Amendment.  She did make such a presentation, and that evidence has been considered.  I find the Smith Amendment is applicable 
because she was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, making condition one directly applicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regardless of the analysis under the Guidelines J and F, which would not grant her a security clearance, the Smith Amendment, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, precludes the 
granting or renewal of a security clearance to those applicants for access who have been convicted in any Federal or State court and sentenced to more than one 
year, regardless of the time actually served.  Applicant stands convicted of a Federal offense, and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.  Therefore, she 
falls within the purview of the Smith Amendment.  She is ineligible for a clearance without a waiver.  Applicant's criminal conduct and financial considerations 
provide sufficient bases for denial of her clearance, independent of this statutory disqualification. </SPAN></P>
