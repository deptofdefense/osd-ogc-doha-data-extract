<P>Applicant is married to a woman from Kazakhstan who has relatives living in Russia.  Two of Applicant's three brothers are married to Russian women, at least

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 15 October 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-16657.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 10 November 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 27 January 
2004.  On 2 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 17 March 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old compliance officer for a defense contractor who traces his ancestry in the U.S. back to 1636.  He ensures the company is in 
compliance with all laws and regulations governing the transfer of technology and materials to foreign countries, including Japan and the countries that were 
formerly part of the Soviet Union.  Ex. 1 at 1, 2; Ex. T; Tr. 27-28, 64-65.  Applicant received his security clearance in 1987.  Ex. 1 at 8.  Applicant has the 
respect of his colleagues and friends as a hardworking patriot who has demonstrated sound judgment and strength of character.  Exs. A-N.</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant was in kindergarten, one of his classmates was from Japan.  Although Applicant has only seen his classmate once since kindergarten, they still 
exchange holiday greetings each year.  The Japanese friend is now a permanent U.S. resident.  Tr. 60.</P> 
 
<P>In 1990 or 1991, Applicant's brother R married a Russian woman who was studying in the U.S.  Ex. 2 at 2.  She is now a U.S. citizen and her family members 
are permanent U.S. residents.  She arranged meetings for Applicant with Russian woman in the local area.  Nothing came of these meetings and Applicant 
decided to find a wife on his own.  Applicant found his wife through a magazine advertisement for Russian women interested in marrying American men.  
Applicant's wife was born in the Soviet Union, in Kyrgyzstan, but she lived in Kazakhstan before coming to the U.S.  Tr. 67.  Applicant traveled to St. 
Petersburg, Russia, in 1994 to meet her.  After 10-12 days, they traveled to Kazakhstan so he could meet her family.  Tr. 89.  She came to the U.S. in the Spring 
of 1995 on a fianc&eacute;e visa and they were married in August 1995.  Ex. 3 at 2.  She became U.S. citizen in 2001.  Tr. 60.  The couple have two children.  Tr. 77.  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a "preference that the specific manner of [his] meeting [his] wife not be common knowledge amongst [his] colleagues at work, on a no need to 
know basis."  Ex. P at 6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's brother K is also married to a Russian woman.  Ex. 3 at 2.  His wife's father is a colonel (equivalent) in a Russian paratroop regiment.  Ex. 4 at 2; 
Tr. 104.  Applicant met K's wife's family in Russia during a business trip several years ago.  None of the family spoke English.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife's parents are citizens of Kazakhstan, and now permanent U.S. residents.  Tr. 60, 70.  When they came to the U.S., they lived with Applicant 
and his wife, but have since found a place of their own.  Applicant provides living/financial assistance to them.  Ex. 4 at 4.  Applicant's wife's brother was a 
citizen of Kazakhstan, was married, and had a son and step-son.  He worked for Air Kazakhstan in a junior management position.  In 2002, Applicant and his 
wife visited Moscow and St. Petersburg with her brother and her brother's son to celebrate her graduation for a doctoral program in music.  Ex. 4 at 4; Tr. 60.  
Applicant, his wife, and in-laws also provided "modest" financial support to this family in Kazakhstan.  Ex. 4 at 4; Answer; Tr. 99.  Applicant's wife and in-laws kept in frequent touch with him by phone and e-mail.  Tr. 99. After the record closed, Applicant reported that his brother-in-law had died suddenly.<A HREF="02-16657.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Ex. 
V.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife's first cousin is a Russian citizen living in Moscow.  Tr. 60.  Applicant has stayed with this cousin on "most trips to Moscow (business + last 
summer's family vacation)."  He has direct occasional telephone and e-mail contract through the cousin's daughter who has a decent command of the English 
language.  Ex. 4 at 5.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father-in-law's second or third cousin, who resides in Moscow, is called "Auntie," and has a special relationship with Applicant's wife.  Applicant 
provides her "modest" financial assistance.  Applicant and his wife visit her whenever they are in Moscow.  Ex. 4 at 5; Tr. 60.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has neighbors/friends who were born in the old Soviet Union.  They are permanent U.S. residents and have applied for U.S. citizenship. Answer; Tr. 
73.  Applicant has frequent contact with these neighbors-once or twice a week.  Ex. 4 at 5.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Kazakhstan at least once and Russia on at least six occasions since 1994.  In 1994, he went to Russia to meet his wife; they later traveled 
to Kazakhstan.  He traveled to Russia on business twice in 1997 and twice in 2001.  Ex. 1 at 6.  Applicant and his wife visited Russia in 2002 after she received 
her Ph.D.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens of Kazakhstan residing in Applicant's home (&para; 1.a.); Applicant's brother-in-law and his 
family are citizens and residents of Kazakhstan (&para; 1.b.); Applicant's wife's cousin(&para; 1.c.) and aunt (&para; 1.d.) are citizen residents of Russia; Applicant's neighbors 
are citizens of Russia (&para; 1.e.); his brother's wife is a citizen of Russia (&para; 1.f.); and Applicant's personal friend is a citizen of Japan, but resides in the U.S. (&para; 
1.g.).  A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, and others to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.l.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant asserts he is "not susceptible to influence that would lead [him] to betray the U.S."  Tr. 15.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He believes that "ultimately the question comes down to 
[his] strength of character and loyalty to this nation."  Tr. 74.  The Government has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, that Applicant is anything but a 
loyal U.S. citizen.  However, the issue is not his loyalty, but whether he is <EM>vulnerable </EM>to foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information because of his foreign associates.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating an applicant's foreign associates, it is also appropriate to consider the significance of the applicant's spouse's ties to foreign countries.  ISCR Case 
No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002).  There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse's 
immediate family members.  ISCR Case No. 01-26893, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 505 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted each of the factual allegations in the SOR.  The question remains whether the facts are sufficient to establish any of the disqualifying 
conditions set forth in Guideline B.  Applicant's in-laws are citizens of Kazakhstan-his wife's parents in the U.S. and his wife's brother's family in Kazakhstan.  
Applicant's cousin and "Auntie" are resident citizens of Russia.  The evidence establishes Applicant's close ties of affection or obligation to these Kazakhs and 
Russians through his wife.  Applicant's sister-in-laws are Russian citizens.  Applicant has close ties of obligation to these women through his brothers.  DC 
E2.A2.1.2.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant is not bound by affection, influence, or obligation nor is subject to duress because of his 
limited contacts with a Japanese friend he made in kindergarten.<A HREF="02-16657.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Although Applicant has more contact with his Russian neighbors, the evidence is 
insufficient to establish he has ties of affection or obligation to them.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a mitigating condition if the foreign associates are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force 
an applicant to choose between loyalty to the foreign associate and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  In analyzing whether a foreign associate is in a 
position of vulnerability, it is necessary to assess the nature of the foreign country.  After the demise of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russians lost much of their 
political and economic sway in the various republics, including Kazakhstan.  Ethnic Russians represent only 3.3 percent of the total population of Kazakhstan.  
Ex. 5 at 1; Tr. 102.  Kazakhstan is a constitutional republic with a strong presidency and has been given "a relatively high rating" for complying with 
international human-rights standards.  Ex. 5 at 3; Ex. 6.  Its relations with the U.S. are good and there is no evidence it is actively seeking U.S. secrets.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither the Government nor Applicant presented any evidence concerning the nature of the government in Russia.  However, it is common knowledge that, 
although not as hostile to the U.S. as the Soviet Union was, Russia continues to operate an aggressive intelligence service that actively seeks access to U.S. 
secrets.  </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 02-27444, 2003 DOHA LEXIS 448 at *6 (Testan, A.J. Jun. 6, 2003).  Russia has assisted the U.S. in mediating international conflicts.  
While its human rights record has improved, it is still uneven.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-16657.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After carefully examining Applicant's foreign associates, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns attributable to his 
relationship with his wife's cousin and "Auntie" in Russia.  His contacts with these Russians is more than casual.  Applicant's ties to citizens of Russia are in 
large part a result of his family ties with his in-laws.  Applicant has demonstrated that his in-laws, on their own, do not represent a credible security concern to 
the U.S.  However, when considered in relation to the foreign associates in Russia, they do represent a security concern to the extent they could pressure 
Applicant, through their daughter, on behalf of those associates.  As Applicant's brother-in-law is deceased, I find the relationship between the brother-in-law's 
family and member's of Applicant's wife's family in Russia is attenuated as to not represent a security concern.</P> 
 
<P>The fact that Applicant's brother K is married to a Russian women who is not a citizen of the U.S. and still has relatives living in Russia raises a security 
concern.  Applicant failed to demonstrate that he is not bound by affection, obligation, or influence to this women and her Russian family through his own 
brother.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
