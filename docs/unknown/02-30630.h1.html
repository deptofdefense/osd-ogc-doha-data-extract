<P>Applicant engaged in underage drinking, and was caught driving under the influence (DUI) within six months of getting his driver's license at age 16. 
Following the dissolution of his first marriage in 1994/95, Applicant began frequenting dance clubs looking for female companionship, often drinking to 
intoxication. A 1996 DUI had little impact on his behavior, and in February 1999 he caused an accident involving personal injury while driving drunk. 
Convicted of felony aggravated battery, Applicant began to appreciate the consequences of drinking and driving. Remarried and in a stable lifestyle since May 
2000, Applicant continues to consume alcohol, but in moderation with no evidence of adverse impact on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. His 
abusive drinking is sufficiently of the past to mitigate the alcohol consumption concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On March 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-30630.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on alcohol consumption (Guideline G).</P> 
<P>On March 30, 2004, Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to 
me on June 8, 2004, and pursuant to notice of June 14, 2004, a hearing was scheduled for July 7, 2004. At the hearing, five Government and three Applicant 
exhibits were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant and a coworker of his, as reflected in a transcript of the hearing received on July 20, 2004.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges alcohol consumption (Guideline G) concerns because of alcohol-related criminal incidents in 1987, 1995, 1996, and 1999, and his continued 
consumption of alcohol to at least August 2002. Applicant admits the factual allegations, and his admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence, I make the following  findings:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old composites technician employed by a defense contractor since April 2002. He seeks a secret security clearance for his duties.</P> 
<P>Applicant began drinking beer every two or three months at parties with friends as a freshman in high school, usually four to eight beers to intoxication. After 
attending a party at a friend's house in December 1987, where he consumed six to eight beers, Applicant was stopped for a traffic violation by the local police. 
Licensed for less than six months at that time, he was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) as his blood alcohol content tested at .18%. He pleaded 
guilty to the offense and was sentenced to six months probation, 40 hours of community service, and six months suspension of his driver's license. He also took 
a mandated standard drunk driving course.</P> 
<P>After the DUI, Applicant continued to consume alcohol as he had been before the DUI. For the remainder of his high school years, four to six times yearly he 
attended parties where he drank four to eight beers, but he did not drive a vehicle after drinking as his parents would not allow him to use their vehicle even 
after his license was restored.</P> 
<P>From May 1990 to May 1994, Applicant served on active duty as an aviation electronics technician and structural mechanic in the United States Navy. Married 
in December 1990, Applicant did not drink very much when his ship was in home port. During the six months of each year when his ship was deployed, 
Applicant drank to excess about once per month while on liberty with shipmates. Applicant was awarded an honorable discharge from the Navy at the rank of 
petty officer third class.</P> 
<P>Following his separation from the service, Applicant moved back to his native state without his wife and young son (born March 1993).<A HREF="02-30630.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Depressed over the 
dissolution of his marriage, Applicant did not feel like going out and having fun. Consequently, he drank rarely during the latter half of 1994. Early in 1995, 
Applicant accompanied a friend to a western dance club. He enjoyed it, and began going to the club twice a month to socialize. Applicant consumed beer on 
those occasions, to intoxication about once every two months or so.</P> 
<P>In mid-March 1995, Applicant attended a party with some friends where he drank four to six beers before driving a female companion to her home. While he 
waited for her to change clothes, he drank three or more beers. Realizing he was too impaired to drive safely, he allowed her to drive them back to the party. En 
route she lost control of his truck and flipped it into a ditch. He regained consciousness at a local hospital where he was charged with DUI (2<SUP>nd</SUP> offense)  with a 
blood alcohol level of .165%. The charge was dismissed in late July 1995 when it was determined he had not been the driver.</P> 
<P>Unemployed from about May 1995, Applicant relocated in August 1995 to attend a technical school for aeronautical mechanics. Applicant started going to 
country dance clubs every two to three weeks where he drank two or three beers. Occasionally, rarely more often than once every other month, Applicant 
consumed beer to intoxication.</P> 
<P>One evening in July 1996, Applicant drank around five beers while dancing and socializing with friends. En route home he was stopped at a random sobriety 
checkpoint and arrested for misdemeanor DUI as he exhibited blood shot eyes, slurred speech, staggered gait, and an odor of alcohol on his person. The charge 
was amended to driving while impaired as his blood alcohol content tested at .09%. Applicant pleaded guilty to the amended charge in January 1997, and was 
sentenced to six months in jail (suspended), 40 hours of community service, DUI school, a $500 fine plus costs, and six months loss of license. Applicant also 
underwent a required alcohol evaluation  where he was assessed as a social drinker who abused alcohol on occasion. Although determined not to suffer from 
alcoholism, Applicant was still advised to refrain from alcohol consumption and to be very careful about amounts consumed if he did drink.</P> 
<P>In February 1997, Applicant earned his certificate as an aircraft structural mechanic. Over the 1997/98 time frame, Applicant worked as a repair assembler for a 
local company and then as a structural mechanic for a large airplane manufacturer. His consumption of alcohol averaged two to three times a month at dance 
clubs and social gatherings, four to eight beers in a given evening.</P> 
<P>In early February 1999, Applicant visited a friend of his residing in a nearby state. Applicant drank seven or eight beers in a short period of time, sharing a 
pitcher of beer with his friend and the latter's fiancee while bowling and then imbibing three or four more at a dance club. On leaving the club, Applicant took a 
wrong turn. Several miles down the road he turned around. Not familiar with the roads, he proceeded westbound in an eastbound lane, striking one vehicle 
before hitting another oncoming car head on, causing an accident with minor personal injury.<A HREF="02-30630.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant was charged with aggravated battery (severity level 5 
person felony), DUI with a blood alcohol content .168% (class B misdemeanor), and driving while suspended (class B nonperson misdemeanor).<A HREF="02-30630.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In May 1999, 
the aggravated battery charge was amended to aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (severity level 8). In August 1999, the DUI and driving while suspended 
charges were dismissed in return for Applicant pleaded guilty to aggravated battery, level 8-person felony. Applicant was sentenced in September 1999 to nine 
months in prison (suspended), fines and costs of $684.50, 40 hours of community service, 10 hours of drug/alcohol classes, and he was placed on supervised 
probation for two years with 30 days to be spent in country jail. Following a restitution hearing in October 1999, Applicant was ordered to pay $1,573.42 in 
restitution for the victim's out of pocket costs to satisfy the loan obligation on the vehicle that had been totaled in the accident. After serving the first 13 days of 
his jail term on the weekends, Applicant decided to remain in jail during the work week to complete his incarceration. He reported to his immediate lead that he 
would not be unable to report for work, but was terminated from his job in November 1999 for violating company policy of more than three days of consecutive 
absence without authorization.</P> 
<P>In February 2000, he underwent a court-ordered alcohol assessment where he was found not to have a drinking problem, but to have shown poor judgment 
where drinking and driving were involved. Advised that he was using alcohol "like liquid courage" when out with groups of people, Applicant was told he 
needed to re-evaluate the way in which he approached drinking. The February 1999 incident shocked Applicant into realizing  there were consequences to his 
drinking, "that there was more to it than trying to go out and have a good time."</P> 
<P>In May 2000, Applicant married his current wife, a woman almost 15 years his senior with three sons of her own born in 1979, 1981, and 1996, and he moved 
to his present locale where he began working as an installer in the aviation industry. He met his spouse over the Internet. In April 2001, Applicant was 
discharged from his probation for the February 1999 felony aggravated battery.</P> 
<P>In April 2002, Applicant began working for his current employer. Needing a secret clearance for his duties as a composites technician building antennas for 
fighter aircraft, Applicant completed a security clearance application on May 1, 2002, on which he was candid about his alcohol-related offenses and job 
termination from a previous employment for violation of the company policy on absenteeism. Concerning his felony conviction for aggravated battery, 
Applicant indicated since the February 1999 incident he has not driven a vehicle after consuming alcoholic beverages, drinks rarely these days, and has a 
healthy family life since remarrying.</P> 
<P>On August 16, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent about his alcohol consumption and drunk driving. Applicant 
acknowledged that "[d]uring the turbulent time following [his] divorce and unwanted separation from [his] son, [he] at times acted in a careless and unwise 
manner while out with friends." Applicant related that he now leads a responsible life, consuming alcohol only five or six times since February 1999 and not to 
excess.</P> 
<P>Sometime during the latter half of 2003, Applicant consumed four beers at his stepson's wedding reception. As of July 2004, Applicant was continuing to 
consume alcohol on rare occasion,  never more than two or three beers, at restaurants, at home with his spouse, or at barbeques with friends. It had been 
"several weeks" since he ingested any alcohol. He does not keep alcohol in the house but will purchase a 12-pack of beer if expecting guests. Applicant realizes 
his ability to stop drinking was diminished whenever he was in an environment where he was out having a good time, "wrapped up in a world that [he] thought 
revolved around female companionship." He has not been intoxicated since the incident in February 1999. His social life consists of spending time with his 
wife and young stepson. Applicant does not believe he has an alcohol problem at present. Remorseful for the shame he caused his family, Applicant consciously 
avoids situations that could get him in trouble with drinking.</P> 
<P>In his two plus years on the job for the defense contractor, Applicant has proven to be a dependable and productive employee who requires little supervision. 
His production supervisor considers him a strong contributor and valuable asset to the organization. A close friend who also works as a composites technician 
for the defense contractor has not observed Applicant to be intoxicated in the four years he has known him.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guideline G:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern is raised by Applicant's repeated drunk driving offenses, and by his abusive relationship with alcohol when out socializing at dance clubs 
from 1995 to 1999.  Those to whom classified information is entrusted must be relied on to safeguard this material both during business and non-business 
hours. The ingestion of alcohol to intoxication is incompatible with this duty due to the obvious potential for intentional or inadvertent disclosure when one is 
under the influence. Applicant committed his first DUI as a 16-year-old with less than six months of driving experience and engaged in underage abusive 
drinking on occasion throughout the remainder of high school. Yet this early abuse of alcohol can reasonably be attributed to immaturity and peer influences, 
especially where he refrained from drinking to excess during his four years in the Navy except during deployments when on liberty with shipmates. Of greater 
concern is his use of alcohol after he was divorced from his first wife and began frequenting country dance clubs in search of female companionship. Although 
he did not consume alcohol to excess on a daily basis or even every time he went out dancing, he clearly drank on repeated occasions (<EM>viz</EM>. the DUIs) leading to 
significant impairment. The 1995 DUI charge was dismissed because he was not the driver. He exhibited good judgment in recognizing that he could not drive 
safely, but his blood alcohol content of .165% confirms his intoxication on that occasion. In July 1996, he exhibited sufficient indicia of alcohol impairment 
when stopped at a sobriety checkpoint to be arrested for DUI, and he was convicted of driving while impaired. The February 1999 drunk driving is especially 
egregious, not only because it caused personal injury to another (fortunately for him minor) but also because it followed an alcohol assessment where he was 
advised to refrain from drinking altogether or to at least be careful about his consumption. Although there is no evidence Applicant has ever allowed alcohol to 
negatively influence his work performance, disqualifying conditions (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. (alcohol-related incident away from work) and E2.A7.1.2.5. (binge 
consumption to the point of impaired judgment) must be considered.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In mitigation, there is no evidence of any alcohol-related incident since February 1999. Applicant testified credibly that the incident, which despite his repeated 
drunk driving led to his first incarceration, "shook him to the core." Admittedly late in recognizing the serious consequences to drinking to excess, Applicant 
has refrained from driving after drinking, although not from all involvement with alcohol. In response to the Government's concerns about his continued 
consumption (SOR 1.g.), Applicant submits he does not abuse alcohol, imbibing "on a rare occasion" at most two or three beers when socializing with friends 
or at a restaurant with his spouse. In determining whether Applicant's ongoing consumption of alcohol presents a security risk, it is noted that nothing in the 
Directive or Executive Order 10865 prohibits drinking per se. Consumption that does not lead to occupational, social, or legal impairment is not in and of itself 
disqualifying unless it follows a diagnosis of alcoholism or alcohol abuse by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker on staff of a 
recognized treatment program.<A HREF="02-30630.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Evaluated after the 1996 and 1999 drunk driving offenses, Applicant was determined to have a tendency to abuse alcohol when 
he got together with groups of people at a club or at a party, using it "like liquid courage." Absent a clear diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcoholism by a 
qualified substance abuse professional, a negative inference of ongoing abuse is not warranted solely from the fact that he is still drinking. However, Applicant 
bears a particularly heavy burden to overcome his serious DUI history.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence of record, I conclude Applicant's attitude toward his drinking and his lifestyle have changed sufficiently  to conclude he is 
likely to maintain the sobriety he has enjoyed since February 1999. Candid with the Government about his abuse history, Applicant has not sought to minimize 
his responsibility for his actions. He expressed sincere remorse about the shame he brought upon himself and his family and consequently, a desire to avoid any 
circumstances that could lead to a recurrence. With his remarriage in May 2000, Applicant removed himself geographically from the environment where he 
drank to excess and from the need to go to bars and clubs for female companionship. He has maintained a stable lifestyle with no evidence of excessive 
consumption for five years. Security clearance decisions are not intended to punish an applicant for past wrongdoing, but instead involve an assessment of 
future risk of the exercise of questionable judgment. Given there is no indication of a recent problem (<EM>See</EM> E2.A7.1.3.2.), and the positive changes in behavior 
supportive of sobriety (<EM>See</EM> E2.A7.1.3.3.), favorable findings are returned with respect to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. of the SOR.</SPAN></P>
