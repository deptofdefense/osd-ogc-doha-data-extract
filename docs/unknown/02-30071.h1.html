<P>The Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1992.  As a dual national with Israel, however, when traveling to Israel, he was required to use an Israeli passport.  He 
has now surrendered this Israeli passport in compliance with the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM>, and has done everything possible to renounce his Israeli citizenship.  
The Applicant's Israeli brother is a bus driver.  There is no evidence that his brother has any connection with any foreign government or is in a position to be 
exploited by any government.  The Applicant also owns one-half interest in an apartment in Israel.  His financial interest in the apartment is about $50,000.  He 
plans to transfer this interest to his brother.  The Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is about $1,000,000, and his annual income is about $300,000.  Mitigation 
has been shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about February 3, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on April 28, 2003.  A notice of hearing was originally issued on May 5, 2003, setting this case for hearing on May 
23<SUP>rd</SUP>.  Pursuant to specific requests from the Applicant, which the Government did not oppose, the case was continued to and heard on July 8, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript was 
received on July 21, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged foreign preference and perceived foreign influence militate against the 
granting of a security clearance.  The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for all of the allegations.  Those admissions are adopted as Findings of Fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">47 years of age, and is the 
president of a defense contractor that  seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.d.  The Applicant served in the Israeli Army from 1976~1980, prior to his emigrating to the United States and his eventually becoming a U.S. citizen in 
1992 (Transcript (TR) at page 19 lines 12~19, and Government Exhibit (GX) 2 at page 1).  When he became a U.S. citizen, however, Israel still considered him 
to be a dual national; and as such, he retained an Israeli passport (TR at page 21 line 24 to page 22 line 10, and at page 26 line 9 to page 27 at line 10, and 
Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) 3 at pages 2~3).  As a result, when the Applicant visited Israel on several occasions during the period 1996~1999, he was required 
to use his Israeli passport (<EM>id</EM>).  Most recently, however, the Applicant has surrendered his Israeli passport to the Israeli Consulate, and he has also initiated the 
renunciation process regarding his Israeli citizenship (TR at page 20 line 16 to page 21 line 23, at page 26 lines 2~7, and AppXs A and C).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2.a.~2.c.  The Applicant's brother is a citizen of and resides in Israel (TR at page 19 lines 1~11, at page 31 lines 12~25, GX 2 at page 3, and GX 3 at page 2).  
His brother, who the Applicant has visited on numerous occasions when the Applicant traveled to Israel, is a bus driver (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant also owns one-half 
interest in an apartment in Israel (TR at page 22 line 19 to page 24 line 3, at page 32 lines 1~11, and GX 3 at page 2).  He jointly owns this apartment with his 
brother, and intends to transfer his $50,000 half interest to his brother (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is about $1,000,000, and his annual salary 
about $300,000 (<EM>ibid</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's business partner, and vice-president of their company, thinks most highly of the Applicant (AppX B).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession . . . of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Military service . . . for a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8.  A substantial financial interest in a country . . . that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct 
evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1992, under Israeli law he still retained his Israeli citizenship.  As a dual national, when entering Israel he was 
require to use his Israeli passport.  This he did on numerous occasions during the time frame 1996~1999.  Since being appraised of the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM>, 
however, the Applicant has surrendered his Israeli passport.  He has also initiated the process to surrender his Israeli citizenship, thus satisfying the last 
mitigating condition under foreign preference.  The fact that he served in the Israeli Army is not problematic.  This was done more than 12 years before he 
became a U.S. citizen, thus also satisfying the second mitigating condition under foreign preference.  Guideline C is therefore found in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's Israeli brother is a bus driver.  This brother is not connected with any government, and there is no evidence that his presence in Israel can be 
exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such attempt at exploitation.  The 
Applicant would reject any such pressure to violate U.S. security interests.  As to the Applicant's financial interests in Israel, in light of his net worth and annual 
income in the U.S., his foreign financial interests are minimal.  Furthermore, he intends to transfer his half interest in the apartment to his brother.  The first and 
last mitigating conditions under foreign influence are therefore applicable.  Guideline B is also found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign preference, and foreign influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
