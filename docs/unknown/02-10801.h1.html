<P>On April 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated May 19, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. On August 19, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material

Applicant 
had until September 27, 2003, to file a response to the FORM, and a timely response was received. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on 
October 3, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 7)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant responded to the FORM with a Certificate of Naturalization

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens and reside in Venezuela. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains nine 
allegations, 1.a. through 1.i., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all nine allegations. These allegations are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has five</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> immediate family members who are citizens of and reside in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Venezuela. The Venezuela citizenship and residency of Applicant's 
mother-in-law</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">three sisters in-law and one brother- in-law, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern 
sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  The existence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, who are citizens of and reside in 
Venezuela comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I conclude that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's in-laws in Venezuela do not constitute an unacceptable 
security risk, and that Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. This is based on several factors, including the fact that Applicant is a native born United 
States citizen, who has lived his entire life in and as a citizen of the United States only.  Applicant's wife has become a United States citizen, and the family 
members, who are of a concern, are only related to Applicant through marriage, and there has been no</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> government involvement with any of these family 
members.  MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> also applies because Applicant's contacts with his in-laws in Venezuela is casual and infrequent. Finally, MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> applies 
because while Applicant and his wife do contribute some funds to his mother-in-law and niece,  the amount is not significant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
