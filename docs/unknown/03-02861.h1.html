<P>The Applicant's parents and three siblings are citizens of and reside in the People's Republic of China (PRC).  He has frequent contact with them, and visits 
these immediate relatives on a yearly basis.  The Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that his relatives are not agents of the PRC or of any other foreign 
power.  Furthermore, he has failed to offer any evidence that their presence in the PRC could not be exploited by a foreign power.  Mitigation is not shown.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on May 18, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on June 22, 2004.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on June 28, 2004, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution 
on July 29, 2004.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's foreign influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant 
admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 40 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.f.  The Applicant's 78 year old father and 70 year old mother are citizens of and reside in the PRC (Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at page 4).  His 46 year 
old brother, 47 year old sister and 51 year old half-brother are also citizens of and reside in the PRC (GX 4 at pages 4~5).  The Applicant maintains monthly 
telephone contact with his parents, and regular contact with his siblings (GX 3 at page 1).  He has traveled to the PRC to visit his relatives every year since 
graduating from an American university with a master's degree in December of 1999 (GX 3 at page 1, and GX 4 at page 2).  Furthermore, the Applicant intends 
to continue to travel to the PRC each year (GX 3 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers absolutely nothing in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct or situation, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's parents, brother, sister and half-brother are "citizen[s] of . . . [and] present in, a foreign country," the PRC.  The first disqualifying condition is 
therefore applicable.  Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence offered by the Applicant showing that these relatives  are not "connected with . . . a foreign 
government;" and as such, the third disqualifying condition is also arguably applicable.  There are no mitigating conditions applicable under Foreign Influence, 
as the Applicant's contact with his foreign relatives is more than infrequent, and he has failed to demonstrate that he would not be subject to coercion by a 
foreign power due to his immediate family's presence in the PRC.  Guideline B is therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
