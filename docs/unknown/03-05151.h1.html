<P>Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of alcohol-related criminal offenses from 1996 until 2001. He has consumed 
alcohol since the age of 13 until October 2002. He continued to consume alcohol to the point of intoxication since completing a court ordered alcohol safety 
school. He failed to list his alcohol offenses and his use of alcohol that resulted in treatment during the past seven years on his security clearance application 
(SF 86). He also failed to list some items of his police record during the past seven years. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 20, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, </EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn signed undated statement Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. 
Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on April 7, 2004. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to 
Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond and the 
case was assigned to me on May 20, 2004.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of alcohol-related criminal offenses from 1996 until 2001. He has consumed 
alcohol since the age of 13 until October 2002. He continued to consume alcohol to the point of intoxication since completing a court ordered Alcohol Safety 
School. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and offered no evidence on his own behalf. He failed to list on his SF 86 dated September 2002, his alcohol 
offenses and his treatment and counseling relating to alcohol during the last seven years. He also failed to list some of his police record during the past seven 
years. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegations of criminal conduct raise a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J relating to a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses 
(E2.A10.1.2.2.) and allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.). No mitigating 
conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation concerning Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline G of the Directive (E2.A7.1.2.1.) raises the issue of alcohol-related incidents away from</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">work such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use and consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment 
(E2.A7.1.2.5.). The record of Applicant's offenses, convictions, and sentences clearly show that the Government has established reasons to deny him a security 
clearance because of alcohol abuse under Guideline G.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged under Guideline E is Applicant's falsification of his SF 86 by failing to disclose certain of the offenses that might indicate questionable judgment, 
unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information 
(E2.A5.1.1.). Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise 
a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
