<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On August 30, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 2, 1996 and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was reassigned to this Administrative
Judge on January 15, 1997 after having been previously assigned to another Administrative
Judge on November 4,  1996.  On February 6, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny, or
revoke Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of five exhibits;
Applicant relied on four exhibits and his own testimony.  A transcript of the proceedings was
received on February 19, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted, without explanation, the factual allegations pertaining to drug
involvement (Criterion H) set forth under subparagraphs 1.d. through 1.m., the factual allegations
pertaining to personal conduct (Criterion E) set forth under subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d., and
the factual allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (Criterion J) set forth under subparagraph
1.a. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 29 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He has worked for his
current employer since November 1994, and is currently applying for a secret clearance.  A
favorable preliminary determination could not be made on Applicant's suitability for a security
clearance  because of his drug involvement and falsification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant began using marijuana in 1980 when he was 12 years old.  Since then, he has
used it with varying frequency--at times as often as daily.  From 1982 to 1984, he used
marijuana two or three times weekly.  From 1984 to September 1989, he used it from two to
three times a week, to as often as daily.  He received treatment for alcohol and marijuana abuse
at Facility A in July 1989 and at Facility B in September 1989.  He reduced his marijuana abuse
after completing treatment;  from 1990 to November 1994, he used it only two or three times per
month.  He reduced his marijuana abuse still further after his daughter was born in November
1994.  He used marijuana the last time on June 21, 1996.  In 1987, Applicant was cited and paid
a fine as a result of possessing marijuana.  In October 1993, he was arrested for possession of
marijuana and was required to pay a fine--the amount of which has not been disclosed.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs has not been limited to his use and possession
of marijuana.  He purchased marijuana from 1986 to 1993; he sold marijuana to friends; he used
cocaine on two or three occasions between 1986 and 1988; he purchased LSD and used it on six
or eight occasions between 1986 and 1988; he purchased hashish and used it on at least six
occasions between 1986 and 1990; and he used the drug Valium which had been prescribed for
someone else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When Applicant completed his National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) on May 22, 1995,
he certified that:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">		....the entries made by me are true, complete and accurate to the
best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In response to question 23 which asked if he had used or possessed any narcotic (to include
heroin or cocaine),... hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or
hashish), Applicant answered "yes" and explained that he had used marijuana from June 1, 1986
to October 1, 1993.  He added that: "I have finally grown up and ended my usage."  In response
to question 24 which asked if he had ever been involved in the illegal purchase or sale of
marijuana or other illegal drugs, Applicant answered "yes."  He explained that he had purchased
marijuana occasionally between June 1, 1986 and October 1, 1993.  Applicant answered  "no" to
question 25 which asked  if he had ever misused a drug prescribed for himself or someone else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Later, incident to his first interview with the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) in
February 7, 1996, Applicant signed a statement in which he swore that he had last used
marijuana in January 1994 (Gov Exh. 3). In the same statement he proclaimed: "I have no
intention of using marijuana or any other illegal drugs in the future."  He subsequently admitted
in a second, signed sworn statement to the DIS on May 16, 1996, that he had used marijuana as
recently as February 1996 (Gov. Exh. 2). Again in this statement, Applicant assured the DIS: "I
can say without reservation, that I have no future intentions of ever again becoming involved
with any type of illegal drugs, to include marijuana."  However, at his administrative hearing,
Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana yet again, on June 21, 1996 (Tr. 33), more than a
month after his second DIS interview.  Applicant later estimated that he has used marijuana as
often as "dozen (or) two dozen times" since completing his NAQ on May 22, 1995 (Tr. 82-83).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has submitted letters of reference from supervisors attesting to his excellent
duty performance, loyalty and trustworthiness.  All have recommended that he be granted a
security clearance.  On his own behalf, Applicant testified that he not been truthful on his NAQ
because he was ashamed of his drug use (Tr. 31).  He has matured since becoming a father in
November 1994 (Gov. Exh. 2) and getting married in May of 1995 (Tr. 73).  His wife and
daughter are very important to him and he would not do anything that would harm them (Tr. 32).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>PROCEDURAL RULING</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to allege that Applicant had abused
marijuana until June 21, 1996, in conformance with Applicant's testimony about when he last
used marijuana (Tr. 40 ).  The motion was granted.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria H, E, and J.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion H.  Applicant has admitted
that he used marijuana regularly--as often as daily--from 1980 until June 21, 1996.  In addition to
using marijuana, he used cocaine; he purchased marijuana; he purchased and used LSD and hashish;
and he used Valium that had been prescribed for someone else.  Applicant testified that he did not
acknowledge the full extent of his marijuana abuse when he completed the NAQ in May 1995
because he was embarrassed<A HREF="96-0609.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> by his abuse of marijuana and afraid that he would lose his job if he
told the truth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's abuse of illegal drugs other than marijuana is mitigated by the passage of time
and his stated intention not to use these substances in the future.  Although favorable consideration
has been given to his outstanding work record, this record and other favorable evidence is
insufficient to overcome or mitigate the government's case with respect to his abuse of marijuana. 
Applicant abused marijuana as recently as June 1996, only seven months before his administrative
hearing.  And the credibility of his most recent statement that he does not intend to use marijuana
in the future (Tr. 32) is significantly diminished by the fact that he has failed to abide by the
assurances he has made on three previous occasions. (See Gov. Exhs.1, 2 and 3).  While he claims
that he would never do anything to hurt his wife, or his daughter who was born in November 1994,
he has obviously used marijuana on numerous occasions since they have been part of his life. If their
welfare did not provide an incentive for him to abstain from marijuana in 1995 and 1996, there is
little reason to believe that they will provide that incentive now and in the future.  Criterion H is
concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire...or deliberately providing false and misleading information...to an
investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered relevant
and material when they are capable of influencing a federal agency's decision, e.g., a decision to
grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance, Applicant's regular abuse of marijuana up to the
time he completed his NAQ in May 1995 falls well within the definition of materiality.  Also falling
within the definition of materiality, and also omitted from his NAQ, are Applicant's sale of
marijuana, his purchase and abuse of LSD and hashish, his abuse of cocaine, and his abuse of a
prescribed drug.  Applicant provided false and misleading information again in February 1996 when
he stated in his first signed, sworn statement to the DIS that he had not used marijuana since January
1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Because Applicant had provided misinformation on two occasions--in May 1995 and
February 1996--his misconduct was neither an isolated incident, nor was it far removed from the </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">present.  Although Applicant finally admitted the full extent of his marijuana and other drug abuse
during the DIS interview in May 1996, he did not make these admissions under circumstances where
he can be credited with making a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his prior falsification.  Nor is
Applicant's falsification mitigated by his explanation that he was not truthful--on his NAQ and on
his first signed, sworn statement to DIS--because he was afraid he would lose his job, and because
he was embarrassed about his marijuana abuse.  This fear and embarrassment did not provide 
motivation for him to stop using marijuana, and they do not provide mitigation for the falsification
which was made necessary by his continued marijuana use.  Criterion E is concluded against
Appellant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant's willfully withholding
information from the DoD on matters that are clearly relevant and material to his security clearance
eligibility violates 18 U.S.C.  1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential to
influence the course of his background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD. 
Criterion J. Is concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
