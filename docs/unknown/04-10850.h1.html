<P>Applicant used cocaine for a relatively brief period of time in 1986-87, and then on four occasions between 1999 and 2002. He disclosed the latter use in a 
security clearance application he submitted in June 2003, but did not disclose the earlier use in statements he provided to an investigator. Applicant credibly 
explained the omission from the statements he provided. He has mitigated the security concerns that existed in this case. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P>   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline H for drug involvement, and Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant submitted 
a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 2, 2005, requested a hearing, and denied all SOR allegations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on July 21, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 9, 2005, scheduling the hearing for September 28, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted nine documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-9. GE 1-8 were 
admitted into the record without objection, and administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 9 without objection. Applicant testified, 
called two witnesses to testify on his behalf,  and submitted one documentary exhibit consisting of numerous subparts that was marked as Applicant Exhibit 
(AE) 1, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on October 17, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved to amend SOR subparagraph 1.a by striking the words </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>from at least</EM> and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>to at least</EM>, and substituting therefore the words </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>during</EM> and

She moved to amend SOR subparagraph 2.a by inserting the word </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>caused </EM>between the words </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>You</EM> and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>falsified</EM>, by

by striking the number </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>30</EM>, and substituting therefore the number </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>27</EM>. Applicant did not object to any of the amendments, and those amendments were made on 
the face of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 45 years old, has never been married, has no dependents, but has been engaged to be married for the past several years. He graduated from high 
school in 1979, and thereafter continued to work full-time  until May 1997, for the same grocery store company that had employed him part-time while he was 
in high school. He began attending a community college in 1993, transferred at some point to a university, and obtained a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems in May 1997. He graduated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>summa cum laude</EM>. He was employed in the information technology field from the time of his college 
graduation until he was laid off in March 2002. He was unemployed until May 2003, when he was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, as a 
senior software engineer. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The testimony of Applicant's witnesses and the letters of reference he submitted indicate he has proven himself to be a valued employee to his present and past 
employers. He is considered to be a conscientious, trustworthy, and knowledgeable employee. He has earned a reputation for being honest, intelligent, and 
dependable. A number of persons, including security clearance holders, opine that Applicant can and should be entrusted with sensitive and classified 
information based upon their observations and with knowledge of his prior actions and conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">From approximately late 1986 until July 1987, Applicant used cocaine about once every two to three weeks. He used it again on four occasions between July 
1999 and December 2002 with his girlfriend. His explanation for abusing cocaine after almost 12 years abstinence was because his girlfriend suggested she 
would like to try it. They both avouch they will never abuse the substance in the future. His girlfriend purchased the cocaine from one of her friends each time 
they used it.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a security clearance application on June 5, 2003, in which he disclosed the cocaine use between 1999 and 2002 in response to a question 
asking for information about the use of illegal drugs in the preceding seven years. Applicant provided a statement about his illegal drug use to a contract 
investigator employed by the Defense Security Service on August 6, 2003. In that statement, Applicant wrote: "At the end of July 1999 I tried cocaine for the 
first time" and "I have never abused other drugs before or since."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On November 4, 2003, Applicant provided another statement to the same contract investigator in which he wrote: "These 4 occasions were the only times that 
(name omitted) used drugs and were the only times that I used drugs. . . ." Sometime after he obtained the November 2003 statement from Applicant, the 
contract investigator learned of Applicant's earlier cocaine use from psychiatric records he had obtained.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant acknowledged his earlier drug use when he was confronted with the information obtained by the investigator on March 3, 2004. He provided the 
investigator another statement on that date and explained that in the two prior statements he had only been focusing on the seven-year time frame covered by the 
question on the security clearance application and believed he was providing truthful answers about his drug use. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant elaborated on the failure to disclose the 1986-87 drug use in the statements he provided to the investigator in his SOR answer and during his 
testimony. He credibly testified and explained the interviews were long, covered many topics, were sometimes confused, and, as to the drug use, were focused 
on the drug abuse he disclosed in the security clearance application. He also credibly testified the answers he provided and the statements he wrote were in the 
context of the discussion he had with the investigator about the drug use disclosed in the security clearance application.          </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was treated by a psychiatrist for manic depressive illness from 1988 until December 1990. However, in a security clearance application he submitted 
in May 1997, he answered "No" in response to a question that asked if he had consulted with a mental health professional in the preceding seven years. He 
credibly testified he did not recall that the treatment, which ended six and one-half years before submission of the security clearance application, fell within the 
seven-year window being asked about. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the 2003 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed an August 1990 felony criminal arrest and the resulting misdemeanor conviction, and an August 
2002 traffic offense, conviction, and fine, in addition to his recent drug use. In the 1997 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed the August 1990 
felony criminal arrest and misdemeanor conviction. In the August 2003 statement, Applicant provided extensive details not only about the arrest listed in the 
2003 security clearance application, but also about several other arrests, all of which arose out of an obviously dysfunctional relationship he had with a woman 
at the time.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, Guideline H, pertaining to drug involvement, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, 
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="04-10850.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. If they do not respect 
the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used cocaine on a number of occasions in 1986-87, and four additional times between July 1999 and December 2002. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 
1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>any drug abuse </EM>applies. It has been three years since he last used cocaine, and he and his girlfriend credibly aver they will never use any controlled substance 
in the future. His work performance and the many recommendations of supervisors, co-workers, and friends who know him well and have had the opportunity 
to closely observe him vouch for his reliability, integrity, and honesty. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a 
demonstrated intent to not abuse any drugs in the future</EM> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Criminal conduct under Guideline J is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for 
access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, 
practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to his recent drug use, Applicant disclosed criminal and traffic offenses in the 2003 security clearance application, and extensive details about a 
number of alleged criminal offenses that resulted in his being arrested in the 2003 statements he provided to the investigator. He also freely disclosed his felony 
arrest in the 1997 security clearance application. His conduct in repeatedly disclosing adverse information about himself is inconsistent with the SOR 
allegations that he was deliberately attempting to conceal information about dated drug use, and mental health treatment that concluded six and one-half years 
prior to the 1997 submission of the security clearance application. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have also considered his appearance and demeanor while testifying, along with the substance of his testimony, and the written information he submitted 
explaining the omissions. Having done so, I find Applicant's explanations for not disclosing the 1986-87 drug use in the statements he provided, and the mental 
health treatment in the 1997 security clearance application credible. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not deliberately provide false information in either the 1997 security clearance application or the 2003 statements that he submitted. Because the 
criminal conduct SOR allegation is based solely upon the deliberate omission of that information, I also find he did not commit a criminal offense. Accordingly, 
no disqualifying condition applies under either Guideline E or Guideline J. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in 
this case, including Applicant's character references, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines H, E, 
and J are decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P>
