<P>In 1997, Applicant was terminated from his employment for sending sexually harassing notes to "numerous" women in the company. DOHA alleged security 
concerns from his conduct and his failure to fully admit the reasons for his termination in his security clearance application. Applicant mitigated security 
concerns raised by his answer on the security clearance application. Although the termination was not recent, Applicant refused to fully accept responsibility for 
his conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 29 December 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-24967.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal conduct) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 10 February 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to another 
judge, but was re-assigned to me on 8 September 2005. On 20 October 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 3 November 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been married for 23 years. Applicant and his wife have two children. </P> 
<P>Between January 1980 and February 1997, Applicant worked for a different defense contractor as a principal engineer. He held a security clearance during that 
period. In February 1997, Applicant was "terminated from employment" based upon an internal company investigation that found that, from the end of 1995 
through 1996, he was the author of anonymous, unsolicited sexually harassing mail to "numerous known female employees" of the company. Ex. 2. The 
investigation revealed Applicant had made several comments about female employees' physical characteristics and dress that made them uncomfortable around 
him. Ex.4.</P> 
<P>Applicant acknowledged sending one card to one woman. He claims to have no recollection of any other incidents. Yet a questioned-documents examiner 
opined Applicant wrote at least four of the alleged notes and could not be eliminated as the person who wrote three others.</P> 
<P>Applicant signed the termination notice that stated he was being discharged and the reasons for the discharge-violating the company's standards of business 
conduct by sending to numerous female employees anonymous, unsolicited mail that contained sexual innuendos, was offensive, and was unwelcome. Ex. 2. 
Applicant applied for unemployment compensation. It was originally denied because  unemployment compensation is not available to those who have been 
terminated for cause. At a hearing to determine whether he should receive unemployment compensation, the company declined to put the reasons for 
Applicant's discharge on the record. The unemployment compensation hearing examiner had to find Applicant's  discharge was not for misconduct connected 
with work. Ex. 2. Applicant was found eligible for unemployment compensation. Answer, Atch 3.</P> 
<P>Applicant completed his security clearance application on 22 May 2001 by certifying the information contained therein was "true, complete, and correct" to the 
best of his knowledge and belief. He also acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by fine and/or imprisonment under 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Question 20 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been fired from a job, quit after being told he would be fired, left by mutual 
agreement following allegations of misconduct, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or left a job for other 
reasons under unfavorable circumstances. Applicant answered "yes," identified the employer, and claimed he left a job for other reasons under unfavorable 
circumstances. In the remarks section, Applicant indicated he had been "laid off." Ex. 1 at 5.</P> 
<P>There is no evidence Applicant has been involved in any misconduct since his termination. As part of his current employer's training program, Applicant has 
received training on sexual harassment. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was terminated from his employment with a defense contractor in February 1997 for sending sexually harassing notes to 
numerous female employees (&para; 1.a) and falsified material facts on his SCA by deliberately failing to indicate that he had been terminated from his employment 
as specified in &para; 1.a (&para; 1.b). Applicant denied both allegations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern that may be disqualifying is raised by reliable, unfavorable information that shows an applicant is unreliable or exercises questionable 
judgment. DC E2.A5.1.2.1. Applicant's conduct in sending the sexually harassing notes to fellow employees demonstrates such questionable judgment. An 
applicant may mitigate personal conduct security concerns by establishing he has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress. MC E2.A5.1.3.5. Applicant is not vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress because of his misconduct. I have also 
considered that the misconduct is not recent, having occurred some eight to nine years ago.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims he never received appropriate training on sexual harassment, asserts he did no more than others with whom he worked, and he only 
"remembers" sending one note. I am concerned about his inability to fully accept responsibility for his actions. In light of the evidence of record, I find his 
assertion that he only sent one of the notes to be incredible. Under all the circumstances of this case, and after reviewing adjudicative process factors, I am 
unable to conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns about his reliability, candor, and judgment. I find against Applicant on &para; 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a security concern that may be disqualifying for an applicant to deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant and material facts from an SCA. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2. Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or if incorrect would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an 
applicant's background. ISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 at *6 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After considering all of the evidence, I conclude 
Applicant did not deliberately omit or falsify relevant and material information from his SCA.<EM> </EM>Although he could have more accurately described how he was 
terminated from his position, his answer to question 20 was sufficient to place the Government on notice that there was an issue worth investigating. I find for 
Applicant on &para; 1.b.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
