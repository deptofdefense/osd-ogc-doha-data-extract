<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April 27, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders) of 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 18, 2006, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 
and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied liberty and property without due process of law; and whether the Administrative 
Judge's adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>(1) Applicant contends she was denied liberty and property, in the form of her employment, without due process of law in contravention of the U.S. 
Constitution because she was not represented by counsel at the hearing.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that if she was as mentally impaired as 
the government asserts, then she could not effectively represent herself.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive. </P> 
 
<P>The Supreme Court has acknowledged the inherently discretionary nature of security clearance decisions and concluded "[i]t should be obvious that no one has 
a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM> 484 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988).  Given the inherently discretionary nature of security clearance 
decisions, no applicant has any reasonable expectation of having a vested interest in or right to a security clearance.  Moreover, the federal courts have 
repeatedly held there is no property right or interest in a security clearance or a job requiring a security clearance.  <EM>See Jones v. Navy, </EM>978 F.2d, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 
1992); <EM>Dorfmont v. Brown, </EM>913 F.2d 1399, 1403-04 (9<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1990), <EM>cert. denied, </EM>499 U.S. 905 (1991); <EM>Doe v. Cheney, </EM>885 F.2d 898, 909 (D.C. Cir. 1989); 
<EM>Chesna v. U.S. Department of Defense,</EM> 850 F. Supp. 110, 118-19 (D. Conn. 1994); <EM>Williams v. Reilly, </EM>743 F. Supp. 168, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).  DOHA 
proceedings are civil in nature and applicants are not entitled to the procedural protections afforded to criminal defendants.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-12199 
at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no moment in such proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0515 
at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appellate counsel contested the Administrative Judge's determination that Applicant had a personality disorder and asserted that Applicant's <EM>pro se 
</EM>representation was ineffective because she did not object to the admissibility of business records, and she failed to call an expert witness to provide testimony 
concerning her lack of a personality disorder.  However, prejudicial error was not established.  There was no showing that the records were inadmissible, or that 
any particular expert had favorable testimony to present.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that the 
Administrative Judge conducted the hearing in a professional manner, consistent with his role as an impartial presiding official.  Significantly, the Judge 
diligently inquired as to Applicant's ability and willingness to proceed.  At the beginning of the hearing, Applicant stated unequivocally that she understood she 
had the right to bring an attorney and that she was ready to proceed without one.<A HREF="02-17574.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  She also stated unequivocally that she had read and understood the 
documents the government had sent to her.<A HREF="02-17574.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Those documents included such things as the notice of hearing, the government's exhibits, and the Directive 
which governed the hearing.  The record indicates that Applicant answered questions coherently, made an opening and closing statement, questioned witnesses, 
testified on her own behalf, and offered documentary evidence in support of her case.<A HREF="02-17574.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Although </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>pro se</EM> applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they 
are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they 
fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 
(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  Because Applicant did not object to proceeding without counsel or otherwise request a continuance of her case, she was not denied 
due process under the Directive or Executive Order.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant also argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guideline I is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.   Again, the 
Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge found that the government had produced substantial evidence, in form of the expert opinion of a licensed clinical 
psychologist, that Applicant had a mental condition indicative of a defect in judgement, reliability and stability.  The Judge's decision indicates that the Judge 
weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and reasonably explained why the evidence 
which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the 
Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline I is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
