<P>Applicant's parents and two siblings are citizens and residents of Lebanon.  His brother is a citizen and resident of France. The record evidence is sufficient to 
mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from his foreign relatives.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 28, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-26535.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Security concerns 
were expressed under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 15, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On October 14, 2004, I was assigned the case. On October 15, 2004, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on November 8, 2004.  On November 16, 2004, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.). The 
record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which were received on November 19, 2004. Department Counsel having no 
objections, the documents were admitted into evidence. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security significant foreign influence.  The Applicant admits his parents and two siblings are residents of and live in Lebanon, his brother is a 
citizen and resident of France, he sends his parents support, and he has visited Lebanon six times in the last 18 years. These admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a 47 year old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since September 2002, and is seeking a security clearance.  Those that know 
him, state he is has remarkable technical ability (App Ex D). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Lebanon in 1957.  From 1977 to 1982, Applicant attended college in France, obtaining his engineering degree.  In 1983, Applicant-- 
then 26 years old--came to the U.S. on a student visa to continue his education.  In 1988, he obtained his PhD and married his wife who was born in the 
Philippines.  In August 1999, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  In August 2001, his wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Becoming a U.S. 
citizen was a dream come true for Applicant. When naturalized, Applicant took an oath to protect the U.S. and he intends to honor that oath.  Applicant 
interprets honoring that oath as doing whatever it takes to protect the United States, including bearing arms if required.  The United States is his home.  He has 
never regretted his decision to become a U.S. citizen.  No other place would have given him the opportunities he has received here.  He is free to work hard and 
free to follow his dreams. After becoming a U.S. citizen, he stated it was now up to him to make something of himself. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife have three children ages  9, 11, and 14, who are all U.S. citizens. They are involved in soccer, tennis, ballet, music, piano, and violin 
lessons.  Applicant is a good father.  His children are his priority and life. All of his children were born in the U.S. and their future is here.  Applicant and his 
wife purchased a home in 1992 worth $180,000.  While attending graduate school in Kansas, they lost an unborn child who is buried there.  Applicant was 
specifically asked if he would ever return to live in Lebanon.  Applicant was emotional when he stated he could never see leaving the U.S. and leaving behind 
the child buried in Kansas. The U.S. is their home. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and two siblings are citizens and residents of Lebanon.  He calls them monthly and talks about health, school activities, and family matters. 
His relatives do not know his employer or the nature of his work. His father, age 81, is a farmer who tends grape and cherry orchards.  His mother, age 73, is a 
homemaker.  Applicant provides his parents $1,000 per year.  Even without his support, his parents would be financially stable.  His brother is in computer 
sales and his brother's wife, also a Lebanese citizen, is a bank vice president.  Applicant's sister is a homemaker married to a retired Lebanese military 
member.  His sister's oldest child lives in Texas.  Applicant has monthly contact with this person.  His sister's other two children are permanent residents of 
Canada.  Applicant has infrequent telephonic contact with these individuals. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's other brother and his brother's wife were born in Lebanon, but are now French citizens living in France with their three children.  His brother is a 
journalist and his wife works for a cultural organization for the arts.  In 1988, his brother came to the U.S. to attend Applicant's wedding.  He has monthly 
telephone contact with his brother in France.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1986, 1993, 1994, 1997, and 1999, Applicant visited Lebanon for three weeks to a month. During the 1999 trip, Applicant and his wife stopped in France to 
visit Applicant's brother. He also visited his brother in France in 2000, following a business trip to Europe.  In 2001, he visited his parents for a week, and in 
2003 he visited Lebanon for three weeks.  Applicant's wife accompanied him on all but three of the trips. During his six visits, which were made over an 18 
year period, his parents have never asked him about his work. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a cousin who serves in the Lebanese military.  Applicant has had brief contact with his cousin during one or two of his trips to Lebanon.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's has a brother and two sisters living in the U.S.  One brother and one sister are naturalized U.S. citizens and the other sister is a permanent 
resident.  His wife has three brothers and three sisters who reside in the Philippines.  Although his wife has weekly telephone contact with her sisters in the 
U.S., Applicant has no contact with his wife's relatives. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1975 through 1991, Lebanon experienced civil war. Life in Lebanon has greatly improved since the end of the war.  Lebanon is experiencing very 
positive change, change for the better. In May 2000, Israel withdrew its military forces from a security zone in southern Lebanon. Syria has recently moved its 
military forces out of Lebanon. In May 2004, the US Department of State reissued a travel warning (Gov Ex 5) reminding U.S. citizens of ongoing safety and 
security concerns in Lebanon. The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released by the U.S. Department of State (Gov Ex 6) in February 2004, stated 
the Government's overall human rights record remains poor and serious problems remained even with improvement in some areas. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Additionally, an applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-26535.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not 
citizens of the United States, reside in a foreign country, or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could 
result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security 
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents, brother, and sister are citizens of and living in Lebanon.  He has a brother who is a citizen of and living in France.  Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) 1 (E2.A2.1.2.1.  <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies.  He has monthly telephone contact with them and has visited Lebanon six times during the last 18 years with 
his most recent visit in 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following information about Lebanon and its relations with the United States, that was administratively noticed at the government's request, is significant 
in determining whether a security concern exists under the known facts of the case.  From 1975 through 1991, Lebanon experienced civil war. Since the end of 
the war, life in Lebanon has greatly improved and Lebanon is experiencing very positive change for the better.  Israel withdrew its military forces in 2000 and 
in 2005 Syria removed its military forces from Lebanon. In May 2004, the US Department of State reissued a travel warning reminding U.S. citizens of 
ongoing safety and security concerns in Lebanon. The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released in February 2004, stated the Government's overall 
human rights record remains poor and serious problems remained even with improvement in some areas. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Mitigating Condition (MC) must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B MC 1 (<EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse. father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to person(s) involved and the United States.</EM>)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence to suggest that Applicant's family members are, or ever have been, Lebanese agents, so the issue under MC 1 is whether they are in a 
position to he exploited by Lebanon. Lebanon is a country with ongoing safety and security concerns for U.S. citizens in Lebanon. Additionally, the 
Government's overall human rights record remained poor and serious problems remained even with improvement in some areas. However, there is no 
indication that the Lebanese government has ever attempted to exploit any resident of Lebanon for the purpose of compromising a security clearance holder 
within the United States. More specific to the facts of this case. Applicant has been a resident of the United States for more than twenty two years and a citizen 
for six years. His Lebanese relatives have resided in that country during this time. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The best predictor of whether Applicant's relatives are in a position to he exploited in the future is the Lebanese government's past conduct. Since Applicant 
came to the United States in 1983 no action has been taken by the Lebanese government to exploit his relationship with relatives in Lebanon.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also receives credit under the "whole person" concept.  He earned his PhD, has a stable family life, purchased a home, and has earned  the love and 
respect of his family.  These  are all indicators of a mature, steady, responsible, and trustworthy individual.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a strong love for the United States.  Becoming a U.S. citizen was a dream come true for him. His future, and that of his wife and children, is in 
the United States.  His family appears to the typical middle class family with the children involved in sports and music lessons. Applicant and his wife are both 
first generation Americans who have been home owners since 1992. They have no intention of ever living anywhere other than the United States.  Applicant 
was emotional when he talked of the death of his unborn and the child's burial in Kansas.  He will never leave the United States and leave behind the child 
buried in Kansas.  The United States is his home.  He took an oath to protect the United States.  An oath he intends to honor. While it is impossible to say with 
certainty what would actually occur in the future, in view of Applicant's strong ties to the United States and six years of loyal citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am satisfied that Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against him.  Accordingly, 
Guideline B is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P>
