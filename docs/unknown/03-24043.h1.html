<P>Applicant drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in November 2001, and committed an alcohol-related domestic violence offense in December 
1998. He has mitigated the security concerns that arise from his alcohol consumption. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on 
February 17, 2005, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 28, 2005, who scheduled a hearing to be conducted on December 21, 2005. That judge 
granted a request for a continuance on the day of the scheduled hearing due to Applicant's attorney being ill. The case was then reassigned to me on January 23, 
2006, due to regional rotations. I caused a notice of hearing to be issued on February 16, 2006, rescheduling the hearing for March 6, 2006. The hearing was 
conducted as rescheduled.  The government submitted eleven documents that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11, and admitted into the record 
without objection. Applicant testified, called one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted nineteen documents that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits 
(AE) 1-19, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on March 15, 2006.    </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 43 years old, and has been employed by a government contractor since 1987, presently as a non destructive inspection technician in which capacity 
he supervises nine other technicians. The many letters of recommendation, performance reviews, and certificates he submitted attest to his reputation as an 
outstanding employee and technician. His professional competence, trustworthiness and dependability were evidenced by his selection to be a member of a 
team dispatched to the People's Republic of China in June 2001 to recover an American warplane that had been forced to land in that country by the Chinese. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant graduated from high school in 1980 and thereafter served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1981 until he was honorably 
discharged in January 1987. He has held a security clearance for about the past 24 years and no complaints have ever been made alleging he mishandled or 
otherwise risked the compromise of classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married in March 1988 and divorced in August 1997. He has two daughters, ages 14 and 12, who live in a foreign country with their mother. 
Applicant has lived with a woman (his fiancee) in a spouse-like relationship since September 1997, although they separated for about nine months in 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with battery and improper exhibition of a weapon in December 1998 as a result of a domestic violence incident with his fiancee. Their 
accounts of the incident are basically similar. Both had been consuming alcohol before they began to argue. She was in the kitchen of their residence and had a 
knife in her hand. He grabbed her wrists, pushed her into the pantry area of the kitchen, took the knife from her, and threatened to kill her. Her young daughter 
called the police and he was arrested. Applicant entered a plea of nolo contendere to both charges and was placed on probation for 12 months, and, as 
conditions thereof, he was ordered to perform 75 hours community service, pay fines and court costs totaling $535.00, and complete a domestic violence 
course. Applicant successfully completed all probation conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in November 2001. He estimated he had consumed between ten and twelve beers 
while watching football at a friend's house, and five to six more at a bar he stopped at while on his way home from the friend's house. He was stopped for 
speeding, failed all field sobriety tests, and registered 0.21 BAC and 0.23 BAC on breathalyzer tests. He pled guilty to the DUI and was placed on six months 
probation, and, as conditions thereof, ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling $650.00, perform 50 hours community service, complete an alcohol 
awareness program, and obtain an evaluation and complete any recommended treatment. He successfully completed all probation conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As ordered in connection with the DUI conviction, Applicant entered into a substance abuse program on March 14, 2002, and was discharged therefrom on 
June 6, 2002. His discharge summary noted that he had participated in individual and group therapy and attended open AA meetings. His overall treatment 
evaluations were above-average progress on all goals, and he completed all assignments as assigned by his primary counselor. His prognosis at discharge was 
"Excellent," and his discharge diagnosis was: 305.00 Alcohol Abuse, WOPD.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's fiancee's testimony indicated the domestic violence incident was related to the many stresses that existed at that time in their relationship, including 
her financial condition and job hunting, and Applicant's assuming a role in raising her daughter and otherwise helping around the house. She also testified he 
benefitted from the anger management class and is now better able to control his anger. Further, she testified he has not been intoxicated at any time since the 
DUI arrest, and she described his drinking habits as those of a social drinker. Applicant's testimony about his current drinking habits is also consistent with one 
who would be considered a social drinker.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">    </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G, 
pertaining to alcohol consumption, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant committed a domestic violence offense in 1998, after he and his fiancee had consumed alcohol. He committed a DUI in 2001, after consuming a large 
quantity of beer at a friend's house while watching football and thereafter in a bar. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM> applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received a diagnosis of "305.00 alcohol abuse" from a licensed mental health counselor when he was discharged from a court-ordered alcohol 
treatment program on June 6, 2002. The only basis for the diagnosis contained in the report (GE 11) is the 2001 DUI. The diagnosis is not in accord with the 
diagnostic criteria contained in the DSM-IV-TR.<A HREF="03-24043.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered the potential application of DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM> to the facts herein. The diagnosis that was made in this case is not only inconsistent with the DSM-IV-TR 
based upon the information contained in GE 11, it is inconsistent with the known history of Applicant's alcohol consumption. As such, I find this disqualifying 
condition does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant's two alcohol-related offenses were totally dissimilar and occurred three years apart. He completed a domestic violence/anger management program 
following the 1998 offense, and, according to his fiancee's testimony benefitted greatly from it. He completed an alcohol abuse program in June 2002, received 
a prognosis of "Excellent" upon discharge, and has had no alcohol related offenses since that time. Further his testimony, the testimony of his fiancee, and the 
letters of recommendation and other information available about his work performance strongly indicate there is no continuing alcohol problem. Mitigating 
Conditions (MC) 1:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>; MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a 
recent problem</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM> apply.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, including Applicant's long and distinguished 
employment history while holding a security clearance, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline G is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
