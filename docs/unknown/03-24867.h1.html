<P>Applicant is married to a citizen of the People's Republic of China (PRC), who came to the U.S. for doctoral studies in 1999. An Eagle Scout in his youth, 
Applicant has proven to be a very dedicated and capable employee for a university-affiliated laboratory, but an unacceptable risk of undue foreign influence 
persists where his spouse is a PRC citizen who travels to the PRC for her academic work, and her parents and siblings are citizens and/or residents of the PRC. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 29, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA  recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign influence (Guideline B).</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>On January 21, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me 
on May 25, 2005. On June 15, 2005, I scheduled a hearing for June 24, 2005, Applicant having waived the 15-day notice requirement. At the hearing, one 
government exhibit and nine Applicant exhibits were admitted. Applicant, his spouse, his father, and his supervisor testified, as reflected in a transcript received 
on July 8, 2005.</P> 
<P>At the government's request, I agreed to take official notice of several publications: excerpts from a declassified redacted version of a report of the U.S. House 
Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China dated January 3, 1999; the National 
Counterintelligence Center's <EM>Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage,</EM> 2000; a Congressional Research Service 
issue brief titled <EM>Intelligence Issues for Congress</EM>, dated February 1, 2005; the U.S. State Department's <EM>Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2004 
China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau)</EM> dated February 28, 2005; the State Department's <EM>Background Note: China, </EM>dated March 2005; a Congressional 
Research Service report titled<EM> China-U.S. Relations: Current Issues and Implications for U.S. Policy</EM>, dated March 24, 2005. Applicant having objected, 
administrative notice was declined as to an article reporting on the Defense Personnel Security Research Center's Espionage Database Project titled <EM>Espionage 
by the Numbers: A Statistical Overview</EM>.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The government alleged foreign influence concerns: Applicant's spouse has PRC citizenship; his parents-in-law and one brother-in-law are PRC resident 
citizens; his sister-in-law is a U.S. naturalized citizen living in the PRC; his father-in-law is employed by the PRC government as a representative of an ethnic 
minority in the PRC; and Applicant traveled to the PRC in 1998 and 2001. Applicant admitted the PRC residency and/or citizenship of these family members as 
well as his travels to the PRC, but denied his father-in-law's alleged employment with the government of the PRC. He explained his father-in-law, who speaks 
Kazakh and Uighur fluently, served as a translator at local meetings between the Uighurs and the local government during a period of Uighur unrest in 1997 and 
was not employed by the PRC government. Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence of record, and 
upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Applicant's background</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old with a doctorate degree in electrical engineering and computer science,  who has been employed as a member of the technical staff at 
a university-affiliated research and development laboratory since January 2003. He held an interim secret-level security clearance until it was withdrawn on 
issuance of the SOR, although he did not access classified information while he held the clearance. Applicant seeks a secret clearance.</P> 
<P>Applicant grew up with his two brothers, both younger, in a rural area in the U.S. where his father worked as a horticulturalist for a winery. His ancestors were 
some of the first colonists to settle the U.S. In modern times, his paternal grandfather and his grandfather's cousin worked on projects vital to the defense of the 
Nation. Other relatives, including his youngest brother, served in the military. Justifiably proud of his family's record of service, Applicant became an Eagle 
Scout during his youth, and at age 18, joined his community's volunteer ambulance corps.</P> 
<P>After graduating from his town's public high school, Applicant spent one year at a community college. He transferred to one of the schools in the state 
university system for his sophomore year. Applicant then obtained a scholarship that enabled him to finish his studies at a private technological university. He 
graduated in 1995 with bachelor degrees in electrical engineering and Japanese. After a six-month internship in Japan with a U.S. automobile manufacturing 
company, Applicant returned to the U.S. for graduate studies in electrical engineering on a three-year fellowship awarded him by the Department of Defense.</P> 
<P>In 1997, Applicant attended an environmental conference in the U.S. arranged by professors at his university and Japanese university professors to give their 
respective graduate students the opportunity to meet. Applicant was requested to attend as a translator. At this conference, Applicant exchanged electronic mail 
addresses with other attendees, including his future spouse, a PRC national. He kept in contact with her after the conference.</P> 
<P>On the completion of his masters degree in August 1997, Applicant pursued his doctorate in electrical engineering and computer science (quantum computing) 
and a Ph.D. minor in applied physics at another prestigious private university in the U.S. In July 1998, Applicant attended a scientific conference in Japan. 
Interested in visiting the PRC, Applicant contacted his future spouse. He spent a week in Beijing with her as his tour guide.</P> 
<P>After she earned her master's degree from a PRC university, she came to the U.S., where in Fall 1999 she began Ph.D. studies in environmental policy 
engineering at the same university Applicant was attending. They developed a close relationship, and in September 2001, Applicant went with her to the PRC to 
ask her parents' permission to marry. Able to exchange pleasantries only with her parents due to his rudimentary knowledge of Chinese, Applicant had to rely 
on his spouse and his spouse's sister to translate. In September 2002, Applicant and his spouse married in the U.S. Her parents did not come from the PRC for 
the wedding, but two of her siblings attended. The elder of her two brothers is studying in the U.S., and her sister, a U.S. naturalized citizen married to a U.S. 
native, was living in the U.S. at the time.</P> 
<P>Toward the end of his doctoral study, Applicant was extended several offers of academic positions, including from institutes and universities abroad. Applicant 
elected to work for his present employer, knowing he would not be free to publish or travel at will, as he wanted to reciprocate for the fellowship awarded him 
by the Department of Defense for his graduate study. In mid-January 2003, he was awarded his Ph.D. degree and began working for the defense contractor at 
the end of the month.</P> 
<P>On February 5, 2003, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) for a secret-level clearance. He disclosed the PRC residency and citizenship 
of his parents-in-law and the PRC citizenship of his spouse, who was in the process of applying for her green card. Applicant also reported his contacts with 
Japanese consular officials in the U.S. in 1993 and 1994 in application for a fellowship to attend a Japanese university, and his internships with Japanese firms 
in Japan in 1994 and 1995. Applicant also disclosed several trips abroad for education and pleasure, including his travel to the PRC in July 1998 and September 
2001.</P> 
<P>Over the five years of her doctoral study in the U.S., Applicant's spouse traveled to the PRC two or three times, staying for periods of a few weeks to a few 
months. She acquired conditional permanent resident status in the U.S. in March 2004. In about Fall 2004, Applicant's spouse became a research fellow on a 
U.S. private university's energy technology innovation project exploring ways to control automobile emissions in the PRC. This project requires repeated travel 
to the PRC to supervise collection of emissions data. She traveled to the PRC once since about September 2004 and had another trip planned for July 2005. In 
her academic work, she interfaces with local environmental protection bureau officials in the PRC and with the project's main research partner in the PRC, a 
research and technology center under state management. The director of the university's environmental policy program, who serves as her advisor, has more 
than 40 years of experience with national security issues at a classified level. He recognizes that Applicant's spouse could be approached and pressured by 
Chinese authorities to assist them in gaining access to national security information possessed by Applicant, but is confident in her determination and ability to 
recognize and resist any such pressure, including threats to her family members in the PRC, as her primary loyalties are now to her husband and her adopted 
country.</P> 
<P>Applicant's parents-in-law are resident citizens of a western province of the PRC. In the late 1950s, his parents-in-law, who were from poor families, accepted 
offers of free education from the Chinese government in return for relocating to a western province populated by Uighurs and Kazakhs. They taught in the local 
public school. Applicant's father-in-law learned the languages of the native Uighurs and of the Kazakhs, and he was eventually promoted to principal at the 
secondary school before moving on to a local junior college as headmaster in the early 1990s. After a Uighur uprising in 1997, he was "selected" by the PRC 
local government to lead a "study group" and act as a translator/mediator between the Chinese government and the Uighurs. Away from the junior college for 
about one year, Applicant returned to find his teaching position had been filled by a "crony" of the local Communist Party secretary of the school. Applicant's 
father-in-law stayed on about a year at salary but with no job appointment until he retired. Applicant's mother-in-law retired from teaching in 1993 or 1994. 
Applicant has not seen or corresponded by telephone or otherwise with his parents-in-law since his visit to them in 2001 because of the language difficulties.</P> 
<P>Applicant's spouse's sister was living in the PRC with her husband and children as of June 2005. In June 1990, she married a native U.S. citizen who was in the 
PRC teaching English. They came to the U.S. in 1991 for his education, and two sons were born to them in the U.S. She became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 
1994. In 1995, the family returned to the PRC where he sought business opportunities for his U.S. employer, a company that sold lighting, automobile, and cell 
phone manufacturing lines to companies operating in the PRC. In 1997, they started an agricultural business in the PRC, completely owned and operated by a 
company incorporated in the U.S. Two daughters born to them in the PRC are U.S. citizens and possess U.S. passports. Every two to three years, the family 
returns to the U.S. for four to six months at a time so that the children can attend U.S. schools.</P> 
<P>The elder of Applicant's spouse's two brothers is a doctoral student in metallurgy at a university in the U.S. He graduated from college in the PRC, and worked 
for more than ten years as a metallurgical engineer in an aluminum plant in the PRC before coming to the U.S. for graduate study. In August 2003, he was 
awarded his masters degree from a U.S. college. Married and the father of one child, he tried unsuccessfully to obtain U.S. immigrant visas for his spouse, an 
electrical engineer, and child. In April 2004, he filed for Canadian immigration for himself and his family. He plans to immigrate to Canada as soon as he 
finishes his Ph.D. studies in the U.S. and expects his spouse and child to have already settled there. As of June 2005, his spouse and child were still in the PRC 
living with his parents. He attended Applicant's wedding and visited with Applicant for about a day and a half in about 2003 before he started his Ph.D. studies.</P> 
<P>The younger of Applicant's spouse's brothers has his bachelors and masters (MBA) degrees from PRC universities. After this brother earned his bachelor's 
degree in agricultural economy, he worked for a few years as a reporter and assistant editor for a local newspaper. From May 1996 to April 2000, he was a sales 
manager for a private pharmaceutical company. Since earning his masters degree in July 2003, he has been employed as a project manager for a privately owned 
company in the PRC that started in the production of chemical building materials but has since diversified into petrochemicals, home appliances, sports, 
insurance, and healthcare. He is married and has a three-year-old daughter. His spouse taught in a public school training high school graduates to become 
elementary school teachers. Since 2004, she has worked as an administrative assistant in a private school providing English training classes for children. 
Applicant has never talked to this brother-in-law, who lives on the PRC's east coast.</P> 
<P>Applicant's parents-in-law are members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), although they are not currently politically active. His father-in-law had been 
CCP secretary at his school until the mid-1980s, where his role was to organize people and study policy. In 1997, Applicant's spouse joined the CCP so that she 
would have the opportunity to advance her career in the PRC ("it's just even in the academic field if you want to get promoted to be a professor, and be a party 
member, may also help your promotion." Tr. 151). Applicant's spouse had been recruited by the party because of her academic prowess. By marrying a U.S. 
citizen and choosing to remain in the U.S., she lost her party membership.</P> 
<P>Applicant is regarded by his supervisor as an outstanding employee, one of the best in his group and very dedicated and hardworking. He continues to lead a 
project on quantum computing involving fabrication of devices and then testing of those devices and to prototype other technologies with more immediate 
application, but is no longer allowed to work late into the evening or on weekends because of the withdrawal of his secret clearance. Applicant's supervisor has 
no reservations about him being granted a secret and even higher level clearance. He has been straightforward and honest in his interactions with his coworkers 
and project sponsors, informing one sponsor that a postdoctoral student on his project had misrepresented the findings of their work. On another occasion, 
Applicant received an unsolicited request by electronic mail from an unknown graduate student, whom he presumed to be Chinese, requesting that Applicant 
meet with him to discuss his doctoral research. Applicant met with this graduate student only after first checking with his supervisor at the laboratory and 
having his coworker accompany him. Applicant also appropriately handled a request from a Chinese postdoctoral student in his group on the university campus, 
who was returning to the PRC and asked to tour the laboratory facilities before he left.</P> 
<P>Applicant has been specifically briefed by his employer's security division about the security  threat posed by the PRC, including the tactics used to establish 
connections and means to thwart PRC attempts to gain information. Applicant also educated himself by reading a copy of the "Cox Report." Applicant and his 
spouse have discussed the possibility of pressure being placed on her family members in the PRC or even herself when she is in the PRC and agreed that they 
would not succumb to that kind of influence and he would contact his employer's security department.</P> 
<P><STRONG>PRC's political and economic state</STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. The PRC is 
an authoritarian state with ultimate control of all state military, commercial, and political activities constitutionally vested in the CCP. As the country transitions 
from a centrally-planned economy to a market-based economy, the PRC has gained power and influence internationally while improving the living standard for 
its citizens. The PRC is now the third largest trading partner of the U.S. and has been an important partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts since September 11, 
2001.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> PRC-U.S. relations are now "smoother" than they have been at any time since the Chinese suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The PRC has a history of targeting U.S. intelligence, economic, and technical information, including dual use technology with an ostensibly civil purpose that 
can be integrated into the PRC military and industrial base. The PRC is known to blend intelligence and non intelligence assets and to rely on different 
collection methods (<EM>e.g</EM>., including illegal transfers of technology through a third country, joint ventures with foreign firms, scientific conferences) to obtain 
military and economic information.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As of late 2004, the PRC's human rights record remained poor. Citizens lacked the freedom to express opposition to the CCP-led political system and to change 
their national leaders or form of government. In violation of internationally recognized norms, the PRC continued its crackdown on independent writers, 
religious organizations, and political dissenters,  harassing, detaining, and in some cases imprisoning, those perceived as threatening central government 
authority or national stability. Abuses included instances of torture and mistreatment of prisoners, coerced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and even 
extrajudicial killings. The PRC prosecuted individuals for subversion and leaking state secrets as a means to harass and intimidate, and infringed on 
individuals' right to privacy.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> As of March 2005, the U.S. was concerned about the PRC's track record of weapon sales, technology transfers, and nuclear 
energy assistance to "rogue" nations (Iran and Syria) and the official adoption by the PRC's National People's Congress of an "anti-secession" law, aimed at 
reining in those who advocate independence for Taiwan.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete review of the evidence of record, the following adjudicative guideline is  most pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure. (&para; E2.A2.1.1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the 
government has established its case with respect to Guideline B, foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen with family roots in the U.S. dating back to colonial days. However, his spouse is a citizen of the PRC with conditional 
permanent resident status in the U.S. Her parents and the younger of her two brothers are resident citizens of the PRC. She also has a sister who is a U.S. 
naturalized citizen married to a native-born American, but lives in the PRC. Her older brother is a PRC citizen studying in the U.S. whose spouse and child live 
in the PRC. Applicant has never met the younger of his brothers-in-law, had in-person contact with his parents-in-law only during the trip to the PRC in 2001, 
and does not correspond with them. However, the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be properly evaluated without considering the significance of his 
spouse's ties to the PRC and the possible effect they may have on Applicant's contacts under Guideline B (<EM>see</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-02452, App. Bd. Nov. 21, 
2002).  Although Applicant does not have close  bonds with his spouse's parents and siblings (excepting his sister-in-law with whom he has developed a 
personal relationship), he failed to show that he has no obligations to them or that his spouse's ties are casual rather than close. Disqualifying conditions &para; 
E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close</EM> <EM>ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country, </EM>and &para; E2.A2.1.2.2. <EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign 
influence or duress exists</EM>, clearly apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The foreign influence concerns raised by these family connections to the PRC may be mitigated where it can be determined that his relatives are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the United 
States (<EM>see</EM> MC &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.).<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant's sister-in-law owns and operates with her American-born spouse an agricultural (fruits growing) business in the 
PRC. The elder of Applicant's brothers-in-law worked for ten years as an engineer before he came to the U.S. for his graduate study in metallurgy. The younger 
is employed by a privately-owned manufacturer of chemical building materials that has diversified into petrochemicals, home appliances, sports, insurance, and 
healthcare. There is nothing about the siblings' occupations that suggest a connection to a foreign government, its military, or intelligence operations, and the 
evidence does not establish that they are or ever were foreign agents.<A HREF="03-24867.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents-in-law in contrast spent their careers in the public sector as educators. Awarded for their hard work with CCP memberships, Applicant's 
father-in-law was CCP secretary at his school until the mid-1980s, and from 1997-98 he served the local government as a mediator/leader of study groups 
following a Uighur uprising. Whether he was "selected" for this position because of his stature at the junior college, because of his trilingual abilities, or 
because of his CCP membership, he was acting as an employee or agent of a foreign government, albeit at the local level (<EM>see</EM> DC E2.A2.1.2.3. <EM>Relatives, 
cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government</EM>). Applicant's father-in-law retired in 1999 when he returned to find no open 
teaching position; his mother-in-law had retired in 1993 or 1994, so any government connection at this point is through their continued membership in the CCP. 
The U.S. State Department reports that the PRC government has always been subordinate to the CCP (<EM>see Background Note: China</EM>, March 2005), functioning 
to implement the CCP's policies. Applicant has the burden to prove his relatives are not foreign agents, although there must be evidence the foreign national is 
acting in the U.S. as an officer or employee of a foreign power or as a member of an international terrorism group, or is otherwise acting for or on behalf of a 
foreign power that engages in clandestine intelligence activities in the U.S. The evidence does not establish that Applicant's parents-in-law or his spouse has 
any active role in determining or enforcing party policy or that they are engaged in the clandestine intelligence gathering activities against the U.S. as defined in 
50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1801 and 438.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if none of his relations by marriage is a foreign agent, the inquiry in a foreign influence case is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts 
or connections are agents of a foreign power. The foreign contacts or connections must also be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a 
position of vulnerability, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability. (<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0628, App. Bd. Feb. 
24, 2003) Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative is 
improperly influenced, brought under control, or even used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although not specifically stated in the adjudicative guideline, the particular foreign country of which the relative or associate is a citizen or resides is relevant in 
determining the likelihood of undue influence being brought to bear on its citizens/residents. Countries with strong democratic institutions and respect for the 
rule of law are generally regarded as presenting less of a risk than totalitarian regimes with a record of human rights abuses, support for terrorist activities, or 
hostility to the U.S. While relations between the U.S. and the PRC are reportedly "smoother" than they have been at any time since 1989, the PRC has a history 
of targeting U.S. intelligence and economic information, and it continues to have a poor human rights record against its own citizens. Influence can also take 
forms more subtle than arbitrary detention, imprisonment, or torture. Applicant's spouse and her parents have already succumbed to a form of noncoercive 
influence, her parents by migrating to western China and becoming CCP members. Applicant testified his father-in-law did not seek to serve as a mediator for 
the local government in 1997 but felt he had no choice (Tr. 64). Furthermore, Applicant's spouse joined the CCP in 1997 for the educational and career 
benefits. The academic accomplishments of his spouse have not gone unnoticed by the PRC, as she was recruited for membership in the CCP. While she is no 
longer a member of the CCP and does not support the CCP ideology or policies, she continues to travel to the PRC for the environmental project where she 
meets with PRC officials, increasing the risk of exploitation that already exists because of her PRC citizenship and the PRC citizenship and residency of her 
family members. Mitigating condition E2.A2.1.3.1. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Aware through briefings from his employer and self-education that the PRC exploits cultural ties and connections to gain sensitive technology, Applicant 
acknowledges that there is the possibility of undue foreign influence, although he considers it highly unlikely. He and his spouse  have agreed they would report 
any improper contact or influence to his employer. (Tr. 95-96) The DOHA Appeal Board has consistently held that a statement of intention about what an 
applicant will do in the future under some hypothetical set of circumstances is not entitled to much weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has 
acted in an identical or similar manner in the past under identical or similar circumstances. <EM>(See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0511, App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000). To his 
credit, Applicant reported to his supervisor inquiries from Chinese students that he considered questionable, including a request to view the laboratory. 
However, mitigating condition &para; E2.A2.1.3.4. <EM>The individual has promptly reported to proper authorities all contacts, requests, or threats from persons or 
organizations from a foreign country, as required</EM>, has limited application in this case where Applicant's resolve has not been tested with regard to his spouse 
or her family members. Applicant is a principled person with a strong sense of obligation to his employer as well as to his country, but there is an unacceptable 
risk of undue foreign influence as long as his spouse and her family members are subject to the laws and/or physical jurisdiction of PRC authorities. SOR  &para;&para; 
1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. are resolved against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

against the plain language. While MC E2.A2.1.3.1. can be applied if an applicant satisfies only one of the two parts, a given adjudicative condition (either 
disqualifying or mitigating) cannot be read in such a way to be inconsistent with other adjudicative conditions. Under Guideline B, if foreign relations, who are
