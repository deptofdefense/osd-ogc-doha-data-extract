<P>Administrative Judge Robert R. Gales issued a decision, dated December 6, 1996, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant. Applicant appealed. For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by
not accepting a document submitted after the hearing; and (2) whether Applicant is entitled to
have the case remanded to the Administrative Judge with instructions to reopen the record to
receive and consider the document submitted by Applicant after the hearing, or to receive the
testimony of the author of that document.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
September 23, 1996 to Applicant. The SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations). </P>

<P>A hearing was held on November 13, 1996. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that he had
hoped to be accompanied by an attorney, but that the attorney was not available due to an
emergency. After a colloquy among the Administrative Judge, Applicant, and Department
Counsel, Applicant indicated he would proceed without the assistance of the attorney (Hearing
Transcript at pp. 7-9). At no time during the hearing did Applicant state or suggest that the
attorney was supposed to appear as a witness.</P>

<P>At the hearing, Applicant offered no documents for the Administrative Judge's consideration
(Hearing Transcript at p. 27). After testifying on his own behalf, Applicant rested his case
without offering any documents (Hearing Transcript at p. 72). Nothing in the record indicates or
suggests that Applicant asked the Judge for permission to submit any documents after the
hearing.</P>

<P>The case file contains a letter, dated November 14, 1996, that was mailed to the Administrative
Judge. The envelope bears a postmark of November 14, 1996. The letter is from a lawyer,
writing on behalf of Applicant as a character witness. The letter notes that the lawyer "was
unable to appear as a witness for [Applicant]" because of a medical problem.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated December 6, 1996, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant. In the decision, the Judge stated the following:</P>

<P>"On November 14, 1996, one day after the record closed, a letter was submitted in Applicant's
behalf by an attorney whom Applicant had previously identified as his prospective
representative. No mention was made that the attorney was to have appeared as a witness, rather
than as a representative. Because no request had been made by Applicant to keep the record
opened in anticipation of the submission, and the submission was made after the record had
closed, I have not considered the document nor the information appearing therein."</P>

<P>Applicant filed a timely notice of appeal. Approximately one week before Applicant's appeal
brief was due, he submitted a request to the Administrative Judge which asked the Judge to
accept the November 14, 1996 letter, or in the alternative, to reopen the record to permit the
author of that letter to testify on Applicant's behalf. At the same time, Applicant submitted to the
Appeal Board a request for an extension of time to file his appeal brief until 15 days after
Applicant received from the Judge a response to his request concerning the November 14, 1996
letter or the alternative of reopening the record.</P>

<P>By letter dated January 16, 1997, the Chairman denied Applicant's request for an extension of
time on the ground that the Administrative Judge had no jurisdiction over the case while it was
on appeal. Although Applicant filed no appeal brief, his appeal was not defaulted. Applicant's
notice of appeal will be considered as the equivalent of an appeal brief.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P>The record shows that Applicant was provided a copy of the Directive and the Prehearing
Guidance for DOHA Hearings. During the hearing, the Administrative Judge explained to
Applicant his obligation to present evidence on his behalf. Furthermore, a review of the record
shows that Applicant was given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf. At
the hearing, Applicant did not present any documentary evidence on his behalf. Nor did he
indicate to the Judge that he wanted an opportunity to submit any documents after the hearing.
Under the circumstances, Applicant had no reasonable expectation that the Judge would accept a
posthearing submission.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge had the discretion to decide whether to accept the November 14, 1996
letter that was submitted after the hearing. The Judge elected not to do so. The Board does not
have to agree with the Judge's ruling to conclude it fell within the scope of his discretion.
Nothing in the case record or Applicant's appeal persuades the Board that the Judge's ruling to
not accept the November 14, 1996 letter was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Applicant is not entitled to have the case remanded with instructions to the Administrative Judge
to reopen the record to receive and consider the November 14, 1996 letter, or to reopen the
record to receive testimony from the author of that letter. Absent harmful error, Applicant is not
entitled to have the case remanded to reopen the record for his benefit. <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.
94-1081 (August 17, 1995) at p. 6 n.8 (where applicant had the opportunity to present evidence
on his behalf, applicant is not entitled to have record reopened to give him a second chance to
make his case).</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below. Accordingly, the
Administrative Judge's December 6, 1996 decision is affirmed.</P>
