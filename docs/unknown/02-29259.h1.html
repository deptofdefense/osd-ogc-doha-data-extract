<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant served six months in prison for his involvement in a car theft in 1989 and less than a year for a drug offense in 1993-1994, and was arrested for 
battery in February 1996 and in October 1996 for a drug offense and a handgun offense, but he later became a highly respected employee of a defense 
contractor.  He received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in September 2003, but he still owes a child support arrearage and delinquent state taxes, which he 
was paying by payroll deduction until he was terminated from his latest job for lack of a security clearance.  He erroneously answered "no" to questions on his

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), E (Personal Conduct), and F (Financial 
Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 6, 2004, admitted the allegations in part and denied them in part, offered explanations, and requested a 
hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the SOR alleged the Smith Amendment, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, was applicable to this case, scheduling of the hearing was delayed by the 
moratorium imposed on Smith Amendment cases while the Department of Defense determined whether new or additional implementing guidance should be 
published.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  After the moratorium was lifted, the case was assigned to me on September 15, 2005, and heard on October 25, 2005.  DOHA received the 
transcript on November 9, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 34-year-old telecommunications technician.  He is married and has one child.  He began working for his most recent employer in December 
1999, and he received an interim clearance in February 2002.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He was terminated in April 2005 because of his lack of a final clearance, but he is eligible for 
rehiring if he is granted a clearance.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a reputation for hard work, technical skill, diligence, reliability, and high integrity. One of his supervising network engineers called him "one of 
the core technicians in his group that is always called upon to complete high visibility projects," because he is extremely reliable and diligent.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Another 
supervisor said he "demonstrates the highest levels of integrity and honesty" in his work.  A colleague regarded him as a person of "impeccable character."  His 
team leader commented on his "exemplary behavior," and his leadership and expertise.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2002, Applicant submitted an SF-86.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He answered "no" to questions 20 (arrest, charge, or conviction of any offense in last seven years), 21 (arrest 
or conviction of a felony), 22 (charge or conviction of firearms or explosives offenses), and 24 (charge or conviction of alcohol or drug offenses).  He did not 
disclose his arrests and convictions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in September 1989 for grand larceny, a felony, while he was riding in an automobile stolen by his friends.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He was convicted of the 
lesser offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and sentenced to 12 months in jail, with six months suspended, and he was placed on probation for one 
year.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1992, Applicant was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  In April 1993, he was convicted and sentenced to confinement for 15 years, with 
10 years suspended, and probation for 20 years with three years of probation supervised.  He also was ordered to undergo drug counseling.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He was paroled in 
February 1994.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  At the hearing, Applicant testified this incident occurred while he was with the same friends who had stolen the car in September 1989.  
Applicant knew his friends were cocaine dealers, and they were in a drug-dealing area when they all were arrested.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Applicant testified he did not use or sell 
drugs, even though he associated with drug users and dealers.  He admitted being identified in court as one of the dealers.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1996, Applicant was charged with battery.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  At the hearing he testified he acted in self-defense after he was attacked by several individuals who 
objected to Applicant's presence with a certain young woman.  He testified the alleged victim withdrew the charge, and "they threw it out."<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1996, Applicant and his friends were charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, possession of a handgun, 
trespassing, resisting arrest, and removal or obliterating the serial number of the handgun.  Applicant's charge of possession with intent to distribute was 
disposed of by nolle prosequi.  The remaining charges were placed on the "stet" docket, conditioned on good conduct.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant successfully completed the 
period of probation.  In an interview with a security investigator and at the hearing, Applicant maintained the cocaine and an unregistered handgun found in the 
automobile in which he and his friends were riding was not his.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  In July 2005, the records of Applicant's arrest and detention for this incident were 
expunged.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he does not use drugs and has never used drugs.  He has no friends who use drugs or deal in drugs.  He has not associated with his old 
friends since his arrest in 1996.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant told a security investigator he did not list the felonies on his SF-86 because he was not sure they were felonies.  He denied any intent to conceal 
information.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  At the hearing, Applicant seemed sincere, but his answers and overall demeanor - facial expressions, body language, and manner of speaking - 
indicated he was very confused about the disposition of his various arrests, the legal effects of charges being placed on the "stet" docket, what offenses were 
felonies, which sentences were imposed for his various offenses, and the periods of time covered by the various questions about his criminal record.  He 
testified he found the SF-86 confusing, and in hindsight he realized he should have asked his security officer for help in executing it.  Applicant did not check 
his criminal record until after he received the SOR, and his search for records of his arrests and convictions was complicated by the filing of some of the records 
under the wrong social security number.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2003, after submitting his SF-86, Applicant applied for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He received a discharge in September 2003.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  His credit report dated 
ay 4, 2004, reflected an unresolved cell phone bill, a child support arrearage of about $13,000 and three state tax liens totaling about $6,436.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  One lien was 
filed in January 2002 and two in October 2002.  Although three separate liens were filed, they all have the same case number, suggesting multiple liens may 
have been filed for a single indebtedness.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  At the hearing, Applicant admitted that when he was younger and working in fast-food restaurants or clubs, he 
sometimes filed his state tax returns late, and sometimes he did not file at all, resulting in tax delinquencies and tax liens.  He testified he did not realize until 
recently that filing late or not filing results in penalties and "they keep going up, up, up."<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was paying the child support arrearage and delinquent taxes by payroll deduction until he was terminated.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  If he receives a clearance, his former 
employer is willing to reinstate him, enabling him to resume payments on the child support and taxes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he paid the cell phone bill in July 2004.  At the hearing, he testified he had documentary proof he paid it, but he 
could not produce it.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified the debts discharged by his bankruptcy were jointly incurred by him and his wife.  His wife left him and Applicant was responsible for many 
of their joint debts, including the loan for the purchase of her automobile.  He and his wife are now in the process of obtaining a divorce.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he has changed since his criminal conduct occurred, and he now realizes the consequences of his youthful misconduct.<A HREF="02-29259.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He has been living 
within his means since his discharge in bankruptcy.  After he and his wife separated and he was suspended from work because of his lack of a clearance, he 
began living with his brother to save money.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses may raise a disqualifying condition (DC 2).  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  Applicant's record of arrests and convictions 
establishes DC 2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR &para; 1.e. alleges falsification of the SF-86.  It is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to knowingly and 
willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United 
States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I am 
satisfied, however, for the reasons set out below under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR &para; 1.f. alleges Applicant is disqualified from holding a clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  Absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, any applicant 
who "has been sentenced by a U.S. court to confinement for more than one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year" is 
disqualified from obtaining or holding a clearance by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 as amended.  Applicant was sentenced to confinement in 1989 and again in 1993, but 
each time he actually served less than one year.  Accordingly, I conclude Applicant is not disqualified from holding a clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, because 
he has never served more than one year of confinement as a result of any single sentence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on criminal conduct may be mitigated by showing the criminal behavior was not recent (MC 1) or was an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.1., E2.A10.1.3.2.  <EM>See also </EM>Directive, &para; E2.2.1.3. (frequency and recency of conduct).  I conclude MC 1 is established, because 
Applicant's last offenses occurred in November 1996, more than nine years ago, and he has not engaged in any criminal conduct since then.  MC 2 is not 
established, because Applicant was involved in multiple offenses between September 1989 and November 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An acquittal is a mitigating condition (MC 5).  Directive &para;E2.A10.1.3.5.  The charge of battery in February 1996 did not result in an acquittal after a trial on the 
merits.  Nevertheless, I conclude the withdrawal of the complaint and dismissal of the charge is a mitigating condition. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct may be mitigated by showing clear  evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6. <EM> See also</EM> Directive &para; E2.2.1.6. 
(rehabilitation and behavioral changes).  I conclude MC 6 is established, because Applicant completed his two-year probation after the November 1996 
offenses, accepted responsibility for his actions, and has become a hard-working, well-respected member of society.  He appears to have found his niche after a 
less than exemplary young adulthood.  The likelihood of recurrence is low.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several other factors enumerated in the Directive are relevant.  Applicant committed multiple offenses, some of them serious, during a seven-year-period.  
Directive &para; E2.2.1.1 (nature, extent, and seriousness of conduct).  The offenses were in large part the product of a bad choice of friends.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.2. 
(circumstances surrounding conduct).  Applicant was 17 years old when he was first arrested, and 25 years old at the time of his last arrest.  Directive &para;2.2.1.4. 
(age and maturity).  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress by threats to disclose his record is nil because his arrests and convictions are a 
matter of public record.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.8.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant misspent his youth, associating with bad friends and paying the price.  In November 1996, he was given an opportunity to change his life, and he took 
it.  He stopped associating with his old friends, found employment, and started becoming a productive member of society.  In evaluating whether he should 
receive a security clearance, I placed considerable weight on his demeanor and credibility at the hearing and the glowing testimonials he received from 
colleagues and supervisors.  After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person and weighing the disqualifying and mitigating factors, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern based on criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2..  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When, as in this case, a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does 
not establish or prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole 
to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case 
No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude DC 2 is not established.  Applicant is a man of limited education.  At the hearing, he appeared to be sincere and relatively unsophisticated.  It was 
obvious he found the SF-86 very confusing.  He denied intentionally falsifying it, and I believe him.  I conclude he has rebutted the allegations of falsifying 
three answers on his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant 
has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Applicant's financial history establishes DC 1.  His discharge in bankruptcy based on inability to otherwise resolve 
his debts establishes DC 3.  Since his discharge in bankruptcy, Applicant has lived within his means and demonstrated ability and willingness to be financially 
responsible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive &para;&para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  MC 1 is not established because Applicant's delinquent taxes and child support arrearage are not yet fully resolved.  
C 2 is not established because Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts over a substantial time period.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  
Applicant's delinquent taxes arose because of carelessness rather than circumstances beyond his control.  However, most of his other financial difficulties arose 
because of the breakup of his marriage and his inability to discharge jointly-incurred debts that his ex-wife failed to pay.  I conclude MC 3 is applicable in part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 4) applies when an applicant "has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.4.  MC 4 is applicable in part for the debts discharged in bankruptcy, because Applicant 
realized he was financially overextended, sought legal advice, and gave himself a fresh start by having his old debts discharged.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's discharge in bankruptcy does not constitute a good-faith effort to 
resolve his debts, it is relevant because Applicant is no longer vulnerable to coercion or temptation to engage in illegal conduct to generate funds.  Until he was 
recently terminated because of his lack of a clearance, he was systematically paying his delinquent taxes and the child support arrearage.  He lives modestly and 
within his means.  He testified he resolved the delinquent cell phone bill.  Although he could not produce documentation regarding the cell phone bill,  I 
attribute his inability to produce documentation to poor record management rather than financial irresponsibility or false testimony.  I conclude MC 6 is 
established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
the security concern based on financial considerations.</SPAN></P>
