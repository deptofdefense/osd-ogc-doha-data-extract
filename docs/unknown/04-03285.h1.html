<P>Applicant is a 25-year-old engineer native born U.S. citizen educated in the U.S. whose parents emigrated from Lebanon. The family lived in Lebanon for four 
years in Israeli occupied lands when Applicant was between ages nine and thirteen. He has been back twice as an adult to visit. He has a grandmother and 
several aunts and uncles still living there with whom he has occasional contact. He held an entry visa for Lebanon in his U.S. passport as a result of his first trip 
when he was nine years old but the passport containing it has expired. Applicant has mitigated security concerns. Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 27, 2004, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> 
</SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated September 2, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on January 14, 2005, and a Notice of Hearing was issued the same day for a hearing held on February 11, 2005. The Government introduced five 
exhibits at the hearing and the Applicant introduced two. All were accepted into evidence. The Applicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was 
received on February 23, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has denied all allegations under Foreign Preference-Guideline C and admitted the  allegations under Foreign Influence-Guideline B with explanatory 
information. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of 
the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an engineer. His parents emigrated from Lebanon and he was born in the U.S. In 1988 
when he was nine years old his parents and their three children went to Lebanon so that the children could better know their grandparents and become familiar 
with their ancestral lands and language. The grandparents owned and operated a small farm. The visit turned into a four year stay during which time his father 
worked in the construction industry. During the four years they lived in an area in southern Lebanon that was occupied by Israel in the period of Israeli 
occupation. (Exh. 5). Travel into the occupied area required entry visas since Israel controlled the border. Most of the better jobs were either as a result of the 
occupation or across the border in Israel which was open to those with appropriate entry documents.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>Applicant had an entry visa for entering Lebanon as a result of his family's first visit in 1988 when he was nine. Although he used it again on his two 
subsequent trips, it was in his passport which expired in January, 2004. He now has a new passport without a visa for Lebanon (Exh. A). Applicant does not 
have dual citizenship with Lebanon and the U.S. and has never held a passport of Lebanon. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After returning to the U.S. in 1992 when Applicant was 13, the family settled in a town where his father owns a small store. Applicant has returned to Lebanon 
twice to visit family with his mother in 1997 and 2001. The last trip was immediately after Applicant graduated from college and they stayed three months. 
Aside from the four years spent in Lebanon during elementary school, Applicant has been educated in the U.S. through university level and has no loyalty to 
Lebanon. He has never had a Lebanese passport. </P> 
<P>Applicant's two siblings live in the same town as their parents and are also engaged in business. Applicant is saving to buy a house in the same community for 
weekend visits as his work is over 100 miles from the family home. </P> 
<P>Applicant has elderly maternal grandparents and several aunts and uncles living in Lebanon. He has visited them when in Lebanon but his contacts from the 
U.S. are infrequent and casual in the form of telephone conversation two or three times a year. None of the relatives have ever worked for any government. He 
owns no property in Lebanon and has no interest in inheritance of any of the family property. He has no plans to visit Lebanon in the near future. </P> 
<P>Applicant is well regarded in his job, loves his work, and has great interest in what he is doing in the defense community. Applicant is single, has a U.S. born 
girlfriend, and participates in church and community activities similar to those enjoyed by young single college graduates in a metropolitan area. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are 
not citizens of the United States</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information." 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1. Having  immediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a disqualifying security concern. 
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an individual who acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country 
over the United States may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the exercise of dual citizenship (E2.A3.1.2.1.), and the possession and/or use of 
a foreign passport. Security concerns may be mitigated by a willingness to renounce dual citizenship (E2.A3.1.3.4.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never held a Lebanese passport and is not a dual citizen. The existence of a visa only permitted him to enter the country and even that is no longer 
held by him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Possible mitigating conditions (MC) that might 
be applicable are a determination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts and correspondence with foreign 
citizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The family members of the Applicant are his two grandparents who are elderly and several aunts and uncles with whom he has infrequent contact. None of 
them pose a security threat or are in a position to be influenced by the conduct of their government. While Lebanon is an unstable country in a precarious 
environment, the presence of these relatives there does not automatically disqualify Applicant from holding a security clearance. Mitigating conditions are 
applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an impressive person who, at a young age, has a responsible position of trust and is doing a good job for his company. He provided sincere and 
credible testimony as to his relationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P>
