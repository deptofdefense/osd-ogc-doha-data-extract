<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 28, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR details reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  </P> 
<P>On December 16, 2004, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. She requested a hearing. This matter was assigned to me on July 28, 2005. 
A first notice of hearing was issued on August 8, 2005, scheduling the hearing for August 24, 2005. Applicant's counsel timely filed a Motion for Continuance, 
which was granted by Order dated August 18, 2005. A second notice of hearing was issued on September 2, 2005, and a hearing was held on September 20, 
2005. Government Exhibit 1 was admitted into evidence. Applicant's Exhibits A through E were admitted into evidence. Government Exhibits I through VIII 
were admitted for administrative notice, as was Applicant's Exhibit F. Two witnesses testified for Applicant, who also testified on her own behalf. The hearing 
transcript (Tr.) was received on October 5, 2005.</P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative</P> 
<P> process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense 
decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against her.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be " in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence - Guideline B: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P>Guideline B concerns countries hostile to the U.S., although these concerns are not limited to hostile countries. "The United States has a compelling interest in 
protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether 
that person organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the</P> 
<P>United States."<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its 
relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government 
coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is 
associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B. Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A3.1.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN>(<EM>An immediate family member, or 
a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies in this case. 
Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. Applicant's mother, 
stepfather, father and sister are citizens and residents of the PRC. Based on the statements in her security clearance application, Applicant's daughter was a 
citizen of the PRC at the time the SOR was issued. The mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying 
under Guideline B.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> However, the possession of such ties may pose a security risk and raises a <EM>prima facie</EM> security concern sufficient to require an applicant to 
present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The government has not established its case under FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2. (<EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, 
if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists</EM>). While Applicant's daughter may have been a citizen of the PRC at the time the SOR was issued, 
her daughter has become a naturalized citizen and resides with Applicant in the U.S. Although her daughter was born in the PRC, she came to the U.S. as a very 
young child. The daughter returned to the PCR in 1992. She came back to the U.S. to live in 1995. Since then, the daughter has visited the PRC twice, in 1997 
and 1998. She has not been to the PRC for more than seven years. The bulk of her daughter's time in the last ten years has been in the U.S. The potential for 
adverse foreign influence or duress is minimal.</P> 
<P>I considered the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) and concluded that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>A determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States)</EM> applies. 
Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, Applicant must establish through evidence that her family members, cohabitants or associates are 
not agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) 
involved and the U.S.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The government produced substantial evidence to establish the potentially disqualifying conditions. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to 
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-10955.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> Her mother, who is a citizen of the PRC and a retired medical doctor, and her stepfather, also a citizen of the 
PRC and a retired musician, do not work for the government or the military. Her father lives in the PRC and is a retired professor, who has no connection with 
the government or the military. Her one sister lives in the PRC and works at a private college, also with no connection to the government or military. Her family 
in the PRC are not agents of a foreign power.</P> 
<P>Applicant's closest family member is her teenage daughter, who is a U.S. citizen and lives with her. She has no governmental connections and is not an agent of 
a foreign power. Because this family member is in the U.S., she is not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power.</P> 
<P>Applicant's remaining family members live in the PRC. Her parents and stepfather are retired and in no way connected with the government or military. She 
has little contact with her birth father, thus, neither would be vulnerable to coercion or exploitation. While not conclusive as to their vulnerability, her mother 
and stepfather recently visited the U.S. for six months with the approval of the PRC and have decided to immigrate to the U.S. They returned to the PRC and 
began the process for obtaining legal permission to leave the PRC. They do not anticipate problems, only that the process will take six months. Given their 
previous lengthy visit to the U.S. and their lack of fear to ask for permission to emigrate from the PRC, her mother and stepfather are not likely to be subject to 
or vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power. Her sister works in a private college. Her chosen career and her non-government work make her an 
unlikely target for coercion or exploitation by a foreign power.</P> 
<P>Finally, none of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative. Rather, these circumstances must be considered together under the 
"whole person concept", which includes consideration of Applicant's evidence of her family's absence of governmental connections; financial dependence, or 
lack thereof, on the government; or business connections susceptible to industrial espionage. To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule 
against clearing applicants with foreign family ties. Likewise, while the nature of the PRC's government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the 
U.S. are clearly not determinative, they are relevant factors to be considered.</P> 
<P>I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant would not be vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power or the government 
of the PRC. It is clear that she is cognizant of her duties in protecting national security. Her daughter is a U.S. citizen and resides with her in the U.S. Her 
mother and stepfather traveled to the U.S. with the permission of the government of the PRC. Her contacts with her father are almost nonexistent. She and her 
sister speak every few months. The possibility of pressure being exerted upon her daughter by a foreign power or entity is minimal. The likelihood of pressure 
being placed on her remaining family in the PRC is de minimus. Applicant has mitigated the government's case under Guideline B. Accordingly, for the 
reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
