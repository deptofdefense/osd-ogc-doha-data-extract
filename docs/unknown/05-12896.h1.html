<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On August 4, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On March 20, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. 
The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>April 12, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on June 28, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on 
July 3, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>July 26, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted ten exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-10, 
and admitted without objection. I took administrative notice of a November 19, 2004, memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counter-Intelligence and Security regarding the 
adjudication of trustworthiness cases. Applicant testified on her own behalf, presented one witness, and submitted two exhibits which were marked and admitted without objection as Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A-B. </SPAN> DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 4, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her SOR response, Applicant denies that the overall concerns under Guidelines B and C apply to her but admits the specific allegations under Guideline C, &para;&para; 1.a -1.e, and Guideline B, &para;&para; 2.a - 
2.c. She denies the allegations under Guideline C, &para;&para; 1.f and 1.g. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 57 years old and is employed as a project manager with a Department of Defense contractor.  She is seeking a position of public trust. She has worked for her current company since 
September 2005.  From February 1997 to September 2005, she worked as a subcontractor for the same company.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She is divorced and has three grown children and seven grandchildren. She is a 
registered nurse.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Israel. She moved to the United States in 1979.  She became a United States citizen in 1992.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After becoming a United States citizen, she continued to maintain an Israeli 
passport. She uses her United States passport upon exit and entry into the United States and her Israeli passport upon exit and entry into Israel. She uses her Israeli passport because she is required to 
do so under Israeli law.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She has traveled using her Israeli passport approximately seven times.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, the government introduced a partial copy of Applicant's Israeli passport which  had an expiration date of June 5, 2004.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant renewed her Israeli passport.  It expires in August 
2006.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She intends to renew her Israeli passport once it expires.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She is not willing to surrender her Israeli passport. She is not willing to renounce her Israeli citizenship.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Although aware of the 
</SPAN>August 16, 2000,  memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I, also known as the Money memo) which deals with 
possession of a foreign passport, Applicant will not surrender her Israeli passport because she believes the Money memo is an aggregation of the Directive's mandate that administrative judges 
weigh all the relevant factors, including those listed and those not listed by the regulations, in searching a common sense determination regarding the applicant's security risk.  She believes the 
oney memo ignores whole person factors and does not specifically define 'sanction.'<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant maintains dual citizenship with Israel because Israel is the country of her birth and she has strong feelings for her home country.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> In a signed sworn statement dated March 11, 2004, she 
indicated that her primary allegiance was to Israel but she can remain loyal to Israel and the United States.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  In a subsequent affidavit, dated January 4, 2005, Applicant states, "I have maintained 
my Israeli citizenship because I see myself as an Israeli citizen living in the U.S. for financial reasons because I work in the U.S."<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  At hearing, Applicant testified that her feelings have changed. 
She now considers herself primarily a United States citizen and the United States is her home.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has lived in the United States for 27 years. She has no financial interests in Israel.  She does not own property or pay taxes in Israel.  She has not voted in Israel since 1979.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> She has 
never served in the Israeli military.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> No foreign nationals have ever approached her with requests or threats directed at the United States. She has not engaged in activity which would make her 
vulnerable to duress or coercion.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> She has been trained about policies regarding foreign contacts by her company. She will comply with the rules if she is ever contacted by a foreign entity. She has 
never had any negative contact with Israeli government officials during her trips to Israel.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's son and daughter-in-law and daughter and son-in-law are dual citizens of the United States and Israel, who currently reside in Israel.  Her son and daughter-in-law are physical therapists. 
They have two children. Her daughter and son-in-law work as information technology project managers for a private company. They have two children. Both families live in the  Tel Aviv area. 
Applicant telephones her children who live in Israel between one and five times per month.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's two sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel.  One sister lives in Haifa. She is a registered nurse who works in a hospital. The other sister lives in Jerusalem and works as a physical 
therapist. Her husband works for IBM.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> She contacts her sisters between two to seven times per year.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> She is close to her sisters.

with her nieces and nephews.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded at work. Her supervisor testified at the hearing and provided a statement.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  She has worked with Applicant since 1997.  She was her second level supervisor for most 
of that time but became her direct supervisor when Applicant was promoted last year. Her supervisor ranks Applicant in the top 5% of the eight employees she supervises.  She indicates that the 
sensitive information they use at work is a database which contains the demographics of military members as well as military members' and their dependents' personal health information.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> She 
states that Applicant has demonstrated the highest of ethical practices in dealing with sensitive cases and material.  She notes Applicant's character is above reproach and she is a trustworthy

or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information. Contacts with citizens of other foreign countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure.(Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.)</SPAN></P>

<P>On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) issued a memorandum to clarify, Guideline C, Foreign Preference, 
relative to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  "The possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a United States passport raises doubt as to whether the person's 
allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any  clearance 
must be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the following conclusions.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>C -</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under the Foreign Preference concern.  Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  She renewed and used her Israeli passport on several 
occasions after becoming a United States citizen in 1992.  She uses her Israeli passport when she travels to and from Israel to visit family members. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP 
DC) E2.A3.1.2.1: ( <EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM>) applies as well as FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2: (<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>). By applying for and using an Israeli passport, Applicant is 
exercising dual citizenship.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, Applicant expressed some concerns about the validity of the Money memo. Section 5.1 of  Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 gives the Assistant Secretary for Command Control, 
Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I) the authority to establish adjudicative standards and issue clarifying guidance and instructions, as needed.  The ASDC3I memorandum, dated August 
16, 2000, (also known as the Money memo) is guidance clarifying the application of the foreign preference adjudicative guideline.  The memo makes clear that it is Department of Defense policy 
that possession and use of a foreign passport is a disqualifying condition that contains no mitigating factor related to applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the 
identity of the foreign country.  In order to mitigate the disqualifying factor of possession or use of a foreign passport, an applicant must surrender the foreign passport or obtain official approval for 
its use from an appropriate agency of the United States government.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DOHA Appeal Board held that under the Directive, neither a DOHA Administrative Judge nor the Appeal Board has authority or discretion to ignore, disregard, or decline to apply the ASDC3I 
memo. The Appeal Board held DOHA Administrative Judges and this Board must make decisions "in accordance with policy, procedures, and standards established by the Directive."<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the close of the record, Applicant possessed a valid foreign passport which she was not willing to surrender.  Although her foreign passport expires in August 2006, she intends to renew it. There 
is no evidence that possession and use of her foreign passport was sanctioned by the United States government. Based on these reasons, Applicant has not mitigated the foreign preference security 
concern. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the foreign influence concern, a potentially disqualifying condition is raised. The Government has established that Applicant has immediate relatives who are citizens of and reside in a 
foreign country.  Her son and his family, and her daughter and her family are dual citizens of the United States and Israel, who currently reside in Israel. Her two sisters and their extended families 
are citizens of and reside in Israel. As such, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1: (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1: (<EM>A determination that immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or 
associates) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty to the person(s) 
involved and the United States</EM>) is applicable to this case. The record evidence and the testimony at the hearing established that Applicant's family members residing in Israel are not agents of a 
foreign power.  Applicant also has the burden to meet the second prong of FI MC 1 which is whether her relatives living in Israel would be in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to her relatives and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In analyzing whether a foreign relative is in a position of vulnerability it is necessary to assess the nature of the foreign countries involved.  Israel is a parliamentary democracy.  Israel and the 
United States have a close relationship based on shared democratic values, shared religious affinities, and security interests.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  While Israel is an ally of the United States, there have been 
difficulties in U.S./Israeli relations over Israel's military sales to China, Israel's inadequate protection of United States intellectual property, and espionage-related cases.<A HREF="05-12896.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely ruled out as long as Applicant's family members are citizens of and reside in a foreign country, her substantial ties to the United 
States lead me to conclude she can be trusted to place her obligation to the United States government ahead of any sense of obligation to her family members residing in Israel. She has lived in the 
United States for over 27 years.  She has been a United States citizen for 14 years. She has a 10 year demonstrated track record of superior service with her current employer - first as a subcontractor 
and then as a full-time employee. All of her financial assets are in the United States. She informs her supervisor when she travels to Israel.  She has been trained on the proper reporting procedures if 
she is approached by foreign contacts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I acknowledge that Applicant has close ties of affection and obligation to her family members residing in Israel.  However, I find she has mitigated the foreign influence concern based on the whole 
person factors. I find Applicant has mitigated the Guideline B, Foreign Influence concern.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A concern remains under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, based on Applicant's possession and use of a foreign passport after becoming a United States citizen. </SPAN>Although evidence of mitigation is 
insufficient at this time, this decision should not be construed as a determination that Appellant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the granting of 
a trustworthiness determination.  Should Appellant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a trustworthiness determination in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of 
trustworthiness. </P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has 
negative trustworthiness implications. Although Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not in question, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that she failed to mitigate the 
trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline C, and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>

superseded by the new mitigating conditions under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  Among the new mitigating conditions is "use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security
