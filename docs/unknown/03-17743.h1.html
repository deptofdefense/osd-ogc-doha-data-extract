<P>Financially overextended after they bought a home, Applicant and his wife were given a fresh start with a bankruptcy discharge in May 1992.  In January 1997, 
Applicant's vehicle was voluntarily repossessed when he could not afford the payments, as he had to pay $10,000 in legal fees to defend his spouse who had 
driven under the influence. With a marital separation in August 1999, Applicant incurred a child support obligation of $221 per week. A strike at work from 
July 2000 to October 2000 and subsequent employment termination until April 2001substantially reduced his income to where he could not afford to make 
payments on several accounts. He has satisfied a federal income tax debt of $2,000, and brought his car loan and child support current, but has five unpaid 
delinquent accounts on which he owes a total of $10,437. Financial considerations concerns raised by these delinquent debts are mitigated by the fact they were 
incurred largely due to factors beyond his control, he is currently living within his means, and plans to satisfy these debts once his automobile loan is paid off in 
February 2005. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On February 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-17743.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on financial considerations (Guideline F).</P> 
<P>On February 27, 2004, Applicant filed his response to the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on 
June 8, 2004, and pursuant to notice of June 10, 2004, a hearing was scheduled for July 7, 2004. At the hearing held as scheduled, four Government exhibits 
and one Applicant exhibit were admitted into evidence. Applicant, his union's business manager, and two coworkers who had served as union officials in the 
past, testified as reflected in a transcript received July 20, 2004.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>DOHA alleges financial considerations concerns because of financial delinquencies  (aggregate outstanding indebtedness of $10,437 in collection or written off 
by creditors, a car loan delinquent thirty days as of December 2003, and a reported monthly net remainder of $95 with no payments made on the accounts 
charged off or in collection) after a 1992 discharge in bankruptcy. Applicant admits the indebtedness, indicating he might owe one month of late charges on his 
auto loan having paid the other late charges. Applicant's admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of 
the evidence, I render the following additional findings:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old shipper/receiver for a defense contractor. Initially employed in June 1978, Applicant has been suspended from work three times, in 
1990 following a year and a half of medical leave, for one day in 1998 for distributing union flyers at work, and from October 2000 to April 2001 for strike-related activities. He filed grievances on each occasion and was reinstated each time without loss of benefits. Applicant seeks to retain a confidential-level 
security clearance.</P> 
<P>In September 1986, Applicant married a woman who worked as a solderer for the defense contractor. In about 1989, they purchased a home, obtaining a 
primary mortgage from a financial institution that unbeknownst to them had engaged in fraudulent business practices involving their mortgage and about 40 
others in the area.<A HREF="03-17743.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Two or three years later, Applicant was notified of a federal criminal investigation against the bank and others involved. Applicant and 
several other buyers hired an attorney to represent their interests, including against the builder who initially held the second mortgages. During the pendency of 
litigation, Applicant continued to pay $1,200 per month while others stopped making their mortgage payments. Financially overextended due to car loans and 
their house payment, but not wanting the mortgage lenders to proceed against his elderly parents who had initially cosigned on his  mortgage loans, Applicant 
and his spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1991, listing a $4,600 joint debt secured by a chattel lien of $200, a primary mortgage of $112,000, 
a second mortgage of $27,275 (disputed), a $5,597.68 car loan, and $7,080.48 in unsecured debt. They were granted a discharge in May 1992, but reaffirmed 
the debt on their home. With the government takeover of the bank holding the primary mortgage, the primary mortgages were sold in a block, and Applicant 
was offered his home at $69,000. He continued to pay on this mortgage but there was a lien on the property because of this second mortgage. For a couple of 
years, the family was financially stable, and Applicant purchased a Camaro.</P> 
<P>Sometime in the mid-1990s, Applicant's spouse was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Applicant incurred about $10,000 in legal fees and 
other costs for her defense and she lost her license. She had to rely on family and friends to get her to her job with the defense contractor located in a 
neighboring state. After about a year, she took a buyout from the defense contractor and began working as an electronics tester nearer to her home with a 
consequent reduction in the family's annual income of almost $40,000. In about January 1997, Applicant's Camaro was repossessed as he could not afford the 
payments (not alleged in SOR).</P> 
<P>In August 1999, Applicant and his spouse separated.<A HREF="03-17743.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant and his spouse arranged through the state for him to pay $221 per week in child support for 
their three children born in 1987, 1989, and 1993. Applicant moved in with his mother, who has since allowed him to live with her rent free. His spouse, who 
remained in the marital home, was unable to refinance the mortgage because of the outstanding second mortgage and she stopped making payments. The house 
was eventually foreclosed on in about 2003.</P> 
<P>In August 2000, Applicant went on strike from his defense job. Without an income for the first few weeks, he and other strikers were then allowed to collect 
unemployment compensation, which for Applicant was less than what he had been making as a shipper. A third of his compensation was taken by the state and 
applied to his child support. The strike ended six weeks later in early October 2000, with the company promising the union that no disciplinary action would be 
taken against any of the employees who took part in strike activities. One week later Applicant, a union steward especially committed to his local unit, was 
terminated from his employment for allegedly making threatening remarks to a coworker who crossed their picket line. Pending resolution of his grievance 
against the company, which went to a step 5 grievance, Applicant collected unemployment compensation and performed part-time (no more than 15 hours per 
week) janitorial duties for the union, although his income was "far short" of what he had made on a regular basis. With the assistance of the international union, 
Applicant was reinstated in April 2001 to his job and position of union steward with full benefits but no back pay.</P> 
<P>On his return to work, Applicant had to repay the arrearage on his child support that had accumulated when he was out of work. He also arranged with the 
Internal Revenue Service to repay a $2,000 federal income tax obligation for 2000 at $100 per month. Applicant owed the IRS because he had to file separately 
from his spouse and she claimed the deductions for their three children. Applicant paid on the tax debt for about a year until 2003 when his income tax refund 
for the previous tax year was intercepted in satisfaction of the debt. On a security clearance application completed on April 11, 2001, two days after his 
reinstatement, Applicant disclosed that his wages had been garnisheed in February 2000 to collect child support, his vehicle had been repossessed in 1997, and 
he was delinquent on a credit card (SOR 1.e.).</P> 
<P>Due to his child support and tax payments, Applicant subsequently fell behind on other financial obligations, as follows:</P>

<P>On June 17, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). Concerning his financial delinquencies, Applicant 
attributed them to his marital separation and child support payments. He indicated that the lender for his Camaro demanded approximately $4,000 after the 
repossession that he does not intend to pay.<A HREF="03-17743.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He also indicated he would not pay the $175 dentist bill (SOR 1.c.) as his spouse had ignored his request to spread 
his son's orthodontic work out over two years to maximize the insurance benefit. He acknowledged his responsibility for half of the joint credit card debt (SOR 
1.e.) and for the balance of his charged off  VISA card debt (SOR 1.f.) and the $106 in collection for the beeper, but maintained he was unable at the time to 
satisfy the accounts. Applicant provided a personal financial statement listing a monthly net remainder of $95 after payment of expenses ($0 for rent as he was 
living with his mother) and his car loan (SOR 1.d.). He reported $1,200 in savings, but no payments on any of his delinquent accounts.</P> 
<P>Applicant's spouse is currently unemployed and making no payments on their joint debt. They remain separated and Applicant plans to file for divorce. As of 
July 2004, Applicant's take-home pay after deductions for taxes, insurance, medical (including for his children), and child support was $325 per week. Out of 
the $1,300, he was making his car payment of $399 per month (SOR 1.d.). The automobile loan of $24,000, opened in January 2000 for the purchase of a 
Cavalier, is scheduled to be paid off in February 2005. He also gives his brother $120 every three months to pay for his mother's new furnace. He has $300 on 
deposit in his checking account and little or no savings, as he had used his savings to pay off several small bills. As soon as his car is paid off, he  intends to 
contact a consumer credit counseling service for assistance in resolving the financial issues.</P> 
<P>The union's business manager is aware of the circumstances that led to Applicant's strike activities, subsequent termination from work, and reinstatement. He is 
of the opinion that the company is likely to "come down hard" on Applicant if there are any problems at work because of Applicant's commitment to the union. 
This union official has no concerns about Applicant's personal integrity even knowing that Applicant has some unpaid credit card debt. An assembly worker for 
the defense contractor, who worked alongside Applicant at one point and also served as a local union official,  has found Applicant to be "straightforward, very 
honest, passionate, perhaps to a fault even, about the things that he believes in." Applicant has expressed to him a desire to pay his outstanding debts without 
resorting to bankruptcy. Another coworker familiar with Applicant's personal situation attributes Applicant's difficulties to his marital separation and lack of 
income when he was out of work. He has found Applicant to be a concerned father to his children.</P>

It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are the most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable acts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and adjudicative guidelines, and having assessed the credibility of those who 
testified, I conclude the following with respect to guideline F:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when the applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness, 
recurring financial difficulties, or a history of not meeting his financial obligations. The Government must consider whether individuals granted access to 
classified information are because of financial irresponsibility in a position where they may be more susceptible to mishandling or compromising classified 
information. The Government has established its case under guideline F. Although both Applicant and his spouse were employed by the defense contractor, 
they became financially overextended after they bought a home  in 1989. In an effort to save their home, they obtained a Chapter 7 discharge in bankruptcy in 
1992.  While disputing the validity of a second mortgage on the property due to fraudulent lending practices, Applicant continued to make his house payment as 
he feared adverse action would be taken against his elderly parents, who had cosigned on the loans. However, with some $10,000 in legal fees and costs 
incurred after his spouse was involved in drunk driving, Applicant could no longer afford his car payments. In about January 1997, his Camaro was repossessed 
with the lender claiming an unpaid $4,000 deficiency balance on the loan. That November, a joint credit card debt of $1,493 was charged off.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After Applicant and his spouse separated in August 1999, he opened a VISA card account in August 2000 on which he ran up an unpaid balance of $3,965. 
Another delinquent credit card debt of $4,698 was placed for collection in December 2002. Two minor debts of $175 for his son's orthodontic work and $106 
for a beeper were placed for collection due to nonpayment. Disqualifying conditions E2.A6.1.2.1., <EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>, and 
E2.A6.1.2.3., <EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>, must be considered in evaluating Applicant's current security suitability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The existence of any financial delinquency, especially following a bankruptcy discharge, warrants close scrutiny, as it could indicate poor judgment and 
disregard of legitimate obligations. In this case, Applicant's financial solvency since the bankruptcy has been negatively affected by circumstances beyond his 
control (<EM>see</EM> mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3.). His spouse's driving under the influence had consequences beyond the $10,000 in legal fees for her defense. 
Subsequent transportation difficulties led her to take a job near their home, which meant a substantial reduction (about $40,000 less annually) in the household 
income. On their marital separation, Applicant incurred a child support obligation of $221 per week. The next year, his spouse refused to file taxes jointly, and 
claimed their three children as her dependents on her return. This left Applicant with an underpayment of his individual income taxes by some $2000. At the 
same time, Applicant's income was significantly reduced by the strike and his termination without pay pending his grievance action. Applicant's passion about 
the strike apparently got the better of his judgment on the picket line, but he was never arrested, and the decision to strike was not his alone.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On his return to work in April 2001, the child support arrearage and income tax debt understandably took priority. To his credit, Applicant brought his child 
support current, and he made payments totaling $1,200 to the IRS until his refund was intercepted in full satisfaction. He has been 30 days late once on his 
automobile loan opened in January 2000 before he went on strike at work, but has otherwise been current in his payments. He reported $1,200 in savings as of 
June 2003, which was what remained of his income tax refund after interception in satisfaction of his federal tax debt, but the funds went to repay debts other 
than the delinquencies listed in the SOR. As of July 2004, he did not have the funds available to satisfy all of the debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive does not require that an applicant be free of debt before he or she can be granted access. Under the "whole person" concept to be applied in 
security clearance adjudications, a person is to be viewed by the totality of their acts and omissions. Applicant showed after his 1992 bankruptcy that he could 
handle his financial matters responsibly until his spouse lost her license and had to take a position at significantly less wages. He continued to make his house 
payments even though others similarly victimized had stopped making their payments. There is no evidence Applicant continues to incur credit card debt, and 
he does not live a lavish lifestyle. While he does not pay his mother rent, he contributes to food costs and pays $120 every three months for her furnace. His 
gross income has increased by $220 monthly from what he reported in June 2003. While this suggests he should have the funds available to pay off the $106 
collection debt for the beeper without jeopardizing his finances, he testified he has only $300 in checking at present and no savings to speak of. With the payoff 
of his car loan in February 2005, Applicant will have $399 more available each month to satisfy his creditors, none of whom have contacted Applicant in the 
past year. The salient issue is whether he can be counted on to follow through on his stated intent to seek the assistance of a debt counselor. Coworkers and 
union members who know him attest to his personal integrity. Applicant is not likely to jeopardize the job he has held for some 25 years (and  the financial 
means to support his children) by failing to take action to address his old debts once he has the means to do so.</SPAN></P>
