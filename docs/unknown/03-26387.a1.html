  By asking the Board to substitute its judgment for that of the Administrative Judge, Applicant is asking for relief to which he is not entitled.  The Board's scope of review is limited under the terms of the Directive.  Applicant's ability to argue for a plausible, alternate interpretation of the record evidence  does not demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, nor does it demonstrate the Judge erred with  respect to Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  A favorable credibility determination does not preclude an unfavorable decision based on security  concerns unrelated to an applicant's candor and honesty.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Philip D. Cave, Esq</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 13, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Administrative Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated March 
28, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Board has an obligation to substitute its judgment for that of the Administrative Judge; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge properly applied Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Mitigating Condition 1.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the 
Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="03-26387.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
<P>(1) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board has an obligation to substitute its judgment for that of the Administrative Judge</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts that the Board "must substitute its 
judgement for that of the  Administrative Judge" and grant Applicant a clearance.  Applicant's assertion runs contrary to the Board's mandate as spelled out in 
the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  The Board's authority is limited to reviewing a decision to ascertain whether a party has 
identified factual or legal error by the Judge.  The Board cannot ignore a Judge's findings and conclusions, re-try a case <EM>de novo</EM>, or make findings of fact or 
reach conclusions of its own as if it were deciding the case in the first instance.  Applicant is asking for relief to which he is not entitled under the Directive.</P> 
<P>(2) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge properly applied Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that the 
circumstances of Applicant's relatives present in foreign countries did not warrant the conclusion that the second prong of Guideline B (Foreign Influence) 
itigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-26387.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> (MC1) applied to Applicant's situation.   Applicant cites several items from the record to support his position that Applicant's family 
members in Iraq, Syria, Germany and Canada are not subject to exploitation in a way that could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to them and his 
loyalty to the United States.  The Judge made findings consistent with Applicant's citations of favorable evidence.  The Judge's findings make clear that he 
considered Applicant's favorable evidence.  Nonetheless, the Judge concluded that the circumstances of Applicant's relatives were such that Applicant had not 
shown that he met the standards set forth in MC 1.  The Judge considered the relevant mitigating condition and concluded that Applicant had not sufficiently 
mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline B.<A HREF="03-26387.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate 
the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-12324 (April 21, 2005) at p. 5.  At 
most, Applicant argues for a plausible, alternate interpretation of the record evidence, but fails to demonstrate the Judge's interpretation of the record evidence 
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.</P> 
<P>Applicant's argument concerning his credibility does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  A favorable credibility determination does not preclude 
an unfavorable security clearance decision.  It is not arbitrary or capricious for an Administrative Judge to make a favorable credibility determination, but then 
consider whether the record evidence as a whole raises security concerns that are unrelated to an applicant's candor and honesty.  In this case, the Judge's 
favorable conclusions about Applicant's credibility did not preclude the Judge from reaching unfavorable conclusions about the security concerns raised under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSION</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error in the decision below.  The Administrative Judge's  March 28, 2005 decision is affirmed.</P>
