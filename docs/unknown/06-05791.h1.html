<P>Applicant a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a country other than the United States. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">applied for, and renewed an Iranian passport, 
and he used it to enter and exit Iran, after he became a United States citizen in 1989. </SPAN>His Iranian passport has now expired, although he never relinquished it to the proper Iranian authorities. 
Applicant has a very close relationship with his family, who are citizens and residents of Iran. Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 3, 2006, t</SPAN>he Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to 
an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) 
concerns related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran, and on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and citizenship of  close family 
members.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn </SPAN>response to the SOR (RSOR), dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 26, 2006</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 31, 2006, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant had until July 13, 2006,  to file a response to the FORM, and a timely response was received. 
The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 5, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 8). Applicant's response to the FORM has been identified and entered as Exhibit A.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1.c.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> under Guideline C, and three allegations, 2.a. through 2.c., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In Exhibit A, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> denies SOR allegation 1.a., and he gives further explanations to the other allegations. The admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the FORM</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, 
I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 49 year old employee of a defense contractor. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He is married and has one daughter.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from a United States university.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was born in Iran in 1957, and he moved to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> in 1977. He became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">United States citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> in 1989.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> maintained his Iranian passport, even though he was a United States citizen since 1989, and he renewed it on October 14, 2002. He traveled to Iran in 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1999, and he 
used his Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran, because he would not have been allowed to enter Iran with his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> passport (RSOR). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Iranian passport </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">expired on March 16, 2004, although he did not relinquish</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> it  to proper authorities. He has never taken any affirmative action to</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> renounce his Iranian citizenship, but he 
indicated that he was willing to do so </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit A)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who 
are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's mother, sister, and two brothers are dual citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">of Iran and the United States, and they reside in  Iran. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">His father is a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">citizen and resident of Iran</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  None of these family members has 
been or is currently connected with the Iranian government </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit A)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. There was no information in the record to indicate how often </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> communicates with any of these family members. 
However, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> described his family as being very close, and he expressed his hope and desire that they could all live together in the United States </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit A)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant traveled to Iran on two occasions in addition to those discussed above. These were in 1978 and 1979, before he became a United States citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account in 
reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent 
criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and 
surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the potential 
for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every 
case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and 
conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of 
witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a security 
concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government raise 
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United 
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side 
of denials." Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, 
Section E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's application, renewal, and use of an Iranian passport, while 
a United States citizen, must be considered adversely to Applicant and it raises serious Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A3.1.2.1.) applies because  Applicant's use of his Iranian passport after he became a United States citizen is a continuing example of Applicant's exercising dual 
citizenship. DC (E2.A3.1.2.2.) also applies because of Applicant's use of his Iranian passport. I find that his stated willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship was made in good faith and 
therefore, Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A3.1.3.4.) applies in this case under Guideline C. However, since </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> has not actually renounced his Iranian citizenship, nor has he returned his 
Iranian passport to the proper authorities, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> still has the ability to renew his Iranian passport, and because that is the only way he can see his family in Iran, I have not been convinced that he 
will not  renew his Iranian passport in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation, are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. As Applicant's family, including his mother, father, sister, and two brothers, with whom he has a self-described close relationship, are citizens and residents of Iran, a country which is 
undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 
16, 2002). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes 
Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 
2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This, Applicant has not been able to do. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are citizens and residents of Iran, comes within DC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> (E2.A2.1.2.1.), an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.  I do not find that any MC applies under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence , I conclude that the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>
