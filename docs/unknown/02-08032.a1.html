  Applicant's pro se status did not relieve him of the obligation to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his rights during the proceedings below.  Applicant fails to rebut the presumption that the Administrative Judge was fair and impartial.  An unfavorable credibility determination is not a substitute for  record evidence that Applicant used marijuana after 1997.  Although a Judge should resolve doubts about an applicant's security eligibility in favor of the  national security, such doubts must have a rational basis in the record evidence.  Silence of the Directive as to what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and  rehabilitation does not mean a  Judge has unfettered discretion in deciding what period of time is sufficient.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge  failed to articulate a rational basis for his conclusion that Applicant had not demonstrated sufficient reform despite the passage of more than six years since his  last use of marijuana.  Adverse decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 21, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated January 12, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) Whether Applicant was denied due process because Department Counsel did not submit evidence of 
Applicant's work history for the Administrative Judge's consideration, and Applicant was under the mistaken belief that his work history was part of the record 
before the Judge; (2) Whether the Administrative Judge was biased; (3) Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's use of marijuana was 
"regular"; (4) Whether the Administrative Judge erred by referring to illegal drugs other than marijuana in his decision; (5) Whether the Administrative Judge 
erred by finding that Applicant pleaded guilty or admitted sufficient facts to support a finding of guilt to a criminal offense; (6) Whether the Administrative 
Judge erred by drawing an adverse inference about Applicant's credibility based on his August 2000 statement about the extent of his marijuana use; and (7) 
Whether the Administrative Judge erred by relying on the absence of record evidence that Applicant has taken affirmative steps to show he will not use 
marijuana in the future.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied due process because Department Counsel did not submit evidence of Applicant's work history for the Administrative Judge's 
consideration, and Applicant was under the mistaken belief that his work history was part of the record before the Administrative Judge</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant 
contends he was denied due process.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) Department Counsel did not submit his employment history for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in this case; and (b) Applicant did not submit such evidence himself because he had the mistaken belief it would be part of the 
record before the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's due process claim lacks merit.  A review of the record below persuades the Board that Applicant was on reasonable notice of what was in the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM), and his obligation to offer whatever other evidence he wanted the Administrative Judge to consider in his case.  Given the 
language of the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.7 and E3.1.15, as well as the September 25, 2003 cover letter that accompanied the 
FORM, Applicant was on fair notice of: (i) the contents of the FORM; (ii) his right to object to the FORM; (iii) his right to submit a response to the FORM; (iv) 
his right to present whatever additional evidence he wanted the Judge to consider in his case; and (v) his obligation to present evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel.  Considering the procedural history of this case, it is untenable for Applicant to 
claim he believed that information in addition to the FORM was being presented to the Judge by Department Counsel.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant chose to represent himself during the proceedings below.  Applicant's <EM>pro se </EM>status did not relieve him of the obligation to take timely, reasonable 
steps to protect his rights under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Having decided to represent himself during the proceedings below, Applicant 
cannot fairly complain about the quality of his self-representation or seek to be relieved of the consequences of his decision to represent himself.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
Furthermore, Applicant's failure to take advantage of procedural opportunities available to him during the proceedings below does not constitute a violation of 
due process. <A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>(2) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge was biased</SPAN>.  Applicant also asserts: (a) the Administrative Judge's decision "is suggestive of . . . bias against marijuana 
smokers, irrespective of how isolated the use may be or may have been"; (b) the Judge's findings have the "net effect [of] overt prejudice and bias"; and (c) the 
Judge's assessment of Applicant's marijuana use "is clouded by his own prejudice" and "is overtly prejudicial."  Applicant's claims of bias are not well 
founded. </P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption an Administrative Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of 
persuasion on appeal.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes that the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is 
whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the 
fairness and impartiality of the Judge.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Bias is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions in a 
case.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error standing alone does not demonstrate the Judge was biased.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Nothing in the record below or the Administrative Judge's decision supports Applicant's claims of bias.  Applicant's strong disagreement with the Judge's 
findings and conclusions is not proof of bias.  As will be discussed later in this decision, Applicant has persuasively demonstrated harmful error by the Judge.  
But proof of such error is not proof of bias.  Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to 
question the fairness or impartiality of the Judge in this case.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's use of marijuana was "regular"</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by 
finding his past use of marijuana was regular use.  The Judge's characterization of Applicant's past marijuana use as regular in nature is a reasonable, legally 
permissible interpretation of record evidence as a whole.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by referring to illegal drugs other than marijuana in his decision</SPAN>.  Applicant also takes exception with the 
Administrative Judge's reference to illegal drugs other than marijuana (Decision at p. 3), arguing that there is no record evidence that Applicant was involved 
with any illegal drug other than marijuana.  Applicant is correct that there is no record evidence that he used any illegal drug other than marijuana.  However, 
the Judge's reference to other drug use tracks language in Applicant's written statement (FORM, Item 5 at p. 2).  Applicant cannot fairly complain that the 
Judge erred by making a finding that tracks language from his own written statement. </P> 
 
<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant pleaded guilty or admitted sufficient facts to support a finding of guilt to a criminal 
offense</SPAN>.  With respect to SOR paragraph 1.b, the Administrative Judge found that in connection with a drug-related criminal complaint, "Applicant pled guilty 
or admitted sufficient facts to support a finding of guilty" (Decision at p. 3).  Applicant challenges that finding, claiming that the record evidence shows the 
criminal case was continued without a finding and the criminal charge subsequently dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's claim of error has mixed merit.  On the one hand, Applicant's answer to the SOR indicates he pleaded guilty to the criminal charge.  Furthermore, 
in FORM Item 6 (4th page), under Disposition Method, there is an X in the box for "Guilty Plea or Admission to Sufficient Facts accepted after colloquy &amp; 278 
&sect;29D warning."  On the other hand, on the same page of FORM Item 6, under Sentence or Other Disposition, there is an X in the box for "Sufficient facts 
found but continued without guilty finding until" followed with handwriting that indicates "probation 10-14-98" and under Final Disposition, there is an X in 
the box for "Dismissed on recommendation of Probation Dept."</P> 
 
<P>The Board need not decide whether the Administrative Judge's characterization of the record evidence or Applicant's characterization of the record evidence is 
the better one with respect to the disposition of the criminal charge.  The SOR did not allege the criminal matter under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), but 
rather under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Since the Judge entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with respect 
to Guideline E, the Judge's challenged finding is moot for purposes of that Guideline.  And, since Applicant did not dispute that he used marijuana up to 
December 1997, the Judge's challenged finding did not prejudice Applicant in any meaningful way.  Even if the Board were to assume, solely for purposes of 
deciding this appeal, that Applicant's claim of error has merit, it fails to demonstrate harmful error by the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>6. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by drawing an adverse inference about Applicant's credibility based on his August 2000 statement about the extent 
of his marijuana use</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant did not fully disclose the full extent of his marijuana use when he was asked about it in 
August 2000, and that Applicant's failure to do so undercuts his credibility.  Applicant challenges that finding on appeal, arguing the Judge misinterpreted the 
record evidence on this matter.</P> 
 
<P>To decide this appeal, the Board need not decide whether Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's credibility determination is persuasive.  Even if 
the Board were to sustain the Judge's negative credibility determination, as discussed later in this decision, such a negative credibility determination would not 
be a substitute for record evidence that Applicant used marijuana after 1997.</P> 
 
<P>7. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by relying on the absence of record evidence that Applicant has taken affirmative steps to show he will not use 
marijuana in the future</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion because of the long period of Applicant's 
marijuana use (1969-December 1997) and because he did not present evidence that he had taken affirmative steps to show he will not use marijuana in the 
future (Decision at p. 5).  Applicant contends the Judge's reasoning is erroneous because: (a) the Judge's statements show he is prejudiced against Applicant; 
(b) there is no evidence suggesting that Applicant will use marijuana in the future; (c) the record evidence is "overwhelming[ly] . . . mitigating or extenuating"; 
and (d) the Judge failed to give due weight to the record evidence that Applicant has been drug-free since 1997.</P> 
 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, Applicant's claims of bias lack merit.  Applicant's remaining arguments, viewed together, demonstrate the Administrative 
Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>Although the Administrative Judge reached an unfavorable credibility determination concerning Applicant, such a negative credibility determination is not a 
substitute for record evidence that Applicant used marijuana after December 1997.  A Judge cannot find an applicant has engaged in misconduct based on 
suspicion predicated on a negative credibility determination.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The SOR did not allege that Applicant used marijuana after 1997.  Department Counsel did not 
present evidence that Applicant used marijuana after 1997.  And, Applicant did not make any admissions that he used marijuana after 1997.  Furthermore, the 
Judge did not identify any record evidence -- direct or circumstantial -- that would provide a rational basis for the Judge to infer that Applicant engaged in 
marijuana use after 1997.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  However, such silence does not means an Administrative Judge has 
unfettered discretion in deciding what period of time is sufficient to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The sufficiency or insufficiency of an applicant's 
period of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and 
rehabilitation, but rather a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence 
record within the parameters set by the Directive.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  If the record evidence shows that a significant period of time has passed without evidence of misconduct 
by an applicant, then the Judge must articulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not demonstrate changed circumstances 
or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of  reform or rehabilitation.<A HREF="02-08032.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Given the passage of more than six years since the last time Applicant used marijuana, 
the Judge properly concluded that Applicant's marijuana use was not recent within the meaning of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1.  Given the 
passage of time since 1997  without any record evidence -- direct or circumstantial -- of subsequent marijuana use and the fact that the Judge had applied Drug 
Involvement Mitigating Condition 1 in Applicant's favor, the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for deciding that an insufficient period of time had 
passed to conclude Applicant had demonstrated his marijuana use was a thing of the past.  This is not a case where there is evidence that Applicant had years of 
marijuana use mixed with intermittent, significant periods of abstinence, followed by renewed marijuana use -- circumstances that could provide a rational 
basis for doubts about whether the most recent period of abstinence was  sufficient to conclude Applicant had put marijuana use behind him.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Many of Applicant's claims of error lack merit.  However, Applicant has met his burden of demonstrating harmful error that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.</P>
