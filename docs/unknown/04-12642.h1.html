<P>Between 1998 and 2003, Applicant was arrested four times.  He had two alcohol-related incidents away from work-one in 1998 and one in 2003, both resulting 
in convictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  In June 2002 he wrongfully took another's property, resulting in a petty larceny charge and deferred 
prosecution for two years.  One month later, an affray with his son led to a criminal assault charge that was later dropped.  Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising from his history of criminal conduct and excessive alcohol consumption.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 26, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").  On 
August 10, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline J, 
Criminal Conduct, and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 30, 2005.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>I received the case assignment on December 20, 2005. <STRONG> </STRONG>With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on February 9, 
2006.  The government introduced Exhibits 1 through 9.  Applicant presented Exhibit A and testified on his own behalf. <STRONG> </STRONG>At Applicant's request I left the record 
open to afford him the opportunity to submit additional material for consideration.  On March 1, 2006, Applicant submitted Exhibit B, which I admitted without 
objection.  DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 16, 2006. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR.  (Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated August 30, 2005.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in December 1960.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  He began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in 1979.  (<EM>Id. </EM>at 2.)  He attended an 
apprentice school from 1979 to 1983, and earned a certificate as a journeyman.  (Ex. 1 at 1; Tr. at 9.)  He received a security clearance in June 1980.  (<EM>Id.</EM> at 6.)   
<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>He was married in 1979.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  Two children were born of the marriage.  (Tr. at 9.)  Applicant later separated from his wife.  <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>In August 1998, Applicant went to a local racecourse, and drank several beers while watching the races.  (Ex. 2 at 1.)  While driving home, he was stopped at a 
traffic safety checkpoint.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was .09%, above the legal limit.  (Ex. 2 at 1.)  Authorities cited him, <EM>inter alia</EM>, for Driving 
Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), a traffic offense.  (Ex. 5.)  Applicant was found guilty in accordance with his plea, and sentenced to five months 
confinement (suspended) and a $500.00 fine.  (Ex. 5 at 2.)  The court also required Applicant to attend a 16-week alcohol safety course, which Applicant 
completed in May 1999.  (Ex. 8; Ex. 9; Tr. at 25-26.)  He also attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as part of the program.  (Tr. at 33.) </P> 
<P>Applicant dated a woman for about 8 years, and they lived together for almost two years.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  Applicant and his girlfriend argued about the discipline 
of her teenaged daughter and eventually separated.  (Tr. at 22.)  In June 2002 he went to visit the woman, and learned she had purchased a new sport utility 
vehicle for the daughter.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  Applicant did not feel the child deserved the new vehicle, so he removed the temporary license plates from the vehicle 
and threw them away.  (Ex. 2 at 2; Tr. at 22.)  Shortly thereafter, authorities arrested him and charged him with petty larceny, a misdemeanor.  (Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. 6 
at 1.)  Applicant pled <EM>nolo contendere</EM>; the court found facts sufficient to find guilt, but deferred adjudication and placed Applicant on probation for two years.  
(Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. 6 at 2.)  He was prohibited from contacting his former girlfriend or her daughter.  </P> 
<P>On July 12, 2002, Applicant was preparing for a family camping trip.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  His son-a college student-came home after a day of drinking alcohol and 
did not help prepare for the trip.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  Applicant and his son got into a heated argument, which developed into a physical altercation.  The local police 
responded, arrested Applicant, and cited him for Assault and Battery on a Family Member.  (Ex. 7.)  Later, Applicant's son did not want to cooperate in the 
prosecution and the state dropped the charges.  (Ex. 2 at 3; Ex. 7 at 2.)  Applicant asserts his relationship with his son has improved dramatically since the 
incident.  (Tr. at 17.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant submitted a security clearance application in June 2003.  (Ex. 1.)  He properly reported his criminal history on the form.</P> 
<P>On November 2, 2003, Applicant was returning from a Halloween party at about 12:30 a.m.  (Ex. 2 at 3.)  According to Applicant, he was a passenger in a van 
operated by a friend.  When the friend saw a driver's safety checkpoint ahead, he pulled over, climbed into the back seat, and asked Applicant to drive.  (Ex. 2 
at 3.)  Applicant drove up to the sobriety checkpoint where local police stopped him.  Applicant took a field sobriety test; a subsequent breath test revealed a 
BAC of .11%.  (Ex. 2 at 3.)  Authorities charged Applicant with DUI-Second Offense.  (Ex. 4.)  The court found Applicant guilty of simple DUI, and sentenced 
him to five months confinement (suspended), a $250.00 fine, a suspended license for 12 months, and payment of court costs.  (Ex. 4 at 2.)  Applicant also 
completed an alcohol safety course required by the court.  (Ex. A.)  </P> 
<P>Following his second arrest for DUI, Applicant was referred to a 24-week alcohol intervention program.  (Ex. B; Tr. at 34.)  Upon admission, a certified 
substance abuse counselor diagnosed "Alcohol Abuse."  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  Between February and June 2004, Applicant attended 14 group counseling sessions and three 
individual sessions.  (Ex. B.)  He also attended AA meetings as required.  (Tr. at 33.)  Applicant maintained sobriety while in the program.  The staff discharged 
him because the treatment goals were met.  (Ex. B.)  Upon discharge, the counselor diagnosed "Alcohol Abuse (in early sustained remission)."  (Ex. B.)  
Applicant asserts he abstained from alcohol for almost one year.  (Tr. at 39.)</P> 
<P>In June 2004, a security investigator interviewed Applicant, who provided a written statement relating to his criminal offenses and alcohol usage.  (Ex. 2.)  
Applicant denied any current problem with alcohol.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  He indicated he consumed a few beers at home, and that over a weekend he may consume a 
12-pack of beer.  He stated his alcohol consumption never caused any work-related problems, and that he does not drink and drive.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)</P> 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant indicated he now drinks about six beers over a weekend, normally while watching sports on television.  (Tr. at 41.)  He denied 
drinking to the point of intoxication.  He believed he would have to consume eight or nine beers to become intoxicated.  (Tr. at 43.)  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).)  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J, Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
(Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.1.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">G, Alcohol Consumption:  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.1.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> </EM>(<EM>Id.</EM>)  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  (<EM>Id.</EM>) <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.15.)  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A10.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that "allegations or admission of criminal conduct" may be disqualifying.  Similarly, under &para; E2.A10.1.2.2 of 
the Directive, it may be disqualifying where an applicant committed "a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses."  Applicant's criminal record includes 
four arrests: two DUIs (in 1998 and again in 2003); the assault and battery charge in 2002; and the petty larceny offense.  I find both these potentially 
disqualifying conditions raised in this case.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from a history of criminal conduct may be mitigated.  Under &para; E2.A10.1.3.1 of the Directive, it may be 
mitigating when "the criminal behavior was not recent."  The Directive does not define the term "recent"; the recency of an incident is determined by 
considering all the circumstances, including the applicant's age, his pattern of behavior over a period of time, and the number of years since the last incident 
relative to the entire course of conduct.  Applicant's history of criminal involvement extends a period of about 5 years (1998 to 2003), and occurred when 
Applicant was between the ages of 37 and 41, an adult by any measure.  He had no subsequent criminal conduct for about three years.  Considering all the 
circumstances, I conclude Applicant's criminal conduct is recent and this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.2, also provides that it may be mitigating where "the crime was an isolated incident."  As noted above, Applicant had two offenses 
related to driving while under the influence of alcohol, and two other arrests (petty larceny and assault) within a few months.  His crimes are not isolated 
incidents; therefore, this potentially mitigating condition does not apply. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A10.1.3.4 of the Directive states it may be mitigating where "the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur."  Similarly, under &para; 
E2.A10.1.3.6 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  The crucial issue is whether Applicant has been 
successfully rehabilitated, so that further criminal incidents will not occur.  Applicant has the burden of demonstrating his successful rehabilitation.  Turning to 
the offenses in question, the common element is exceptionally poor judgment and the lack of self-control.  This was demonstrated when Applicant-a mature 
individual-chose to drive on two occasions after drinking excessive quantities of alcohol. <STRONG> </STRONG>It must also be noted that he completed an alcohol education course 
(including attendance at AA meetings) after the first DUI, but nonetheless drove under the influence of alcohol a second time.  I also note that after his brush 
with the law in June 2002, about one month later he was again arrested after a scuffle with his son.  These repeated incidents tend to demonstrate a lack of 
amenability to rehabilitation.  While he successfully completed the second alcohol abuse counseling program the second time, it is too early to tell if it had a 
lasting effect.  Considering all the circumstances, Applicant has not met his burden of producing clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  I conclude these 
potentially mitigating conditions do not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered the "whole person"concept and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions relevant to this guideline.  Applicant has been 
discreditably involved with law enforcement on multiple occasions, reflecting a lack of judgment or self-control unusual in someone of his age.  I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of criminal conduct.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A7.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if the evidence reveals "[a]lcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence reveals two 
incidents-in August 1998 and August 2003-where Applicant committed alcohol-related offenses away from work.  The evidence raises this potentially 
disqualifying condition.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; E2.A7.1.2.4 of the Directive, "[e]valuation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program" may be disqualifying.  After his second DUI, Applicant was diagnosed as exhibiting "Alcohol Abuse"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> by a certified 
substance abuse counselor working for the hospital's counseling program.  It is not clear whether the person making the diagnosis qualifies as a licensed clinical 
social worker" as required by the Directive; therefore, I cannot find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.  However, I will consider these 
circumstances as part of the "whole person" concept.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from excessive alcohol consumption can be mitigated.  Under the Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where "[t]he 
alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern."  Applicant's two incidents were very similar; each involved his decision to drive an automobile after having 
too much to drink in social settings.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.3.2 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "[t]he problems occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent 
problem."  Applicant's first alcohol-related incident occurred in 1998-over seven years ago.  However, the second incident happened in 2003 and is recent.  I 
conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A7.1.3.3 provides that "[p]ositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety" may also be a mitigating factor.  Following his second DUI, 
Applicant attended a second, longer alcohol abuse counseling course.  He gained an increased appreciation of the dangers of excessive drinking.  He continues 
to consume alcohol in moderation, but does not drink before driving anymore.  I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.3.4, indicates it may be mitigating where:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with 
aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at 
least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis from a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, Applicant received a diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse by a substance abuse counselor, but it is not clear whether she was a licensed clinical social 
worker as required.  Applicant participated in AA meetings as required, but no longer attends.  He abstained from alcohol for less than 12 months.  Although 
the counselor indicated he completed the treatment successfully, she did not make a prognosis.  I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply, but I 
will consider the relevant facts as part of the "whole person" concept.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature individual who worked for a 
defense contractor for many years.  His alcohol-related incidents occurred between the ages of 37 and 41-an age when he should be stable and responsible.  He 
went through an alcohol awareness program after his first DUI, but had a second incident within five years, suggesting a lack of amenability to rehabilitation.  
Although the petty larceny and assault charges are not especially serious, they reflect poor judgment and a lack of self-control.  I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of excessive alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>
