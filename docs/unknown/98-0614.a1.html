<P>Administrative Judge  Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued a decision, dated January 14, 1999, in which she concluded it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed. 
For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether paragraph 5 of the Prehearing Guidance was violated; and
(2) whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 3, 1998 to Applicant. 
The SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on December 8, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which she
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The
case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="98-0614.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>1.  <U>Whether paragraph 5 of the Prehearing Guidance was violated</U>.  Applicant submitted various documents with his
answer to the SOR.  At the hearing, the Department Counsel asked that the documents be severed from Applicant's
answer and Applicant be given the opportunity to offer them as exhibits, subject to any objections made by Department
Counsel.  The Judge granted Department Counsel's request and returned the documents to Applicant.  During the hearing,
Applicant offered most of those documents as exhibits on his behalf.</P>

<P>On appeal, Applicant contends that paragraph 5 of the Prehearing Guidance for DOHA hearings (Prehearing Guidance)<A HREF="98-0614.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
was violated because: (a) Applicant was not present when the Administrative Judge received Applicant's answer to the
SOR (with the documents attached to it by Applicant); and (b) the documents were returned to Applicant at the hearing,
not before the hearing.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal arguments fail to demonstrate the Administrative Judge acted contrary to Paragraph 5 of the Prehearing
Guidance.  A careful reading of Paragraph 5 shows that it specifically addresses the issue of what should be done if
documents attached to an applicant's answer to the SOR were returned to the applicant before the hearing, but it does not
specifically address the issue of what should be done if documents attached to an applicant's answer to the SOR were not
returned to the applicant before the hearing.  In this case, the Judge was faced with the second situation.  Since that second
situation is not addressed by Paragraph 5, the Judge's handling, at the hearing, of the documents attached to Applicant's
answer to the SOR was not in violation of Paragraph 5.  Even if the Board were to assume solely for the sake of argument
that Paragraph 5 was not followed when the Administrative Judge received Applicant's answer to the SOR (with the
documents Applicant submitted with it) without Applicant being present, Applicant has failed to show how he suffered
any prejudice or harm to his right to a hearing or his right to present evidence on his behalf.  Absent any showing of such
prejudice or harm to Applicant, any putative noncompliance with Paragraph 5 does not warrant remand or reversal.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>.  Applicant argues: (a) the
Administrative Judge ignored many facts that favor Applicant; (b) the Judge erred by finding Applicant's federal tax debt
was mitigated, but finding Applicant's consumer debts were not mitigated; (c) the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to
the evidence that Applicant's failure to make payments to his creditors in 1996-1997 was caused by a decline in his wages;
(d) the Judge erred by finding Applicant was financially overextended in 1995; (e) the Judge ignored the evidence that
Applicant closed various accounts without delinquency; (f) the Judge erred by finding Applicant has no cash reserves; (g)
the Judge erred by holding against Applicant the fact he borrowed money from his 401K plan to pay his debts; (h) the
Judge ignored evidence Applicant was taking corrective action to deal with his federal tax debt and his consumer debts; (i)
the Judge erred by finding Applicant made no payments toward his consumer delinquencies in the last year despite a 40%
increase in income over the previous year; (j) the Judge erred by finding Applicant had a monthly net positive remainder
of $400-$500; (k) the Judge erred by saying that it is unclear which debts of Applicant's might be discharged in
bankruptcy; and (l) the Judge ignored the fact Applicant had 20 years of no financial difficulties before his recent
difficulties arose due to a decrease in Applicant's income.  The Board's construes Applicant's arguments as raising the
issue of whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge
specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0350 (March 31, 1999) at p. 3.  Apart from that rebuttable
presumption, the Judge's detailed findings and conclusions in this show the Judge made a conscientious effort to consider
the record evidence in this case.  Nothing in the record persuades the Board that the Judge simply ignored record evidence
as claimed by Applicant.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the fact that the Administrative Judge did not make findings more favorable to Applicant does not
demonstrate the Judge ignored evidence favorable to Applicant.  The fact that the Judge did not find Applicant's evidence
demonstrated extenuation or mitigation of his financial problems sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance
decision is not proof that the Judge ignored the evidence presented by Applicant.  The Judge must weigh the evidence as a
whole (Directive, Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice
versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0394 (June 10, 1999) at p. 6.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of
the record evidence does not constitute proof that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious,
or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0448 (April 19, 1999) at p. 3.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0445 (April 2,
1999) at p. 2 ("Error is not demonstrated by [the appealing party's] ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the
record evidence.").  Accordingly, the fact that the Judge found Applicant's efforts to resolve his financial problems were
not sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance decisions does not prove that the Judge simply ignored Applicant's
efforts.</P>

<P>The Board need not agree with the Administrative Judge to conclude it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to
find that Applicant's actions mitigated the significance of his federal tax debt, but that Applicant's consumer debts were
not mitigated.  The decision sets forth an explanation for the Administrative Judge's different conclusions about
Applicant's federal tax debt on one hand and his consumer debts on the other hand.  That explanation reflects a plausible
interpretation of the record evidence and is not otherwise arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Implicit in Applicant's
appeal argument is the assumption that his consumer debts can easily be eliminated through discharge in a bankruptcy
proceeding.  As will be discussed later in this decision, the possibility of a future discharge in bankruptcy is not proof of
current reform and rehabilitation under Criterion F.  Furthermore, a discharge of Applicant's consumer debts in
bankruptcy would not have precluded the Judge from considering the security significance of Applicant's overall history
of financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0445 (April 2, 1999) at p. 3.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge specifically took into account the fact that Applicant's decline in income led to problems with
paying his consumer debts.  Reading the Judge's decision as a whole, the Judge had a rational basis for not giving that
mitigating evidence decisive or controlling weight in this case.</P>

<P>Considering the record as a whole, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for finding that Applicant was financially
overextended.  Even if the Board were to accept Applicant's argument and concluded the Judge erred by finding that
January1995 marked the turning point when Applicant became financially overextended, such an error would be harmless
in this case.  The Judge's overall analysis of Applicant's security eligibility does not stand or fall on her finding as to when
Applicant first became financially overextended.  Considering the record in this case, the Judge's overall analysis of
Applicant's financial problems is sustainable whether Applicant became financially overextended in 1995 or in 1996. 
Furthermore, the fact that Applicant closed various accounts without delinquency, and is current with some of his
accounts, did not preclude the Judge from considering the security significance of Applicant's failure to satisfy his
delinquent debts.</P>

<P>The Board does not find persuasive Applicant's contention that the Administrative Judge erred by holding against
Applicant the fact he borrowed money from his 401K plan to pay debts.  Applicant's contention focuses on two sentences
that appear in a lengthy discussion by the Judge of Applicant's efforts to deal with his consumer debts.  The Board reviews
a Judge's decision in its entirety, not just isolated sentences in the Judge's decision, to discern what the Judge found and
concluded.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0522 (May 1, 1997) at p. 3.  Considering the two sentences in context of the
Judge's overall analysis of Applicant's efforts to deal with his consumer debts, the Board concludes the Judge did not
commit legal error or act in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</P>

<P>Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's finding that "Applicant has made no payments toward any of his
consumer credit delinquencies in the last year, despite a 40% increase in income over 1997."  In support of that challenge,
Applicant makes two arguments: his 1997 income was lower than his 1996 income, and income for both of those years
was lower than his 1995 income; and the Judge failed to recognize Applicant had to spend a good portion of his money to
pay  an accountant and a lawyer.  Applicant's challenge is not persuasive.  The Judge's challenged finding pertains to
Applicant's income for the year ending in December 1998 (when the hearing was held), not for year 1997.  Furthermore, a
reading of the decision shows the Judge was aware that Applicant was using the services of an accountant and a lawyer. 
The Board will not assume the Judge was oblivious to the common sense fact that accountants and lawyers generally
expect to be paid for their services.</P>

<P>There is mixed merit to Applicant's contention that the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant had a
monthly net remainder of between $400 and $500.  The Judge's finding lacks some clarity because it appears in two
different portions of her decision, with the Judge using slightly different language each time to discuss the finding. 
Applicant's appeal argument cites to the second time the finding is discussed (Decision at p. 10), but does not cite to the
first time (Decision at p. 6), where the Judge notes some of Applicant's monthly net remainder was used to pay legal fees. 
Applicant refers the Board to page 132 of the hearing transcript in support of his appeal argument.  At the hearing,
Applicant was asked how much money he had left over each month.  A review of transcript page 132 shows there is some
ambiguity as to whether Applicant's answer referred to November 1998 only or a broader period of time.  Given the
ambiguity of the testimony on this point, the Judge's finding is questionable.  However, considering the Judge's decision
as a whole, this error is harmless and does not warrant remand or reversal.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0380 (March 8,
1999) at p. 4 (discussing harmless error doctrine).</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge did not err by stating that it is not clear what debts might be discharged if Applicant received a
discharge in bankruptcy.  The Judge is not required to speculate about which of Applicant's debts might be discharged <EM>if</EM>
he were to file for bankruptcy and <EM>if</EM> he were granted a discharge of his debts by a bankruptcy court.  And, in any event,
the possibility that Applicant might obtain a discharge of his credit card debts by a bankruptcy court at some future date
does not constitute evidence of rehabilitation or reform in the present.  <EM>Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 29, 1999) at p.
3 ("A stated intention to perform acts in the future does not constitute proof of a demonstrated track record of reform and
rehabilitation.").</P>

<P>Applicant's ability to handle his financial matters prior to his most recent problems constitutes evidence that is relevant
under the whole person concept of security clearance decisions.  However, that favorable evidence does not preclude the
Judge from considering the security significance of Applicant's recent history of financial problems.  Considering the
record as a whole, Applicant's prior favorable financial history did not preclude the Judge from concluding Applicant's
recent history of financial problems has negative security significance.  Under Criterion F, the security eligibility of an
applicant is placed into question when that applicant has a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring financial
difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0349 (February 3, 1999) at p. 4.  The overall facts and circumstances of
Applicant's delinquent consumer debts provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse formal findings under Criterion F
and her overall adverse security clearance decision.</P>
