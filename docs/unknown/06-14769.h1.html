<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) does not cite or refer to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, but it 
does cite DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the 
Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the same.  
The Regulation, paragraph C8.2.1 provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 12, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR 
detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on October 10, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case was 
assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 29, 2006.  At her hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary evidence (R. 
50, 64).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (R.)on December 14, 2006, and I received it on December 15, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to the evidence Applicant 
provided, and I admitted her additional evidence (Ex. K) on January 9, 2007. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the seven debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 42 years old.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  For the last ten years (except for the period November 2003 to October 2004 when she was unemployed), she has been employed by a United States government 
contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has a high school diploma and a diploma from a beauty school as well as one 
year of college.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>Applicant has never been married, and has two children (born in 1991 and 2002).<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>    </P> 
 
<P>In 1999, Applicant borrowed approximately $2,000 to pay for her sister's wedding based on family promises to assist her in repaying the loan (R. 17).  She made a few payments, however she and 
her family were unable to repay the loan.  Her mother became extremely ill in 2001.  In December 2001, her oldest daughter was hospitalized  for back surgery, and Applicant needed to take six 
weeks of unpaid leave from her employment (R. 17-18, 24).  While on this unpaid leave, she collected unemployment, but her income was reduced by about $450 (R. 25).  In 2002, she took two 
weeks of unpaid leave because she had to care for her father who had cancer (R. 26, 28).  Applicant left work in October 2003, and remained unemployed until her mother passed away on 
September 26, 2004 (R. 18, 28).  Her only income while unemployed was unemployment compensation (R. 28).  When she returned to work, she received a different position.  Her pay at her current 
position is  $7.36 per hour, whereas in 2004 she was receiving almost $10 per hour (R. 26).  In June of 2006, her four year old daughter was hospitalized for her tonsils and adenoids, and Applicant 
again took unpaid leave from work (R. 18, 23). She had to move out of her residence eight months ago because a relative was selling it.  Her move threw her finances into turmoil (R. 18).  For the 
last eight months she and her two daughters have been living with her father in her grandmother's house (R. 22). </P> 
 
<P>A personal financial statement (PFS) prepared in 2005<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> indicated her gross salary is $1,176 per month, and her deductions are $376 per month.  She listed monthly household expenses as follows: 
rent ($0), groceries ($240), clothing ($50), utilities ($350), car expenses ($75), and insurance ($70).  She did not list any debt payments or other liabilities. After deducting all expenses, she had a 
positive cash flow of $15 per month.  After completing her PFS, she purchased a 2003 Dodge Caravan.  Now she has a car payment of $299 per month, which causes her to have a negative cash 
flow (R. 41).  When necessary, her father provides additional money to her (R. 42). </P> 
 
<P>    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant plans to start working part time as a cosmetologist to gain additional income.  She had a license for cosmetology services, but her license lapsed two years ago (R. 44).  She will complete 
her remaining class for her cosmetologist license in early December 2006 (R. 44). She expects to receive her license around February 1, 2007, and begin working in a shop shortly thereafter (R. 45).  
She promised to make payments to resolve her delinquent debts (R. 43).  She contacted the creditors by telephone and informed them she wanted to make payments, but she has not sent them any 
correspondence or made any written promises (R. 47).  The following table provides the amount of each SOR debt and its current status.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The seven debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.g became delinquent between 1999 and 2004.  Six of the seven SOR debts have been 
delinquent for three or more years.  Applicant established that the debt in SOR &para; 1.g was settled and paid. It was delinquent for a thirty months. She has provided some evidence to dispute her 
responsibility for the debt in SOR &para; 1.b, and she will ask Medicare to pay the two SOR debts in &para;&para; 1.c and 1.f.  She currently has no legally enforceable, delinquent debts because the 3-year South 
Carolina statute of limitations is applicable to the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.f.          </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.g, which then became delinquent and remained 
delinquent for substantial periods of time. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a 
mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  Payment of the debt in SOR &para; 1.g on December 29, 2006, is simply too recent to merit application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all of her SOR debts because the debts became delinquent several years ago, and these delinquent debts were the result of her unemployment, and underemployment as 
well as her support to her mother, father, and children when they were ill.  This change in family circumstances is a good example of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, 
causing financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's control."  I conclude that Applicant's statement about how her debts became delinquent is credible and sufficient to provide 
some credit under FC MC 3 in regard to her debts.  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she waited until December 29, 2006, to pay the debt in SOR &para; 1.g.  There 
is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve her SOR debts for several years.  However, her recent resolution of the remaining SOR debt within the statute of limitations, 
and keeping her non-SOR debt payments current warrants some credit, which will be applied in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.    </P> 
 
<P>She is receiving financial counseling, and partial credit under FC MC 4 is warranted because there are clear indications (since December 29, 2006) that the problem is resolved and under control.  
She does not receive full credit under FC MC 4 because her track record of financial responsibility is too brief.  In regard to application of the statute of limitations, FC MC 6 does not apply because 
there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It should also be noted  in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, that the 3-year South 
Carolina statute of limitations is relevant to the seven debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.f.  <EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 (listing the statute of limitations for various debts).<A HREF="06-14769.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  In <EM>Carolina Marine

132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
42 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her unemployment, underemployment, and her care for her mother, 
father and her daughters.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the complete absence of new 
delinquent, unpaid debt over the last three years.  Moreover, potential increased income though her cosmetology employment shows signs of financial improvement in the future. </SPAN>The potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her recent debts, as her two car loans and two credit cards are current. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Greater awareness of financial responsibilities will 
result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances. Moreover, stability in her employment, increases in her income, and reduction in her debt load show improved self-discipline, 
and greater consciousness of her financial responsibilities.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006), the Board noted that two SOR debts were paid through judgment and garnishment, one SOR debt was paid through settlement, and one SOR 
debt was never paid.  Indeed for one SOR debt, the applicant did not even contact the creditor about payment.  Nevertheless, the applicant showed that he reduced his overall debt by 95% and the 
Board affirmed the decision to grant that applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial case is similar to ISCR Case No. 04-07360.  One SOR debt was paid on December 29, 2006.  One small SOR debt is disputed.  Two SOR debts may be paid by Medicare.  
Applicant's currently unpaid SOR debts are barred by South Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations.  As such, the concern about current financial pressure that may result in illegal activity is 
significantly lower because as a matter of law, she no longer has any delinquent debts.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and circumstances, in the context of 
the whole person, I conclude she has </SPAN>mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P>

that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a
