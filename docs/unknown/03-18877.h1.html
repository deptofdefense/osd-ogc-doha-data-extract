<P>Applicant is 39 years old, married with two teenage sons.  He works for a defense contractor as a computer image scanner operator.  Applicant was arrested in 
1995, 2000, and 2002 for driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was convicted of the 2002 offense, and of lesser offenses in the two earlier incidents.  
Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption security concern.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On August 3, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-18877.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 19, 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 
October 8, 2004.  On November 30, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 29, 2004, Applicant's attorney filed a motion to reopen the hearing or to submit new evidence.  Counsel attached seven documents or sets of 
documents that he now sought to have considered by me.  The Department Counsel objected in a response dated January 7, 2005, to the untimely filing of this 
motion, and also cited some of the documents were unsigned, or contained handwritten notations, or were not fully and properly identified.  Department 
Counsel objected also to the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine the Applicant on this new evidence.  An examination of the transcript shows Applicant did 
not request additional time to submit more exhibits.  Applicant's counsel stated he had no further evidence and rested his case (Tr. 112).  After careful 
consideration of the motion and response, the motion to reopen the hearing or submit additional documents is denied.  The tendered documents have been 
marked with the numbers listed in the Department Counsel's response and will be included in the file as appellate exhibits.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 39 years old, married with two sons 16 and 14 years of age, and works for a defense contractor.  Applicant works in the imaging and computer 
area.  His performance evaluations and character statements show him to be a competent and hard-working person.  Applicant received several company awards 
for good customer service to the Air Force with whom his employer has the contract.  He also submitted two letters of appreciation for his work on a retirement 
function in 1998 for another employee. (Tr. 17, 74-76; Exhibits 1, A-C, E-O, Q, R)</P> 
<P>On May 2, 1995, Applicant was arrested for DUI and carrying a concealed weapon in his Plymouth Horizon's glove compartment.  Applicant finished 
delivering pizzas about 11:30 p.m., closed the store, and about 1 a.m. drove to another town some distance away from his home to check out a bar that he heard 
advertised on the radio.  He wanted to play pool, but they did not have a table, so after 45 minutes he decided to leave.  He consumed alcohol to some extent 
great enough to be spelled on his clothing by the police later in the morning.  As he was leaving, he drove off the paved or graveled area of the parking lot into 
mud for some distance, and became stuck in the mud even with the front wheel drive of his vehicle.  He asked someone present in the parking lot to call a tow 
truck, and when a tow truck arrived so did the local police.  They asked him to take sobriety tests, and he refused because it was raining, he was cold, and the 
police had on rain gear he did not have.  He even refused to take the blood alcohol test later at the police station.  The police officers smelled alcohol on his 
clothing when he opened the car door.  The police found a pistol and ammunition in his car, he explaining the pistol as being protection for when he delivered 
pizzas in the bad areas of his delivery area.  He was arrested, he pled no contest to the DUI, was found guilty of reckless driving and fined $250 plus court costs.  
While Applicant now denies he drank that night, he admitted in his September 18, 1996, and his July 28, 2003, statements that he was drinking. (Tr. 20-26, 57, 
60, 77; Exhibits 3, 4, 11)</P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on June 21, 2000, for DUI.  He pled guilty to reckless operation and was fined $100.  Applicant had dinner about 10:30 p.m. that night, 
and one drink of scotch.  He then returned to work about midnight.  Between midnight and 4 a.m., he claims now his contact lenses needed adjustment, so he 
went to the bathroom to put saline solution in them.  Applicant described the bathroom as small.  Yet somehow he managed to fall over a wastebasket in the 
bathroom while allegedly putting saline solution in one eye.  He claims he knocked himself out when his head hit the floor.  He awoke, not knowing how long 
he had been knocked out, when the cleaning lady opened the bathroom door and hit his leg.  She departed and called the police about 4:30 a.m., who came to 
the office building as Applicant was leaving out the back door and driving away.  The police apprehended Applicant about two blocks away in his car.  They 
thought he was a breaking and entering suspect, and asked him to back up toward them with his shirt pulled up to demonstrate he had no weapons on him.  
They asked him to take a breath and sobriety test, but he was offended by their overbearing and aggressive attitude and behavior, so he refused.  He refused the 
tests a second time at the police station.  Applicant claimed he had a concussion, but had no medical evidence to support his assertion.  He did not consult with 
a physician until after the coached his son's baseball team later in the day.  His attorney later advised him to plead guilty to the reckless driving charge and pay 
the $100 fine, and he did so.  Applicant denies alcohol, either from the one drink at home at 10:30 p.m. or later drinking at the office or in a nearby bar, played 
any part in this incident.  Applicant apparently never made the 8 a.m. meeting he was allegedly preparing for when he was at his office overnight. (Tr. 27-37, 
62-64 78-83; Exhibits 7, 8, D)</P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on June 27, 2002, by a police department for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a seat belt violation, and a marked lane 
violation.  He pled no contest to DUI and was found guilty.  Applicant was fined $400, served three days in jail and had 177 days suspended if he successfully 
completed the three day weekend intervention program, got two years probation, and his drivers license was suspended for nine months.  Applicant was 
diagnosed to be alcohol dependent.  He remained alcohol abstinent for one year.  He did start drinking in the summer of 2004 after a tennis game with his 
brother-in-law.  He drank a Mike's Hard Lemonade.  The night he was arrested, sometime between 2 and 3 a.m. on his way home, he had a Long Island Iced 
Tea at a sports bar.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .107 with that one drink.  Applicant stated on his interrogatories that he drinks Mike's Hard 
Lemonade and Long Island Iced Tea, but only one type at a time now.  According to Applicant's testimony, the one Long Island Iced Tea led to his BAC of 
.107 in 2002, yet he continues to drink that concoction. (Tr. 38-45, 68, 84, 85, 96, 97, 110, 112; Exhibits 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10)</P> 
<P>Applicant was treated at the weekend intervention program (WIP) from February 6, 2003, to February 9, 2003.  He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and was 
recommended to an outpatient chemical dependence recovery program.  Applicant completed the program, and the probation from the court sentence.  
Applicant disputes the description of his alcohol relationship from the alcohol assessment, particularly that he had painful hangovers, episodic loss of 
consumption control, blackouts, or other unfavorable events or reactions resulting from alcohol consumption.  The staff at the WIP recommended Applicant 
have follow-on counseling with a specific counselor in his home area.  Applicant did have several counseling sessions with that person, but does not know that 
counselor's recommendations.  He spent time with the counselor from March 1, 2003 to March 18, 2003.  There is no record of that counselor's evaluation on 
the record.  He thinks he can drink responsibly now and does not have a problem with alcohol.  Applicant tried to distinguish being "out drinking" from going 
out to dinner with family or friends and having a drink then which he did not perceive as being "out drinking". (Tr. 43, 61, 66, 93-97; Exhibits 9, 10)</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by 
substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national 
security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 
12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption: <EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. E2.A7.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that Applicant was arrested in 1995, 2000, and 2002 for alcohol related offenses. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant consumed alcohol again in 2004 after 
a year's abstinence, and in fact he admits consuming the Long Island Iced Tea drink that led to his 2002 DUI arrest and conviction.  The WIP program 
evaluated Applicant as having an alcohol dependence, yet his self-perception is that he can drink alcohol with no adverse effects.  The history of his arrests and 
convictions belie that perception.  All this evidence shows that Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as 
driving while under the influence</EM>), DC E2.A7.1.2.4 (<EM>Evaluation of alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A major issue in this case is Applicant's credibility with his explanations of what happened in 1995 and 2000, and how the WIP staff misunderstood his 
situation.  He certainly downplays the role of alcohol in each of his arrests, to such a degree that now he denies drinking alcohol in the 1995 incident when his 
statements on September 18, 1996, and July 28, 2003, admit he drank alcohol that night.  I do not believe the local police would have confronted him at that 
time if he were merely stuck in the parking lot mud, and they had to have some reason other than to pull him out of the mud to appear that night.  I do not find 
Applicant credible on his explanations regarding this incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nor do I believe he fell down in the bathroom in 2000 merely because he was putting saline solution in his eye and tripped over a wastepaper basket.  His story 
about having a concussion, but not seeking medical attention until well after coaching his son's baseball team is not credible either.  His reasons for refusing the 
sobriety and BAC tests in 1995 and 2000 are puerile. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He also has an explanation for the WIP staff report designed to diminish its diagnosis, including now denying he had amnesia, "painful and severe hangovers", 
and episodic loss of consumption control and other comments he made in 2002.  I believe the contemporaneous statements the WIP staff recorded on the form 
that is an exhibit in this hearing.  I do not believe Applicant or his justifications and explanations now.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also tried to argue with the Department Counsel over the meaning of being "out drinking" (Tr. 61), seeking to establish a nuance that would put his 
actions in a favorable light.  I do not believe or find persuasive his distinctions.  It is a distinction without a difference. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, after the WIP diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and with three DUI arrests on his record, Applicant thinks he can drink alcohol responsibly, and 
resumes his drinking.  He comes to the hearing with no evidence from a professional alcohol treatment provider that someone with alcohol dependence and his 
driving record could safely resume drinking.  Applicant had ample time and opportunity to obtain witnesses, statements, or professional evaluations to support 
his assertions.  He did not do so, and I, based on the totality of the evidence, do not believe his self-diagnosis and justifications.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Consequently, I can find no Mitigating Conditions (MC) that apply here.  All the MC in fact are contrary to the facts of this case.  Therefore, based on this 
evidence, I conclude this guideline against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
