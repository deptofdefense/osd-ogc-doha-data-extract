<P>Applicant is 43 years old, married with three children, and works as a printer for a defense contractor.  Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996.  Since 
then, she has incurred four delinquent credit card accounts and an unpaid $56 power company judgment rendered in 1997.  Applicant failed to mitigate the 
financial considerations security concern.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 23, 2004, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-22684.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 24, 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 
January 13, 2005.  On April 21, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant was given until May 6, 2005, to 
submit additional documentation to support her contentions.  Applicant's counsel submitted a letter dated May 6, 2005, declining to submit additional evidence.  
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 9, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 43 years old, married, with three children.  She works as a printer in a facility that prints government materials, and for her job she is required to 
have a security clearance.  Applicant was divorced in 1996, and discharged her debts of $35,968 in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996.  Applicant's monthly post-tax income is $2,200, and that of her current husband is $3,600. (Tr. 11, 25, 35, 44, 47; Exhibits 1 and 2)</P> 
<P>Since 1996, Applicant has been married twice more, and resides with her current husband whom she married in 2002.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004.  
Applicant and her husband are both employed and own their own home.  They did not have to make a down payment on the home, and the mortgage payments 
are $538 monthly, benefitting from a state program for first-time homeowners.  They own two cars. (Tr. 11, 13, 14, 226-37; Exhibits 2, 3, 4) </P> 
<P>Applicant borrowed $4,000 so she and her husband could vacation at a southern gambling resort.  She pledged her vehicle as collateral for the loan.  They 
gambled away $1,000 of that loan.  Applicant has five credit cards, on which she currently owes about $4,000.  She makes minimum monthly payments of $25 
to $40, believing she is responsibly handling her debt with those payments.  The credit card debts are $500, $1500, $300, $500, and $1500, respectively.  She 
has other monthly expenses that she pays from the family income, and the net family income is about $1,300 to $1,800 monthly, depending on her husband's 
commission income.  From that net income she buys gas and groceries.  Applicant has a $2,000 Christmas loan from a loan company, and a $2,500 personal 
loan from another loan company.  Applicant currently owes about $13,000.  From her monthly net income Applicant saves $200 monthly for real estate taxes 
on her home, and $40 is deposited into a Christmas club at her bank.  The remaining net income use is not specified.  Applicant received a tax refund of $1,700 
for 2004 and $2,200 for 2003.  This money was spent on a bowling trip for her husband and other personal expenses.  She did not use any of these tax refunds 
or her net monthly income to pay off current loans faster.  Applicant pays 18% interest on her loans and credit card debts because of her credit history and 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 26-36, 46-57; Exhibits 2, 3, 4)</P> 
<P>Applicant has not paid the October 1997 $56 judgment from the local electric and gas power company.  That debt is delinquent.  Applicant claims she knew 
nothing about the judgment until the government investigator told her about it during the security clearance interview in April 2004.  Because she has power 
from that company now, she thought she owed nothing to it.  She is waiting for the company to collect from her instead of her paying the court judgment as she 
stated she would do in her April 2004 statement. (Tr. 17, 20, 21, 38-41; Exhibit 2)</P> 
<P>Applicant admits the existence of delinquent debts, including a bank credit card debt of $1,393 (account opened in June 1995), a credit card debt of $3,753 
(account opened in November 1997), a bank debt of $13,518 (account opened in May 1995), and a credit card debt of $2,769 (account opened in October 
2001).  She claims her current husband owes those debts, but they were opened prior to her marriage to him in 2002.  Applicant further claims she is not 
responsible for these debts, but they appear on her credit reports as her obligations.  Applicant wrote to the creditor of the $13,518 credit card debt, who 
responded to her that it would notify the credit reporting agencies that the debt should be removed from her credit profile, but does not state a reason for doing 
so.  The bankruptcy department of the credit card owner of the $3,753 debt wrote back to Applicant that this debt was not her obligation. (Tr. 15, 18, 21-23, 41, 
44, 59-66; Exhibits 2, 3, 4, A, and B)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See </EM>Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an 
applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 
00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: Guideline F:Financial Considerations: <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds. E2.A6.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR, except paragraph 1.d.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a 
history of financial mismanagement.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 to discharge $35,698 worth of debts.  She now owes another $13,000 on which 
she makes minimal monthly payments.  She has net income of about $1,000 monthly that could pay off all that debt in less than two years and still give her a 
sizeable savings account.  In the context of her financial ability to pay off loans from her net income, she has four delinquent debts.  The creditor's letter 
regarding the paragraph 1.d. $3,753 debt meets Applicant's burden of proof on that debt alone.  Her other exhibit on the $13,518 debt is not persuasive because 
the credit report entry could be deleted for other reasons than the debt was paid or the debtor was not obligated on the debt, and Applicant has not met her 
burden on that allegation.  Accordingly, I conclude the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable are DC 1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and 
DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant had no persuasive reason for not paying the $56.00 judgment.  She also attempted to transfer liability for the credit card debts to her 
husband and his bankruptcy.  But her conflicting testimony between first acknowledging  her liability, then trying to shift liability to her husband, finally 
testifying her name may have been on the cards but the cards were really her husbands, coupled with her April 2004 statement acknowledging the debts, when 
balanced against the credit report evidence, does not make Applicant credible.  I conclude these debts are hers and she should have repaid them before now, or 
make installment payment arrangements for these delinquent debts.  She did not do so.  Therefore, after considering all the evidence, I conclude there are no 
itigating Conditions (MC) applicable here.  I conclude this guideline against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
