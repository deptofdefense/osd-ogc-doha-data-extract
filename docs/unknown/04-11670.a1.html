<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to automated information systems in ADP-I and ADP-II sensitivity 
positions for Applicant.  On July 19, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns 
raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case 
be decided on the written record.  On February 14, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant's request for a 
trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-11670.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  It only contains new evidence, in the form of additional 
statements from the Applicant about her friends and family members in Russia, and three character reference letters.<A HREF="04-11670.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>   The Board cannot consider new 
evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is 
AFFIRMED.</SPAN></P>
