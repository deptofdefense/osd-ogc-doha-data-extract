<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial indebtedness remains delinquent and he has not made a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  His intentional falsifications on his security 
clearance application are a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony, and have not been mitigated.  His arrests in 1999 and 2001, have

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 31, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 7, 2004 and November 22, 2004, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written 
record in lieu of a hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), to the Applicant on June 7, 2005, consisting 
of nineteen Government Exhibits referred to in the record as Government Exhibits 1 through 19.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on June 13, 2005, and he submitted no  reply.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for decision on July 19, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the contents of the Form and the Applicant's reply to the FORM.  The Applicant 
is 32 years of age.  He is an Administrative Assistant for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense 
industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was on active duty in the Air Force for eight years and was assigned overseas.  During this time, he was young, married and had a child that he 
was required to support.  He was the  only working adult in the family.  They became overextended with too much debt and could no longer meet their financial 
obligations in a timely fashion.  At times the Applicant wrote checks when he did not have sufficient funds to do so.  On at least two occasions, formal 
complaints were filed against him by the creditors.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 13 and 16).  The Applicant indicates that while in the military he received 
financial counseling on several different occasions.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibits 10, 11 and 12).  The Applicant and his wife have divorced.  His ex-spouse filed 
bankruptcy leaving him with all of the debt from the marriage.  He states that he has since started contacting all three credit bureaus and has been paying off 
debt.  He is living at home with his mother and she is not charging him any rent. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR sets forth approximately twenty-three delinquent debts totaling about $32,000 allegedly owed by the Applicant.  The Applicant admits to twelve of 
the delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1.a., 1.b.,1.d., 1e., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.n., 1.s., 1.t., 1.z., and 1.aa., totaling approximately $12,180.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's 
Answer to SOR).  The remaining debts he denies, claiming that the debts were not his and are not his responsibility, or they are beyond the statute of 
limitations.  He denies all of the other delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 9 and Applicant's Answer to the SOR).  Credit reports 
of the Applicant indicate that all twenty-five debts set forth in the SOR are delinquent and owing.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 7 and 8).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has provided no documentary evidence of any kind to show that he is paying his past due creditors.  It is unclear from the record who, when and 
how, he will satisfy his past due debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated July 25, 2002.  Question 26 of the application asked the Applicant if in 
the last seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25.  The Applicant answered, 
"NO."  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 6).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested in March 1999 and charged with Alleged 
Threats/Resisting Apprehension and in March 2002 for Second Degree Assault.  The Applicant states that he was advised that none of his criminal offenses 
were on his criminal record and so he did not list them.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same application, at question 37, asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he has had any judgments against him that have not been paid.  The 
Applicant answered, "NO."  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose a judgment issued against him in 
November 1995 and another in June 2001.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 7 and 8).  The Applicant claims that these judgments occurred over seven years ago and 
therefore he did not list them.  This argument can be made with respect to the judgment entered against hin in November 1995, but not the one in June 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same application, at question 38 asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he has ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant 
answered, "YES," and listed one debt for $4,000 owed to a bank.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  This was not all or even close to being accurate.  The<EM> </EM>Applicant 
failed to list his twenty four other delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Applicant claims that these debts were all incurred over seven years ago and 
therefore he did not list them.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant knew or should have known to reveal the truth about his criminal record and his history of delinquent debts.  The fact that he did not 
indicates that he was simply not being truthful at the time he completed the security clearance application. He obviously did not take the process of filing out 
the application seriously and it shows.  Except for his failure to list the judgment entered against him in November 1995, I find that the Applicant deliberately 
attempted to conceal his delinquent financial history from the Government on his security clearance application.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's deliberate falsifications on his security clearance application, discussed above, are a violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 
1001, a felony. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested on March 6,1999, and charged with Alleged Threats/Resisting Apprehension.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 18).  He was placed in 
counseling.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He was also arrested on March 27, 2002, and charged with Second Degree Assault.  He pled no contest and was ordered to take an Anger Management Class 
and sentenced to one year of probation.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 15 and19).  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P>

statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility, dishonesty and criminal conduct which demonstrates poor judgment or 
unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F); and he has been untruthful 
on his security clearance application (Guideline E); in violation of a criminal statute (Guideline J).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and 
untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his 
security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is noted that the Applicant has gone through a divorce and was left with the debts from the marriage.  However, this does not appear to be the real problem as 
to why the Applicant has not paid his bills.  He states that he has contacted his creditors and is paying his debts, however, he presents no documentary evidence 
to support this.  He has presented no evidence to show that he has made or is making a good faith effort to pay off his past due creditors or resolve his financial 
indebtedness. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has learned how to properly manage his financial affairs.  With respect 
to his finances, the Applicant has admitted in excess of $12,000.00 in delinquent debt.  His credit reports show in excess of $32,000.00 in delinquent debt.  To 
his credit, the Applicant has moved into his mother's home and is not paying rent.  This should allow him more money to pay his delinquent debts.  Upon 
review of his financial statement,  it appears that he has a remainder at the end of the month that could be used to pay his delinquent debts, but he has failed to 
demonstrate that he has done anything at all.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  All of the debts remain owing, and he remains heavily indebted.  
Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations </EM>and <EM>(3) Inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts </EM>apply.  None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply.  His financial problems remain current, (MC)1; they are not isolated, (MC) 2; and the 
Applicant has not initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC) 3<EM>.</EM>  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guidelines E and J, the Applicant has presented no reasonable excuse as to why he did not reveal his criminal record and his delinquent 
financial history in response to questions 26, 37 and 38 on his security clearance application.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no 
reasonable excuse for his failure to answer the questions truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been completely honest with 
the Government regarding his criminal and financial history and he sought to conceal the truth.  Disqualifying Condition<EM> (2) The deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities </EM>applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the 
Government and that he violated a Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Applicant has been arrested on two separate occasions for criminal conduct in 1999 and 2002<EM>.  </EM>Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) Allegations or 
admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM> and <EM>(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>both apply.  
None of the mitigating factors apply.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guidelines E and J.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.     </SPAN></P>
