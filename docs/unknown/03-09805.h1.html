<P>Security concerns remain over Applicant's criminal conduct in 1998 and 2001 and over his personal conduct in failing to disclose his 1998 arrest for Simple 
Battery on his 2000 security clearance application.  While he completed anger management in 2001, that alone is insufficient to establish clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 21, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-09805.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 1 and over personal conduct (Guideline E) in 
paragraph 2. Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on December 5, 2004, and requested a decision without a hearing.</P> 
<P>On March 14, 2004, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was forwarded to Applicant on March 16, 2004, where he was 
advised he had an opportunity to review the form, but needed to respond within 30 days of receipt of the letter.  Department Counsel made a Motion to Amend 
the SOR to conform to the evidence by substituting "transmitted by you on July 15, 2000" for "executed by you on June 2, 2000" in allegation 2.a. concerning 
his security clearance application.  As Applicant submitted no objection, this motion to amend the SOR is granted.</P> 
<P>Applicant received the FORM on March 21, 2005; so his response was due on April 20, 2005. He submitted no response. On May 18, 2005, the matter was 
assigned to me.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P>Applicant, 32 years old, has been employed by Company #1, a defense contractor in State #1, since June 1998.  He completed and signed a Security Clearance 
Application (SF 86) on June 2, 2000, which was transmitted on July 15, 2000.  (Items 4, 5)</P> 
<P>Applicant received a BA in 1997 from a college in State #2.  He married in February 2000; they have a child born in February 1998.  He has a stepchild born in 
April 1993.  (Items 4, 5)  He has a third daughter reported to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in a March 6, 2002, Statement.  (Item 6)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG> <STRONG>and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's SF 86 documents that he disclosed in answer to Question 21 that he had a felony arrest in February 1997 for Lewd or Lascivious act; however the 
charges were dropped and the file expunged in State #1.  In response to Question 26, Your Police Record - Other Offenses, he disclosed two earlier arrests-- a 
ay 1995 arrest for Trespassing where he pled nolo contendere and paid $130 in fines and a November 1994 arrest for "Disorderly/Resist.Nonviolent" with a 
deferred prosecution agreement where he paid a $150 fine and was ordered to have no violent contact with the victim.   (Items 2, 5, 6) </P> 
<P>During the security clearance investigation a Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI) records check obtained in May 2001 also documented the 1997 felony arrest 
Applicant had reported.  (Item 7)  However, also documented in the FBI report was another arrest in November 1998 for Battery, a first degree misdemeanor, 
that Applicant failed to disclose in response to Question 26.  (Items 5, 7, 8)  The FBI report also documented a second arrest for Battery, a first degree 
misdemeanor,  in April 2001, which occurred after he submitted his SF 86.  The arrest record reports that in 2001 Applicant hit his wife in the stomach in front 
of their three-year-old daughter.  His wife reported that at a ball game Applicant got angry and took a hot dog and smashed it in her face and when they got 
home he pinned her in a corner in the kitchen and hit her twice in the stomach.  Applicant only admitted that he earlier got into an argument with his wife and 
threw a hot dog at her and shoved her. (Items 7, 9)   The eldest daughter called 911.  He was arrested and issued a no contact order which his wife later had 
lifted after he completed  Anger Management/Power and Control classes in May 2001.  (Items 1, 2, 6)  In January 2002 adjudication was withheld, he was 
sentenced to two days in jail, and awarded one year of probation with early termination after six months.  (Items 1, 2)   Applicant asserts that he "successfully 
embraced the concepts and ideas of the classes"; however, he submitted no additional evidence, such as letters of reference, to support this assertion. (Item 2)</P> 
<P>Applicant admits he failed to list the 1998 arrest on his SF 86.  (Item 2)  However, his assertion that the omission was not deliberate because he voluntarily 
revealed a 1997 felony arrest  that was sealed is not credible as he has a duty to disclose all arrests.  Further his claim that he subsequently provided correct 
information voluntarily is not credible as he provided no evidence to support this claim.  Indeed his March 2002 Statement to DSS disclosed no details about 
the 1998 arrest.   In June 2000 Applicant signed a copy of the SF 86 and certified that his statements were "true, complete, and correct" and that a "knowing and 
willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment of both. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code)."  (Item 4)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>The Concern</EM>:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>The Concern</EM>:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's multiple misdemeanor criminal incidents in 1994, 1995, 1998, and 2001 in State #1 and his 1997 felony arrest which was sealed and expunged all 
raise security concerns over this criminal conduct.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: E2.A10.1.2.2.: A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.   In the most recent incident in 2001 Applicant showed his anger at a ball game by  taking a hot dog and smashing it in 
his wife's face.  When they got home he pinned her in a corner in the kitchen and hit her twice in the stomach.  One of the children call 911 which led to his 
arrest for Battery-Domestic Violence.  In January 2002 adjudication was withheld; he was sentenced to two days in jail, awarded one year of probation with 
early termination after six months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the 1994 and 1995 charges may be mitigated<A HREF="03-09805.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> because of the passage of time, the 1998 and 2001 battery charges are recent and remain a security concern 
because of his demonstrated poor judgment.  While he did complete an anger management course in 2001, he provided no additional evidence of his 
rehabilitation.  Thus, he fell short of meeting the high standard that  "There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, after considering the E2.2. Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c., but 
against him on subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e. under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant did reveal his 1995 arrest on his SF 86 form, he failed to disclose other adverse information, his 1998 arrest for Simple Battery, which led 
the Government to raise security concerns over personal conduct issues under Disqualifying Conditions<A HREF="03-09805.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> (DC) (2).  Applicant's omission of relevant and 
material information could reflect questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could 
indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information.  Applicant had a duty to reveal the adverse information requested in Questions 26 about his 
1998 arrest for Simple Battery. His failure to do so demonstrates that he put his personal interests ahead of the government's interests.   He signed and certified 
his security clearance application was "true, completed, and correct" when it was not.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, Applicat fails to meet the mitigation<A HREF="03-09805.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> guidelines.  While Applicant claimed as a defense that he voluntarily disclosed this arrest to the DSS agent in his 
interview, the DSS statement included  no such voluntary disclosure.  So he was failed to establish this mitigation condition.  Also, he failed to offer any other 
evidence, beside his claim that he did not omit deliberately, to mitigate these concerns.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule against Applicant under SOR Paragraph 2 under subparagraphs 2.a.    </SPAN></P>
