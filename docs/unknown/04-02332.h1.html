<P>Applicant used marijuana 25-30 times in social situations over a six-year period, but voluntarily stopped using marijuana in December 2002.  He fully disclosed 
his marijuana use on his security clearance application (SF 86).  He is not psychologically or physically addicted.  He has changed his lifestyle and is 
determined to not abuse any controlled substances in the future.  He has mitigated the security concern based on drug involvement.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision 
to deny Applicant a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 12, 2005, admitted the allegations, offered explanations, and did not request a hearing.  At some time after May 
12, 2005, Applicant retained counsel.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 9, 2005, he requested a hearing.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant's counsel submitted an undated supplement to the answer to the 
SOR, again admitting the allegations and offering explanations and mitigating evidence.  The case was assigned to an administrative judge on January 6, 2006, 
and reassigned to me on February 6, 2006, based on workload.  On February 13, 2006, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for March 28, 2006.  
The case was heard as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old senior scientist for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since May 1998.  He has held a security clearance 
since April 1993.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant spent 10 years as an undergraduate before obtaining a degree.  He majored in mathematics with a minor in physics, but he took a number of unrelated 
courses in Russian, economics, history, and philosophy.  While an undergraduate, he did independent research in comparative history and economic 
development, traveled overseas, ran a computer training center in Africa for two years, and lived in Africa for an additional year studying education finance 
reform.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married in April 1998 and was divorced in February 2005.  No children were born during this marriage.  He and his ex-wife decided not to have 
children, and they spent their leisure time going out with friends, partying, bar hopping, and attending music-related events.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's marijuana use was always event-related.  He used it with friends at music festivals, concerts, New Year's Eve, birthdays, and similar events.  He 
estimated he used it five or six times a year until he used it for the last time on New Year's Eve in 2002.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He felt no peer pressure to use marijuana but used it 
simply because it was pleasurable.  That lifestyle became "less satisfying over time," causing Applicant to terminate his marriage, find new friends, and change 
his lifestyle.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He has no desire to resume his marijuana use.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He is now engaged and living with a woman who has three children (ages 8, 9, and 12) from a 
previous relationship.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Instead of spending his leisure time frequenting bars and attending music festivals, he spends it on soccer, Little League baseball, and 
family life.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Although he occasionally sees his old friends, they "don't hang out together anymore," because he doesn't have time for "that stuff" anymore.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a SF 86 on September 16, 2003, in order to obtain a higher level of clearance and take on more responsibilities with his company.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  In his 
SF 86, he disclosed using marijuana 25-30 times between August 1996 and December 2002, while he held a security clearance.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  After he completed his SF 86, 
his security officer realized he had never executed the company's "drug statement," acknowledging his awareness that unlawful use of drugs was a basis for 
denial or loss of a security clearance.  The security officer had Applicant execute a "drug statement" shortly after he executed the SF 86.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The security officer 
had the impression it was the first time Applicant realized his marijuana use was irresponsible and would not be condoned in the future.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Notwithstanding 
Applicant's previous marijuana use, his security officer regards him as "a model employee with good moral character."<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance because he believed the risk of detection was low and he was not working on classified projects.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  
The execution of the SF 86 had a "forcing function," because he had to answer the question about drug use.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  When asked if he would disclose his marijuana 
use if he "had it all to do over again," he responded that he would make the disclosure, because the alternative of living with the lie and the potential 
ramifications of the lie would be worse.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received outstanding performance appraisals for 2003 and 2004, and he received substantial pay raises based on his performance and increased level 
of responsibility.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  The president of his company regards him as an exemplary and highly respected employee, with a reputation for being honest, trustworthy, 
reliable, hard-working, and conscientious.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Two government officials who have worked with Applicant submitted affidavits stating they were aware of his 
previous marijuana use but regard him as honest, candid, conscientious, extremely intelligent, and "of incalculable value" to their projects.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2005, July 2005, January 2006, and March  2006, Applicant was randomly tested for use marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and 
phencyclidine, and he tested negative for all the substances on each occasion.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Because of his admission of previous marijuana use, he was tested more 
frequently than other employees.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2005, Applicant voluntarily underwent a polygraph examination in which he was questioned about his marijuana use.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  In the same month, he was 
jointly evaluated by a forensic psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist.  The evaluators concluded Applicant had "no problems in the following areas: alcohol or 
drug dependence or addiction vulnerability; unusual thoughts or peculiar experiences, antisocial behavior; problems with empathy; undue  suspiciousness or 
hostility; moodiness or impulsivity; unhappiness and depression, unusually elevated mood or heightened activity; marked anxiety; problematic behavior used to 
manage anxiety, or difficulties with health or physical functioning."  They concluded he was "a psychologically sound man with very good moral and ethical 
standards," with "no psychiatric diagnosis or substance abuse disorder."<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The psychiatrist testified Applicant's marijuana use was "social usage, not a dependence problem."  Accordingly, he and the psychologist concluded no formal 
rehabilitative treatment was necessary.<A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  The psychiatrist believes marijuana use is now "anachronistic in his life," because Applicant has moved away from his 
college lifestyle, assumed more professional responsibility, married a woman with three children, and is committed to being a father figure for his family. <A HREF="04-02332.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1. through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1. through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in persons with access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline H, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A8.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Any illegal use of a controlled substance can raise a security concern and may be a disqualifying condition (DC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A8.2.1.  Illegal 
drug possession also is a disqualifying condition (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A8.2.2.  Applicant's admitted possession and use of marijuana establish DC 1 and DC 
2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns based on possession and use of marijuana can be mitigated (MC 1) by showing it was not recent.  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.3.1.  There are no 
"bright line" rules for determining when conduct is "recent."  The determination must be based "on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the 
parameters set by the directive."  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without 
any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates "changed circumstances or conduct 
sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation."  <EM>Id</EM>.  As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not used marijuana for 39 months.  His awakening 
occurred when he was faced with honestly executing his SF 86 and confronted by his security officer about the implications of illegal marijuana use.  He ended 
a sterile marriage, and is involved in a new family-oriented relationship.  He changed his lifestyle, substituting soccer, Little League, and family life for bar 
hopping and smoking marijuana at music festivals.  He no longer associates on a regular basis with his marijuana-using friends.  After drifting through 10 years 
of college life and young adulthood, he realized he needed to grow up and change his lifestyle.  He has moved to more responsible positions in his company and 
finally realizes the importance of maintaining the trust of his employer, clients, and the U.S. government.  I conclude MC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated (MC 2) by evidence of a "demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future."  Directive &para; 
E2.A8.1.3.3.  "Only with the passage of time will there be a track record that shows whether a person, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to adhere 
to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the person has acted in the past."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 3, 1998). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has stated his intent not to abuse drugs.  He has demonstrated his intent by changing his lifestyle, changing his circle of friends, and 
not using marijuana for more than 39 months.  At the hearing, he impressed me as open, honest, and sincere.  I conclude MC 2 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated (MC 4) by evidence of "[s]atisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional."  Directive &para; 
E2.A8.1.3.4.  Applicant did not undergo formal rehabilitation and aftercare, because the psychiatrist and psychologist who evaluated him determined none was 
needed.  He has not had a recurrence of abuse for more than 39 months, and he received a favorable prognosis from the two credentialed medical professionals 
who evaluated him.  Because Applicant has not completed any formal rehabilitation program, I conclude MC 4 is only partially established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the general adjudicative guidelines, I have considered that Applicant's marijuana use while holding a security clearance was a criminal offense and a 
serious breach of trust.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.1.  His marijuana use was relatively frequent for about six years, but is not recent.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.3.  His 
marijuana use occurred when he was in his 30's, but at that time his level of judgment and maturity was well below his chronological age.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.4.  
He has accepted responsibility for his conduct, changed his lifestyle, and refrained from future drug abuse.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.6.  Because of his decision to 
fully disclose his past marijuana use, he has eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.8.  In light of all the 
changes in his lifestyle and his demonstration of belated maturity, I believe the likelihood of recurrence is low.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.9.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concern based on drug involvement.</SPAN></P>
