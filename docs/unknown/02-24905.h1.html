<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In a sworn, written answer, dated September 22, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations
set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. 
Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on February 18, 2004.  A complete
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded, until
March 30, 2004, an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or
mitigation.  No further response was made.  The case was assigned to me May 14, 2004.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has admitted two of the factual allegations (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c.) pertaining
to drug involvement under Guideline H.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of
fact.  He denied the factual allegation in subparagraph 1.b. and ignored the conclusory allegation in
subparagraph 1.d.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a
SECRET security clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a substance abuser whose illegal substance of choice is marijuana.  He
commenced using marijuana in his early teens while in high school<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and continued using it, with
varying frequency, until at least May 2002,<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> when he was interviewed by a special agent of DSS. 
His marijuana abuse occurred with no set pattern, but generally took place "when it was around" at
parties, clubs, concerts, and festivals.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He smoked marijuana in cigarettes, pipes, and bongs.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  When
asked to quantify his marijuana use Applicant indicated his average use over the years would be
monthly.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant's marijuana use is "common knowledge among [his] social group."<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant admitted to a DSS agent during a subject interview purchasing marijuana in the
past, but he had not done so in over one year.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant now denies making those admissions and
claims he never purchased marijuana.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Considering the nature of Applicant's openness regarding
his marijuana use and future intentions, I chose to give greater weight to his position in this regard
than the unsworn recollections of the DSS agent.  Accordingly, Applicant did not purchase marijuana
during his period of marijuana use.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has never sought, been referred to, nor received any treatment or counseling for
his use of marijuana or any other illegal substance.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He has never been diagnosed as a substance
abuser or substance dependent by a credentialed medical professional.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, he has never
been arrested for any illegal substance abuse-related conduct.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's motivation for using marijuana is that it makes him feel relaxed and does not
cause adverse behavioral effects.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He enjoys smoking marijuana and has no intentions of stopping
its use.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  At the same time, he has no "specific" intentions of continuing his marijuana use, although
he might do so when the opportunity presents itself in the context of his normal social activities.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant challenges the legal status of marijuana use and possession.  He contends there is
no law against smoking marijuana, and he knows of only the prohibition against possessing the
substance.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Applicant maintains his employer would not have a problem with his marijuana use and
he does not care if he receives a security clearance.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant was married in 1987, and has two children.  He divorced in 1994.  He received a
bachelor of science degree in an unspecified discipline in 1990.<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has been employed by his current employer, a government contractor, since March
1983, and presently serves as a customer service engineer.  The quality of his performance has not
been developed in the record.</P>

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each
guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding
whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information
(Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules
of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied
in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,
Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and
impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
"whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative
Process factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at
the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative
guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>	Guideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises
questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk
of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and
discussed in the Conclusions section below.<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation
of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as Mandated by the Floyd D.
Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provides policy
guidance for the implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a new
section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the
Department of Defense under specific circumstances.  The situation described above involves one
of those specific circumstances.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>			The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or
employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or
member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps on active
duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance
or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information and
who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the
statute:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>			(1) has been convicted in any court of the United
States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for
a term exceeding one year;</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>			(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a
controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>			(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a
mental health professional approved by the
Department of Defense; or</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>			(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed
Forces under dishonorable conditions.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military
Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions concerning convictions,
dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."  The waiver
authority does not apply to current substance abuse or mental incompetence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates that provision 2, described
above, "does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guidelines relative to current drug
involvement.  Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance
is not considered eligible for a security clearance."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the issuance of the clearance is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-24905.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."
For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are
one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,
logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the
government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified
information.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the
applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism
are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any
express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal
precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following
with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The government has established its case under Guideline H.  Applicant's improper and illegal
drug abuse, consisting of the possession and use of marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of
his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The Directive clearly expresses the government's
concern regarding drug involvement in provision E2.A8.1.1.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>improper or illegal involvement with
drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified
information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing
the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information</EM>).  Drug abuse is defined in provision
E2.A8.1.1.3.: (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from
approved medical direction</EM>).  Provision E2.A8.1.1.2.1. generally identifies and defines drugs:
(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances
Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and
hallucinogens</EM>)).  Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls
within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>any drug abuse</EM>), and DI
DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,
sale, or distribution</EM>).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant did not simply experiment, while a teenager, out of curiosity, and then quit. 
Rather, he commenced using marijuana while in his early teens, notwithstanding the illegal nature
of his endeavor.  He exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature
behavior, and continued his substance abuse of marijuana over the years until at least May 2002--the
same month he was interviewed by DSS.  Based on his May 2002 verbal admissions, it is also
probable the substance abuse has not yet ceased.  Applicant is now 41-years-old, and he last claimed
to have no intentions of stopping his use of marijuana as recently as September 2003, in response
to the SOR.  Applicant did not concede that drug use violates the law, but only that drug possession
is a violation.  In light of his comments regarding future intentions, I construe Applicant's position
in this regard as follows: he sees nothing wrong with using marijuana and may continue to do so if
the opportunity--a party, club, concert, or festival--presents itself.  Applicant's position, in the
absence of a clear and unambiguous expressed intent to discontinue substance abuse, falls within DI
DC E2.A8.1.2.5. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a
credentialed medical professional.  Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of
a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in
an unfavorable determination</EM>).  As stated above, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises
questions regarding this individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.
Applicant's words and actions have created no doubt over his unwillingness to discontinue illegal
marijuana use.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes are
significant factors in the overall adjudicative process.  Despite a lengthy period of substance abuse,
Applicant has not undergone any drug awareness, education, or treatment program, in order to
achieve a better self-understanding of the behavioral and psychological effects of his actions and the
motivation therefor.  While there is no requirement to undergo treatment or attend any of the
aforementioned programs, exposure to at least the educational and psychological components of
those programs might be beneficial to Applicant.  Likewise, simply claiming that enjoyment and
relaxation without adverse behavioral effects are motivators, does not demonstrate true insight into
the actual motivation for the course of conduct which he had chosen and continues to follow.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's continuing drug involvement also falls within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  He refuses to
state unequivocally that he will no longer use marijuana in the future and has, instead, displayed a
somewhat cavalier attitude towards illegal substance use and the necessity of his obtaining a security
clearance.  Under these circumstances, based on the law, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM>
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under
the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the
Directive, Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case.  The evidence leaves
me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. 
Accordingly, allegations 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.  On the
other hand, the government has failed to establish its case pertaining to allegation 1.b. of the SOR
and it is concluded in favor of Applicant.  Consequently, under Guideline H and 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986,
I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified
information.</SPAN></P>
