<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In 2000, Applicant incurred debt from a failed business venture. By September 2004, there were three delinquent liabilities totaling approximately $22,547.00. 
He had two judgments  also stemming from the business, which he satisfied between 2001 and 2004. He settled the three delinquent debts in September 2005. 
He has mitigated the security concerns under the Financial Considerations guideline. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On September 16, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> under Department of 
Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (the Regulation); Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, (Directive); a memorandum from 
the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004; and a 
memorandum from the Deputy Director for Personnel Security, office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and 
Intelligence, dated August 4, 1999.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline F (financial considerations), why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III 
to support a contract with the Department of Defense. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether such eligibility should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On October 7, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the government's written case on March 15, 2006. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on March 21, 2006, and 
was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant submitted a written 
response to the FORM on April 14, 2006. This case was assigned to another administrative judge on April 28, 2006, but reassigned to me on May 12, 2006, 
because of caseload considerations.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the 
record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a single, 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor, seeking an Information Systems Position. He has been with his current employer since 
January 2000, serving as a customer service supervisor for a pharmacy benefits provider.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He submitted an application for a position of trust in connection 
with his employment in April 2004.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Prior to his current employment, Applicant and a business partner opened a gourmet coffee company in 1997. His partner owned 51% of the business, and he 
owned 49%. He advanced the initial costs for supplies and equipment for the business venture because his partner did not have any credit. However, the 
business did not produce sufficient revenue to stay open or pay the costs advanced by him. The business ended in 2000, and the partners each went their own 
way. Because he charged the start-up business costs on his credit cards, Applicant had the sole responsibility for these debts. Prior to this time, his credit rating 
was good.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>By July 2000, he had three delinquent liabilities totaling approximately $22,547.00, which were either past due, charged off as bad debts, or placed for 
collection. He indicated that he was unable to pay any of the bills and did not want to file for bankruptcy. Instead, he wanted to save his money and pay all the 
delinquent bills at one time. During that time he also paid his own credit card accounts.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR identified three delinquent accounts. Those accounts, and their current status, are described below:<BR>

<BR> 
 
<P>Although Applicant did not pay or settle his three delinquent accounts from the failed business venture (listed in the SOR) until 2005, he did pay in full his two 
other accounts that are mentioned as judgments in his 2005 credit report. An accounting firm 2004 judgment of $8,092.00 was paid in full on July 19, 2004. 
The credit card business account judgment in the amount of $5,813.00 was paid in 2001.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> <BR>

professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United  States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR>

<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="05-03808.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegation set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline F. In 2000 or 2001, Applicant incurred debt from a failed business venture. By September 2004, there 
were three delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,547.00. This gives rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. 
(history of not meeting financial obligations); and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's debts resulted from a failed business, which bring this matter within FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>He chose not to file bankruptcy in 2000, instead he paid some debt in 2001 and 2004, and the remaining three debts in 2005. Thus, not only the three delinquent 
debts listed in the SOR, but two judgments that resulted from the unsuccessful business are resolved. None of the debts were due to excessive personal 
spending. Because his business partner did not contribute to the payments, Applicant assumed full responsibility for the delinquent debts. This shows 
motivation and a good-faith effort to pay the debt. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts) applies in this case.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Finally, I considered the whole person concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I balanced all the factual 
circumstances and applied them to the adjudicative criteria established in the Regulation in light of the whole person concept. Under these circumstances, 
Applicant has mitigated the government's case. Allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR under Guideline F are concluded in favor of Applicant. Accordingly, I 
conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a trustworthiness determination to Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG><BR>
