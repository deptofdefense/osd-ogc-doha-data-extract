<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July 26, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
(SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), pursuant to Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 30, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge 
Katherine Moen Braeman granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's favorable clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to 
law.</P> 
 
<P> Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge erred in her application of Guideline B Disqualifying Condition 3,<A HREF="04-12363.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Guideline B Mitigating 
Condition 1,<A HREF="04-12363.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and the whole person factors.<A HREF="04-12363.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel's argument has mixed merit. </P> 
 
<P>Given the record in this case, the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Disqualifying Condition 3 and in favorably applying Mitigating Condition 1.  
However, those errors are harmless under the unusual facts and circumstances of this case because the Judge found that Applicant's circumstances raised 
security concerns under Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="04-12363.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 6,<A HREF="04-12363.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and the Judge did not rely heavily on Mitigating Condition 1 in reaching her ultimate security 
clearance decision.  Absent the applicability of that Mitigating Condition 1, it is clear that the Judge would have reached the same result based upon the record 
as a whole.  Therefore, the continued viability of the Judge's favorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility under Guideline B turns on whether 
the Judge articulated a rational basis for those favorable conclusions that is consistent with the record evidence and with a whole person analysis.  <EM>See, e.g., 
</EM>ISCR Case No. 03-04300 at p. 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006).</P> 
 
<P>In her whole person analysis in this case, the Administrative Judge relied on numerous unchallenged findings of facts which cumulatively support the Judge's 
ultimate conclusion that Applicant has sufficiently strong ties to the United States to overcome the government's security concerns.  Applicant has been a 
naturalized U.S. citizen since 1998.  His immediate family members (wife, child, mother, sister and two brothers) are legally located in the U.S., as are all of his 
financial ties.  Applicant is a member an ethnic group that suffered under the Taliban, and he and his family are supportive of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.  
Applicant has not sought to continue any ties to Afghanistan except to use his expertise as a translator to advance the interests of the U.S.  Two Americans in 
Afghanistan provided evidence for Applicant including a credible U.S. government official who viewed Applicant as invaluable in the war on terrorism in 
Afghanistan, and noted that Applicant had participated in interrogations of the Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) and gathered information from ACM detainees 
which developed a greater understanding of ACM activities to further support U.S. operations.  Applicant was careful to follow all security guidelines while in 
Afghanistan.  He did not tell his family where he was working in Afghanistan in order to comply with security regulations, and he did not attend his father's 
funeral in Afghanistan because his priority was maintaining his security clearance.  </P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge also found, based upon the government's evidence, that Afghanistan had made great strides towards building democracy and 
rebuilding the country, that it had embraced democracy and pluralism in the context of Afghan and Islamic traditions, and that it had reversed its long history of 
serious human rights abuses under the previous regime.  There were no findings that the government of Afghanistan possesses an aggressive or hostile 
intelligence/security profile <EM>vis-a-vis</EM> the U.S., or is otherwise engaged in efforts to acquire classified or sensitive economic information from the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>Accordingly, in this case, the Administrative Judge has articulated a detailed, rational explanation for her favorable determination under the whole person 
concept.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's whole person analysis to conclude that it is sustainable.    </P>
