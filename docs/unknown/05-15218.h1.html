<P>Applicant has one unpaid debt that was incurred as a result of  medical treatment that he received for an injury he suffered  in 1998, when he was 19 years old.  Because of unemployment or 
underemployment, he has been unable to pay off this debt until recently. The creditor now will not accept payment for this debt and shows that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> owes nothing. Since 1998<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, when Applicant</SPAN> 
incurred that debt, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he</SPAN> has been and remains current on all his other debts, and he has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On March 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 20</SPAN>, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">June 29</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on </SPAN>June 29<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, and the 
hearing was held on </SPAN>July 18<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 5), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered two documentary exhibits, (Applicant 
Exhibits A and B), and offered his own testimony. </SPAN>The record was held open to allow Applicant to offer post hearing exhibits. Applicant offered two additional sets of documents, which have been 
identified as Applicant's Exhibits C and D.  All exhibits were entered into evidence without objection. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN>July 25<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 2 allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under 
Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I 
make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 27 years old, </SPAN>unmarried and has one 15 month old son.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He is an employee of a defense contractor</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> alleges that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> currently has two overdue debts, 1.a. and 1.b, under Adjudicative Guideline F. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The two debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This overdue debt to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $25,455.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Applicant testified that this debt was incurred as a result of  medical treatment he received for an injury he 
suffered in 1998, when he was 19 years old. As a result of the injury, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  became unemployed, and because he had no health insurance, he was unable to pay off this debt. He consulted a 
credit counseling company, which advised him that since he could not afford to pay off this debt, he could either file for <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">bankruptcy</SPAN> or simply wait for the bills to no longer be listed on his credit 
history <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit C)</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>From 1998 until 2004, when he began his current employment, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has been unemployed or underemployed with no surplus income to resolve this debt. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> recently contacted the 
creditor to try to pay off this debt, and the creditor informed him that they will not accept payment for this debt. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A post hearing letter form this creditor, dated July 28, 2006, indicates that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
now has a zero balance on this account (Exhibit D). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This overdue debt to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">143</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his RSOR, Applicant admitted that this debt is due and owing</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. However, during his testimony, he pointed out that 
this was part of the debt that has been alleged as 1.a., above </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 2)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Department Counsel</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">agreed that this debt was part of 1.a., and therefore, 1.b. was struck as an allegation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  incurred that debt in 1998, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he </SPAN>has been and remains current on all his other debts, and he has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> also submitted 20 letters of reference from many individuals, who have known him well, including his mother, girlfriend, friend, neighbors, co-workers, and supervisor. All of them spoke 
extremely highly of him as honest, hard working and dependable <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibits C and D)</SPAN>. </P>

</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting his financial obligation 
and his former inability to satisfy his one overdue debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, I find that all of the following Mitigating Conditions (MC) are applicable in this case. MC E2.A6.1.3.1., the behavior was not recent, because the only overdue debt is one from 1998; MC 
E2.A6.1.3.2., it was an isolated incident, since there was only one overdue debt; MC  E2.A6.1.3.3., this debt was the result of an unexpected medical emergency when </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was 19 years old 
and his unemployment made it impossible to pay off this debt; MC  E2.A6.1.3.4., </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> did seek counseling, and he is current on all of his other debts, and finally, MC  E2.A6.1.3.6., </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
did contact the creditor, but they will not accept a payment and show that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has a zero balance on this debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> incurred that debt in 1998, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he</SPAN> has been and remains current on all his other debts, and he has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>I, therefore, resolve 
Guideline F for Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>
