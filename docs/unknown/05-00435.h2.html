<P>On September 29, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline B, Foreign Influence; and Guideline C, 
Foreign Preference.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement signed </SPAN>November 30, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned me on March 20, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was sent out

The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection.  The government requested that administrative notice be taken on 11 documents. The documents were marked Administrative Notice 
documents (Admin Not) I - XI. Applicant  testified on his own behalf and submitted six exhibits  which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-F.  I took administrative notice of five additional

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits to all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old senior advisor engineer for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He has held a SECRET security clearance since May 3, 1984. He has worked for his current employer for 25 years.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He lived in Israel until age 30.  From 1967 to 1970, he served his mandatory three-year service in the Israeli military as an infantry soldier.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  After his military 
service, he attended two years of college earning an associate's degree in mechanical engineering.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He then worked for less than a year as a supervisor in a government-owned oil refinery and for less 
than a year in a metal shop of a privately-owned company.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant met his wife while she was visiting Israel. She was born and raised in the United States. They married on November 16, 1978.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> About a month after their marriage, they moved to the United 
States. They chose to live in the United States because his wife's family resides in the United States and they believed the United States would be a better place to live.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> They have two daughters who 
were born and raised  in the United States, ages 23 and 25.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Both are United States citizens.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Applicant applied for United States citizenship as soon as he was eligible.  He became a United States 
citizen on August 20, 1982.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Upon moving to the United States, Applicant became a full-time student.  In 1980, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He accepted a position with his current 
employer in September 1980.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  In September 1982, he took an unpaid leave of absence to pursue a master's degree in computer science.  He was awarded his master's degree in 1984.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>All of Applicant's financial assets are in the United States. He owns a home.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> After becoming a United States citizen, he has voted in every major election.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Since becoming a United States citizen, he 
has not voted in any Israeli elections.  He has not renewed his Israeli driver's license.  He has no financial interests in Israel.  He does not participate in the Israeli national health care system.  He does 
not participate in the Israeli National Welfare System.  He is not entitled to any pension from the Israeli government or any other Israeli institution.  He is not entitled to educational benefits from the 
Israeli government. He does not pay taxes to the Israeli government. Although required by Israeli law, he did not register his children as Israeli citizens.  He has never held political office in Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant obtained a United States passport when he became a naturalized citizen.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He also maintained an Israeli passport after becoming a United States citizen. His basis for doing so was that under 
Israeli law, he is considered an Israeli citizen. He understood that he was required by law to hold a valid Israeli passport in order to travel back to Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He fully disclosed his dual citizenship with 
Israel on his current security clearance application, dated August 4, 2003, and on his previous security clearance applications submitted on February 26, 1984, and April 29, 1992. He noted on each 
application that Israel considers him to be an Israeli citizen since he was born in Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He indicated that he possessed an Israeli passport on his current security clearance application in response to 
question 15, indicating that Israel requires him to use an Israeli passport when traveling to and from Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> The security clearance questionnaires he completed in 1984 and 1992 did not ask about the 
possession of a foreign passport.    </P> 
 
<P>On November 7, 2003, Applicant was interviewed in conjunction with his background investigation.  He told the investigator that since he was born in Israel, he was required to use an Israeli passport 
when traveling to Israel.  He indicated if he was asked to surrender the passport he would do so.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>On March 11, 2005, Applicant answered interrogatories sent to him by the DOHA. He was asked to provide copies of his United States and Israeli passports.  He sent complete copies of both passports.  
His Israeli passport was issued on August 31, 2004, and does not expire until August 30, 2014.  His United States passport was issued on September 23, 1998, and does not expire until September 22, 
2008. There are no travel stamps on his Israeli passport.  There are travel stamps on his United States passport.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not learn of the security concern about possessing a foreign passport until October 17, 2005, when he received the SOR.  A copy of the August 16, 2000, memorandum signed by the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) titled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities Clarifying the Application of the Foreign 
Preference Adjudicative Guideline" was attached to the SOR.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> He immediately inquired about the procedure for surrendering his Israeli passport.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> On December 12, 2005, the Israeli Embassy 
cancelled his Israeli passport.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  He does not intend to renew his Israeli passport in the future.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's brother and sister are citizens of and reside in Israel.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  His brother, age 54, is a manager of a supermarket.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  His brother's wife is a teacher.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  His sister, age 63, lives and works on a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give 
that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for 
safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Guideline C - Foreign Preference:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or 
make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.)</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. 
Contacts with citizens of other foreign countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.(Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.)</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in 
the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) issued a memorandum to clarify, Guideline C, Foreign Preference, relative to 
cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  "The possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a United States passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to 
the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any  clearance must be denied 
or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge 
must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the 
nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's 
age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A>  <BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A>  
Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of 
the national security."<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication 
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, and  Guideline 
B, Foreign Influence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under the Foreign Preference concern.  Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  The Government has also shown Applicant renewed his Israeli 
passport after becoming a United States citizen and that he has traveled on his Israeli passport when traveling to Israel.  His possession and use of an Israeli passport after becoming a United States 
citizen is considered exercising dual citizenship. As such, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1: ( <EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM>) applies as well as FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2: 
(<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Foreign Preference Concern can be mitigated.  In Applicant's case, Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A3.1.3.1: (<EM>Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth 
in a foreign country</EM>) applies since Applicant acquired his foreign citizenship by birth in a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there is some concern that Applicant applied for and used an Israeli passport after becoming a United States citizen, he was not fully aware of the security concerns related to possessing and 
traveling on a foreign passport.  He consulted his security office each time he traveled to Israel.  He maintained his Israeli passport because he believed he was required to do so under Israeli law. Once 
he became aware of the security concern regarding possession and use of a foreign passport, he took immediate action to surrender his Israeli passport. In December 2005, his Israeli passport was 
cancelled. He does not intend to renew his Israeli passport in the future. Aside from the use of the Israeli passport, he has exercised no other rights as an Israeli citizen. The Foreign Preference security 
concern has been mitigated.  I find for Applicant under Guideline C.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the foreign influence concern, a potentially disqualifying condition is raised. The Government has established that Applicant has immediate relatives who are citizens of and reside in a foreign 
country.  His brother and sister are citizens of and reside in Israel. As such, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1: (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1: (<EM>A determination that immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates) 
in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States</EM>) has the potential to be applicable to this case. The record evidence and the testimony at the hearing established that Applicant's brother and sister are not agents of a foreign power.  
Applicant also has the burden to meet the second prong of FI MC 1 which is whether his relatives living in Israel would be in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to his relatives and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In analyzing whether a foreign relative is in a position of vulnerability it is necessary to assess the nature of the foreign countries involved.  Israel is a parliamentary democracy dependent on the United 
States' continued recognition and financial support.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A>  While Israel is an ally of the United States, there have been difficulties in U.S./Israeli relations over the Palestinian conflict, Israel's military sales 
to China, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual property, and  espionage-related cases.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> The United States remains committed to Israel's security.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A>  Although Israel is vulnerable to terrorist 
attacks, they have dealt with terrorism for a long time.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> The United States  and Israel have an overall positive record of cooperation and coordination in working against terrorism.<A HREF="05-00435.h2.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely ruled out as long as Applicant's siblings are citizens of and reside in a foreign country, Applicant's substantial ties to and preference 
for the United States lead me to conclude he can be trusted to place his obligation to the United States government ahead of any sense of obligation to his family members residing in Israel.  The people 
most important to him - his wife and two children - reside with him in the United States. He has worked for the same defense contractor for over 25 years. All of his financial assets are in the United 
States.  Although he occasionally travels to Israel to visit his siblings, he informs his security office of his travel each time. He has held a security clearance for 22 years with no security violations.  His 
superiors respect and trust him based on his integrity and work performance.  I find Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence concern. I find for Applicant under Guideline B.</SPAN></P>
