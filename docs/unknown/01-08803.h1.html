</P> 
 
<P>On June 27, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated July 31, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and 
elected to have his case decided on a written record, in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on September 18, 2001, and received an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant responded to the FORM on October 16, 2001.  The record 
in this case closed on October 24, 2001, the date the Applicant's FORM response was admitted into evidence without objection.  The 
undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on October 24, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following sole guideline: paragraph 1, Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 37-year-old support engineer employed by a U.S. Government contractor and its predecessor company since January 1996.  
The Applicant seeks to obtain a personnel security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant attended the U.S. Naval Academy from July 1982 through May 1986 and graduated with a bachelor's degree.  He served on 
active duty as a commissioned officer (O-3) in the Navy until July 1994 and has since remained in the Naval Reserve (O-4).  He was unemployed 
during two periods: August 1994 to January 1995 and April 1995 to September 1995; he worked as a temporary office worker from September 
1995 to January 1996.  He attended graduate schools in 1994-95 and 1996-97; he was awarded an MBA degree in December 1997.  The 
Applicant was married in February 1987.  He listed six children on his January 1998 security clearance application (SF-86) and had two more 
children as of his SOR answer in July 2001.  FORM item 4.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant admits that he owes over $18,000 in delinquent debts to some 12 creditors.<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  These debts fell into arrears and were charged 
off/referred for collection in 1995 during the Applicant's period of unemployment and temporary employment.  In April 1998 he was earning--as 
the sole breadwinner for his family--a gross annual salary of approximately $60,000; his personal financial statement disclosed he was making 
payments in the amount of $677 to nine creditors on a monthly basis.  FORM item 6.  Credit reports in 1998 and 1999 show that he was current 
on three revolving department store accounts.  FORM items 7 and 8.  In his response to the FORM he advises--without corroboration--that he 
has discontinued reliance on credit and has paid down a significant portion of the total.<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an 
individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance 
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully 
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P> 
 
<P>The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>GUIDELINE F - FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[1st] A history of not meeting financial obligations; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[3rd] The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P> 
 
<P>[6th] The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines contained in enclosure 2 of the Directive provide in part:</P> 
 
<P>Although adverse information concerning a single criterion<STRONG><EM> may not be sufficient</EM></STRONG> for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be 
disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally unstable behavior.</P> 
 
<P>(Emphasis added.)  The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance 
may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall 
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and 
logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on 
October 14, 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has 
said:</P> 
 
<P>"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard 
without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a 
security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's 
national security determinations."</P> 
 
<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go 
to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, 
substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error 
below.<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through 
evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's 
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail 
to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold 
a security clearance.<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant 
successfully rebutted and overcame the Government's case with regard to Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a history of financial difficulties that has resulted in a number of delinquent debts, some portion of which remain outstanding.  
This evidence falls within the scope of DC #1, which is identified on page 3 <EM>supra</EM>.  He has demonstrated a willingness and some ability, though 
living on a modest budget, to pay down/pay off the delinquent debts and not incur additional debt beyond his means.  His past due debts were not 
incurred due to misbehavior such as excessive gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.  Nor does there appear to 
this Administrative Judge to be a ratio of past due debt to annual income that is abnormal or otherwise out of line in our economy.  Nevertheless, 
the Government has shown that its security concerns have met a <EM>prima facie </EM>threshold.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In mitigation, the Applicant's financial difficulties are largely attributable to conditions beyond his control, <EM>i.e.</EM>, a prolonged period of unemployment 
and temporary employment in 1994-95.  This evidence falls within the scope of MC #3, which is identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  There is some 
evidence in his SOR admissions, his FORM response,<A HREF="01-08803.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and FORM items 5 and 6 that he has made occasional and/or periodic payments against 
his delinquent debts.  This evidence falls within the scope of MC #6, which is also identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  He has not tried to evade his 
creditors, deny his legitimate debts, or hide behind a statute of limitations argument.  He acknowledged his debts, of course, on his security 
clearance application (SF-86).  Whether an applicant has made a "good-faith effort" must be judged in part in relation to the means and 
opportunities available.  Having been asked to submit an application for a security clearance for his job at the outset of 1998, the Applicant was 
able to make payments against his delinquent debts while he had just graduated, his job seemingly secure, and he was raising a large family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative 
process discussion at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  The nature and extent of the Applicant's 
indebtedness is of considerable security concern when it is recalled that money problems and/or financial greed often lies at the heart of the 
motivation for espionage.  The circumstances in which his indebtedness was incurred and in which he addressed it within the last three years weigh 
in the Applicant's favor.  The probability of additional debt incurred in the future beyond his means is quite small.  Therefore, SOR &para;1 (financial 
considerations) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
