<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old Senior Engineer for a major defense contractor.  He was born in the Philippines in 1946 and came to the U.S. after graduating from 
college in 1967.  He has worked in the defense sector, and held a DoD security clearance, for many years, without any problems. He has family members who 
are citizens of and reside in the Philippines.  He rarely sees them and his closest contact is with his elderly mother by telephone.  His property holdings in the 
Philippines are small in relation to his assets in the U.S.  He credibly expressed his dedication to U.S. interests over that of any other country.  Mitigation has 
been established.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On March 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On March 15, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The matter was assigned to me on May 5, 2003.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 19, 2003, and the hearing was conducted on 
June 3, 2003.  At the hearing, Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits.  The Government did not call any witnesses, but offered two exhibits, which 
were marked and admitted as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2.  Applicant testified, but did not offer any exhibits. The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA 
on June 18, 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old mathematician and consultant.  The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. - 1.d., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and one 
allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant's response admits SOR 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e., and denies all other allegations.  The admissions 
are incorporated herein as a finding of fact. </P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact: </P> 
 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</P> 
 
<P>1.a. - Applicant's brother is a citizen of and resident in the Philippines.  The sister cited in the SOR now resides in the U.S.;</P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen of and resides in the Philippines. She is 83, and suffers from osteoporosis (Tr at 22).</P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Some of Applicant's uncles, aunts, and cousins are citizens of and reside in the Philippines.  Other relatives are citizens and residents of the U.S. or 
Canada;  </P> 
 
<P>1.d. - Applicant's wife owns real estate in the Philippines, inherited from her parents.  The real estate is her separate property and she retains whatever income 
there is. </P> 
 
<P>1.e. - Applicant owns real estate in the Philippines.  These are two small vacant lots, worth about $3000 to $4,000 each.  They produce no income, and 
Applicant intends to give the lots to his sons in the future.  He does not consider the lots to be an investment.</P> 
 
<P>As far as Applicant knows, none of his relatives are associated with the government of the Philippines.  He has no business interests in the Philippines or any 
financial interests there of a substantial nature.  </P> 
 
<P>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</P> 
 
<P>2.a. - Applicant knowingly falsified material facts on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), when he answered "No" to Question 17.a. 
(financial interests in a foreign country), when he knew he should have answered "Yes" and reported the information in SOR 1.d. and 1.e., above.  He 
misconstrued the question and thought the question asked only about "active" investments and he did not consider the real property to be "active"<SPAN STYLE="font-family: English111 Vivace BT"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: English111 Vivace BT"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">GUIDELINE B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question would not constitute an unacceptable security risk. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden 
(either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the Philippines in 1946.  He graduated from college with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1967, emigrated to the U.S. in the 
1970s, and became a U.S. citizen in 1980.  He began working for his present employer in 1978, and is now a Senior Engineer.  He has held a security clearance 
for many years and received a Q clearance in 1990 (GX 1 at Item 26).  There is nothing in the record indicating he has ever had any problems relating to 
classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concerns stated in the SOR are cited under Guideline B and are based on the risk of foreign influence by family members in the Philippines.  The presence 
of an applicant's close relatives who are citizens of and/or resident in a foreign country is certainly a matter of security concern.  Just as clearly, however, not all 
foreign countries create the same level of risk.  In the present case, I take official notice that the Philippines has traditionally been friendly to U.S. interests to 
the extent that a number of individuals from the Philippines are accepted into the U.S. military even before becoming naturalized citizens.  Although the risk 
exists that Applicant might be asked to disclose classified information by family members in the Philippines, the risk is less than with many other countries, and 
must be considered in context with other important factors. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the language in Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 indicates that the presence of close family in a foreign country is of concern, that concern can be 
mitigated by evidence that the risk of pressure being applied is not unacceptable <EM>and</EM> that the applicant is not likely to feel "forced to choose between loyalty to 
the persons involved and the United States."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked if anyone had asked him to act improperly during the 28 years he has been in the U.S., he responded "No," and if anyone did, he would not agree, 
because "it is wrong" (Tr at 43).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He would also report it to his security officer, because this his "fourth clearance already," and he knows what his responsibilities are.  Every time he leaves U.S. 
territory, he "reports where he is going" (Tr at 44).  Applicant's two witnesses speak high of him and do not believe he has ever violated any company rules, or 
done anything dishonest, or ever did or said anything suggesting he was not dedicated to U.S. interests (Tr at 46 - 53).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is always a chance that Applicant might be asked to act improperly in the future, even though he not been asked to do so in the past.  However, this is 
speculative since there is no direct or indirect evidence that it has occurred, or is likely to occur.  I note that Applicant has worked for a major defense contractor 
for 25 years, even before he became a U.S. citizen in 1980 (Tr at 18),<A HREF="02-01207.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and that he has held a high security clearance during much of that period.  The SOR in 
this matter is based on Applicant's 1996 security clearance application, and there is no suggestion in the record of any problematic conduct by Applicant since 
that time, except for continuing the family relationships cited in GX 1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations as to his relationships with his family members in the Philippines,  the lack of any problems in the past, and his clear recognition of 
his security responsibilities, lead me to conclude that there is minimal risk of Applicant acting against U.S. interests.  Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 
1 (family in foreign country) is applicable but, under Mitigating Condition 1, the relationships "would not constitute an unacceptable security risk."  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanation for not citing the property interests expressed in SOR 1.d. is that the property was his wife's and not his, so that under Question 17.a., 
"Do <EM>you</EM> have any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests" (emphasis added), he did not think a "Yes" answer was appropriate (Tr at 26, 
27).  As to SOR 1.e., his explanation is that the two vacant lots did not generate income and produced no profit, so that he did not consider them to be a 
"financial interest."  This explanation ignores the fact that the lots were "property" and should have reported.  However, in context, the value of the property is 
so minimal that it does not support a conclusion that Applicant was seeking to deceive the Government when he answered: "No" to Question 17.a.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, Applicant has expressed strong feelings about his identity as an American, and about where his loyalty, allegiance, and obligations belong.  From 
Applicant's testimony and demeanor, I find his testimony to be highly credible.  He has contributed to American society for 28 years, without apparent 
problems suggesting questionable judgment, unreliability, or untrustworthiness.  Under these circumstances, there is no basis for concluding that a risk exists 
that he might now start acting against U.S. interests. </SPAN></P>
