<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old U.S.-born citizen, who is a program manager for a defense contractor.  In 1999, he married a Vietnamese woman introduced to him 
by an ethnic Vietnamese co-worker.  Since immigrating to the U.S., Applicant's wife has assimilated well and became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  As a result of this 
marriage, Applicant has five in-laws in Vietnam creating a foreign influence concern.  Based on the totality of circumstances and the record evidence as a 
whole, Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concern of foreign influence based on his limited family ties to Vietnam. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 11, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke his access to classified information.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security concern under 
Guideline B for foreign influence.  Counsel for Applicant replied to the SOR on April 26, 2005, and requested a hearing.  Department Counsel indicated he was 
ready to proceed on June 3, 2005.  Counsel for Applicant submitted a supplemental answer on June 29, 2005, and reiterated his request for a hearing.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DOHA Hearing Office received the case on June 13,2005, and it was assigned to another administrative judge on the same day.  Due to caseload 
considerations, the case was reassigned to me on June 20, 2005.  On July 8, 2005, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the case to be heard on August 
2, 2005.  The case was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, without objection.  Applicant presented 
15 exhibits, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through O, without objection.  I left the record open to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit 
additional matters.  Counsel for Applicant timely submitted one additional exhibit, which was marked AE P, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) of the proceeding on August 17, 2005.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Counsel for Applicant submitted an errata sheet with corrections to the transcript, which was marked AE Q, 
without objection.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations.  His admissions are incorporated into my findings.  After a thorough review of the record, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified during the hearing, and I find his testimony credible.  He is a 47-year-old, married man, who was born, raised, and educated in the U.S.  He 
was awarded a bachelor of science degree in June 1993, with a major in mechanical engineering.  Applicant is employed as a program manager for a defense 
contractor and has been with that same employer since November 2000.  In conjunction with Applicant's current duties, his employer requested he be granted a 
secret security clearance. In February 2004, Applicant was granted an interim secret security clearance.  That clearance was suspended "within the last one or 
two months"as a result of these proceedings.  Tr. 105.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was previously married from January 1987 to August 1988.  That marriage ended in divorce.  During the summer of 1998, an ethnic Vietnamese co-worker offered to introduce Applicant to her 34-year-old single cousin, who lived in Vietnam.  The co-worker provided Applicant with her cousin's telephone 
number in Vietnam.  Applicant then called his co-worker's cousin in Vietnam and a friendship ensued.  In February 1999, Applicant went to Vietnam to meet 
his co-worker's cousin.  Their relationship developed further and they were married in Vietnam on March 8, 1999. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Shortly after the wedding, Applicant returned to the U.S. to secure a visa for his new bride.  In August 2000, all the necessary paperwork had been approved by 
the U.S. and Vietnamese governments for Applicant's wife to immigrate to the U.S.  In August 2000, Applicant returned to Vietnam to bring his wife home to 
the U.S.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife has assimilated very well to her new home and culture since arriving in the U.S.  She has taken English and mathematics courses at a local 
community college, and has made a number of local friends.  She has also learned to play the guitar and electric keyboard. She earns income by babysitting for 
her niece's child.  On September 9, 2004, she became a U.S. citizen.  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, she has registered and exercised her right to vote.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of his recent marriage, Applicant has three sisters-in-law and two brothers-in-law, who are resident citizens of Vietnam.  Applicant's wife also 
recently discovered she has a brother living in the Philippines.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Being a native-born U.S. citizen, all of Applicant's immediate family members to include his 
wife are U.S. citizens.  In contrast to the number of relatives in Vietnam, Applicant's wife has 37 relatives of Vietnamese descent, living and residing in the 
U.S.  Of those 37 relatives, three are permanent resident aliens, and the remaining 34 are U.S. citizens.  The adult relatives living in the U.S. are well educated 
and work as professionals.  AE P.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since her arrival in the U.S., Applicant's wife has returned to Vietnam once for a vacation in January 2003.  Applicant has not returned to Vietnam since he 
escorted his wife to the U.S. in August 2000.  Applicant's wife communicates with her siblings in Vietnam approximately once every two to three months by 
telephone.  Applicant does not participate in these telephone calls and has not communicated with his in-laws in Vietnam since he was last there in August 
2000.  He does not speak or understand Vietnamese.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In their spare time, Applicant and his wife enjoy hosting barbeques, going camping, and watching television and movies.  They recently purchased a home 
currently valued at $650,000.00, with a mortgage of $600,000.00.  Applicant and his wife are constantly involved in home improvement projects.  Applicant 
estimates his net worth to be "about $85,000.00."  Tr. 123.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither Applicant nor his wife have any assets in Vietnam, nor does Applicant's wife expect to inherit any assets in Vietnam.  Applicant has not had any 
dealings with anyone in Vietnam since he was last there in August 2000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of Applicant's in-laws in Vietnam have ever served in the Vietnamese military or held a position within the government.  Nor are any of those relatives in 
Vietnam aware of who Applicant works for, nor are they aware of the specific role Applicant has with his employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly respected and valued by his employer and co-workers.  It is clear from the evidence that he has made significant contributions to the 
national defense and those contributions will only be enhanced if granted a security clearance.  Applicant also enjoys a reputation among his colleagues  and 
within the community as being a true patriot with unwavering loyalty to the U.S.  In short, the record evidence supports the notion that Applicant's character is 
above reproach.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1995, President Clinton announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on July 11, 1995.  This process continues to this date.  GE 
4, GE 5, AE K, AE L, AE M,  AE N, AE O.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive.  Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving 
controverted facts.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The 
DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue, establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a 
scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Common sense suggests that t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he stronger the ties of affection or 
obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a 
foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has family ties to Vietnam, as evidenced 
by his three sisters-in-law and two brothers-in-law who are resident citizens in Vietnam.  Applicant has no direct contact with any of his in-laws in Vietnam; 
however, his wife has periodic telephone contact with her relatives in Vietnam.  Applicant's two trips to Vietnam are also evidence of his family ties.  Taken 
together, these circumstances raise a security concern under DC 1.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the MC under Guideline B and conclude that MC 1<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence shows that Applicant's in-laws are not Vietnamese agents or agents of any other foreign power,<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and so the issue under MC 1 is if the 
family members are in a position to be exploited by the Vietnamese government.  Although Vietnam is a communist-controlled country, the U.S. and Vietnam 
normalized diplomatic relations in 1995, and the normalization process continues to date.  More specific to this case, his in-laws are not employed by or 
connected to the Vietnamese military or a governmental agency or some other organization that may have an interest in U.S. classified information.  Given 
these circumstances, his family members are not in a position where they could be subject to exploitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 is clearly applicable given the fact Applicant never speaks to his in-laws and his limited affiliation with them occurs vicariously through his wife's 
telephone calls to them which occur every two to three months.<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to MC 1 and MC 3, MC 5<A HREF="04-02185.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant, as neither he nor his wife have any financial interests in Vietnam.  Applicant earns his income by 
working hard for a U.S. government contractor, Applicant and his wife own a home in the U.S., and conduct all of their banking and maintain all of their 
investments in the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The analysis does not necessarily end with the formal mitigating conditions, as other matters under the whole-person concept may mitigate the security concern.  
First, Applicant's commitment to the U.S. is very high. His decision to marry an ethnic Vietnamese woman came later in life.  Applicant's wife has embraced 
her new life in the U.S. by doing everything she can to assimilate such as learning English, taking course, and most importantly becoming a U.S. citizen.  
Second, Applicant's ties or connections to the U.S. are very strong.  He has lived in the U.S. for his entire adult life.  Since his wife's arrival here, she can fairly 
be described as a model immigrant.  Like her U.S. born husband, her ties to the U.S. are very strong.  She has 37 relatives of Vietnamese descent living in the 
U.S, 34 of whom are U.S. citizens.  Also, of those 37 relatives living in the U.S., 26 of them live within 100 miles of her.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, Applicant's professional career and financial interests are in the U.S. and that situation is unlikely to change.  These are examples of ties that bind 
most members of a participatory democracy such as the U.S.  To sum up, the record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of a self-reliant, 
industrious, mature, responsible, and trustworthy individual.  After weighing the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated 
the foreign influence security concern raised by his family ties to Vietnam.  Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the 
whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
