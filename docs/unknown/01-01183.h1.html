</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 2, 2001<A NAME="SOR's date"></A>, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated July 27, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and 
requested a hearing.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on September 10, 2001, and a notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 
2001.</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The undersigned held a hearing on October 2, 2001<A NAME="date (s) of hearing(s)"></A>.  The Department Counsel presented<A NAME="€ of gov't exhibits"></A> six exhibits only.  The Applicant's case consisted 
of the presentation of twelve exhibits and his own testimony.  Subsequently, the Applicant filed an additional exhibit L, which is and explanation of 
exhibit I.  After this exhibit was received, the record in this case was closed on October 25, 2001.  There was no objection to the receipt of 
Exhibit L into evidence.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the Transcript ("Tr") of the hearing on October 11, 2001<A NAME="transcript receipt date"></A>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two <A NAME="€ of criteria in the case"></A>guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline E (personal conduct); 
paragraph 2, Guideline F (financial considerations).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a 36<A NAME="appl.'s age"></A>-year-old married male, an employee of a U.S. Government contractor.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a secret <A NAME="level seeking or to retain?"></A>personnel 
security clearance.  The Applicant completed his Questionnaire For National Security Position, Standard Form SF-86, on March 24, 2000.  In 
response to questions 38, and 39, which refers to delinquent debts, either 180 days or 90 days delinquent, the Applicant answered "No" to both 
questions.  Paragraph 1 of the SOR lists four instances wherein the Applicant has been delinquent more than 180 days on these debts.  It appears 
that three of these debts are the result of the use of credit cards, and one debt is a hospital bill.  In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant has 
admitted all the allegations alleged in subparagraph 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.  There was no response to the allegation in subparagraph 1.e, as it was 
an alleged statement of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 30, 2000, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service, (DSS) and the Applicant's Credit 
Bureau Report was discussed, which revealed, among other matters, that he had three delinquent credit card accounts still outstanding.  These 
accounts are very old, and they are the same accounts listed in the Applicant's SOR.  At the time of the interview the Applicant gave a written 
statement to the DSS Agent regarding his financial background, together with a Personal Financial Statement, and stated that he plans to contact 
the companies involved and satisfy these debts in full.  (Exhibit No. 2).  The total amount of the said indebtedness was less than $9,000.00.  The 
Applicant settled the hospital debt on July 12, 2000. (Exhibit A), and all the other debts were satisfied or paid prior to the hearing in this matter. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.e of the SOR refers to the fact that the Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement at the time of the interview with the 
DSS Agent, which showed that he would have approximately $1,221.84 remaining each month after paying his monthly expenses, which did not 
include the four debts listed in the SOR.  However, the Applicant took care of this as he borrowed on his 401-k retirement plan from his local 
credit union to satisfy these delinquent accounts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2 of the SOR, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, alleges that the Applicant falsified material facts on his Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions, SF-86, when he executed it on March 24, 2000, in that he answered questions 39 and 39 in the negative.  As stated aforesaid, 
the questions 38 and 39, relate to any delinquent debts 180 days or 90 days old.  The SOR also alleges that the Applicant deliberately failed to 
disclose the four debts that were set out in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  The SOR further alleges that the Applicant's conduct in failing to disclose the 
four delinquent debts is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations which could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The Applicant's July 2001 
answer states that he was not aware of the said delinquent debts, as they were acquired several years ago and he had not heard from them, nor did 
he have a point of contact to satisfy these accounts.  He further stated that these debts will be paid now that he has a point of contact for them.  In 
fact, he did satisfy the three outstanding credit card debts and the old hospital bill before the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an 
individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance 
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully 
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE F - FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[1st] A history of not meeting financial obligations; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[3rd] Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[6th] The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE E - PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance 
eligibility:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    [2nd] The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[5th] The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P>

consequences involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or             recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-      able participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent                  behavioral changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance 
may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall 
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and 
logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on 
October 14, 1995.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has 
said:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard 
without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a 
security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's 
national security determinations."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go 
to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, 
substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error 
below.<A HREF="01-01183.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through 
evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's 
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail 
to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold 
a security clearance.<A HREF="01-01183.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor 
of those who testified<A NAME="witnesses or non-hearing?"></A>, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation, and explanation, successfully mitigated 
and overcome the government's case with respect to his financial considerations, Guideline F, and his personal conduct, Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant in his Answer to the SOR admitted that he owed the four debts set forth in the SOR, however, it appears that he did not have a 
point of contact with these creditors, and he forgot about them.  Once the DSS Special Agent brought them to his attention, he satisfied all of his 
creditors, by getting a loan on his retirement fund.  There was no evidence that the Applicant was negligent or willful.  It appears that it was a case 
of forgetfulness on his part.  There is evidence of rehabilitation on the part of the Applicant and that this type of conduct will not recur in the </SPAN>future.  
Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative 
process discussion at enclosure two to the Directive.  These factors are identified on pages four and five <EM>supra</EM>.  </P> 
 
<P>With reference to paragraph two of the SOR, there is no doubt that the Applicant should have listed all his delinquent debts when he answered 
questions 38 and 39 on his SF-86 security questionnaire.  However, at the time he answered the said questions, he was not aware of these debts.  
However, once he became aware of them he proceed to promptly satisfy these debts.  From the evidence of record, I cannot conclude that the 
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose to the Government the existence of these debts, as he was not aware of them when he executed his 
questionnaire.  It was a mistake on his part; nevertheless, he has paid all of his past indebtedness.  </P>
