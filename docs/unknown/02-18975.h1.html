<P>Forty-six-year-old Applicant's finances began to deteriorate before his military retirement in July 2000, and his financial situation worsened when he was 
unable to secure a job until three months later.  His inability to remain current on his various accounts resulted in several of them being charged off as bad 
debts.  He entered into payment arrangements with one creditor in December 2001.  Despite his promise to make repayment arrangements for three other 
accounts, Applicant did nothing until motivated to do so nearly a year later when he received the financial interrogatories from DOHA.  To his eventual credit, 
he has now paid off or satisfied one of the accounts and is making regular payments on the other three.  Questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and 
suitability have been satisfied.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, notarized September 2, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on 
the written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on November 20, 2003.  A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.  A submission was to be made no later than January 2, 2004, but Applicant did not take advantage of the opportunity.  The case was assigned to me 
on February 23, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted three of the four factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denied the remaining allegation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which has not been identified.  He had previously 
been granted a SECRET security clearance in November 1996 while on active military service.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from July 1980 until July 2000 when he retired.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Prior to July 2000, Applicant considered his financial 
situation to be stable.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  However, a review of his credit history, discussed further below, reveals serious financial difficulties existed prior to July 2000.  
Following his retirement, and continuing for three months until October 2000, Applicant was unable to secure employment and his financial situation 
deteriorated.  He found it necessary to prioritize the bills and continued to pay his mortgage, utilities, and other necessary bills.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  At the same time, other bills, 
such as credit cards, remained unpaid.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  As a direct result of both his already shaky finances as well as his handling of his diminished finances during the 
period of unemployment, in addition to accounts already past due, several other accounts became overdue and were eventually charged off, sent for collection, 
transferred, or sold by the creditors.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Among the outstanding financial obligations were four accounts which are the object of scrutiny because of their security 
clearance significance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant opened an individual revolving credit card account with a national bank (more fully identified in subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR) in August 1996.  The 
balance eventually rose to $3,851.00, and the account was charged off as a bad debt in November 2000.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The most recent action reported in the Credit Report 
occurred in March 2000, before he had retired from active duty.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In reality, the payment history for the account indicated it was 90 plus days past due three 
times before November 2000.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  In April 2002, Applicant indicated he was not yet making any payments towards this particular debt but promised to make 
arrangements with the creditor later in the week.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> At that time, the unpaid balance was $2,891.00.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He apparently took no such actions until one year later 
when, on May 14, 2003, a check he wrote in the amount of $100.00 was received by the creditor.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  At that time the identified balance was $3,036.90.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  In 
September 2003, Applicant stated he was making monthly payments of $100.00, and indicated the outstanding balance was down to $2,636.90.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant opened another individual revolving credit card account with a national bank (more fully identified in subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR) in October 
1996.  The balance eventually rose to $7,085.00, and the account was charged off as a bad debt in August 2002.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The most recent action reported in the Credit 
Report occurred in September 2001, over a year after he had retired from active duty and nearly one year after securing employment.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The payment history for 
the account indicated it was 90 plus days past due 10 times before September 2001.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  No mention of this account was made by Applicant in his statement of 
April 2002.  In June 2003, and again in September 2003, Applicant stated he was making monthly payments of $100.00, unsupported by any documentation, on 
an account identified as the same one referred to in the SOR but it appears to be an entirely different account with another bank.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Applicant indicated the 
outstanding balance was $6,885.16,<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> but the Credit Report reference to the account indicated the outstanding balance was up to $7,085.00, with a past due 
balance of $638.00.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant opened an individual credit card account (more fully identified in subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR) in February 1997.  The balance eventually rose to 
$5,000.00, and the account was charged off as a bad debt in April 2003, in the amount of $4,268.68.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  It is unclear when the most recent action on the account 
occurred because the Credit Report is silent as to that date.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  In reality, the payment history for the account indicated it was 90 plus days past due three times 
before April 2003.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  In April 2002, Applicant indicated he was not yet making any payments towards this particular debt but promised to make arrangements 
with the creditor later in the week.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> At that time, the unpaid balance was $4,946.00.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  He apparently took no such actions until one year later when, on May 
8, 2003, a check he wrote in an unspecified amount, claimed by Applicant to be $100.00, was received by the creditor.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  At that time the identified balance 
was $4,268.85.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  In September 2003, Applicant stated he was making monthly payments of $100.00, and indicated the outstanding balance was down to 
$3,968.85.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant opened an individual revolving credit card account with a national financial services company (more fully identified in subparagraph 1.d. of the SOR) 
in May 1997.  The balance eventually rose to $2,061.00, and the account was placed for collection as a bad debt.  The payment history for the account indicated 
it was 90 plus days past due four times before April 2003.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  In December 2001, Applicant entered into payment arrangements with the creditor collection 
agency and agreed to make monthly payments of $100.00.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Applicant and the creditor collection agency subsequently agreed to settle the account with a 
payment of $375.00, and Applicant made a payment in that amount which was received on March 7, 2003.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  The Credit Report confirms the account had been 
settled and there is a zero balance.<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>According to Applicant's most recent Personal Financial Statement, completed May 27, 2003, he has a monthly net salary of $2,001.71,<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> and a net remainder, 
after making the agreed payments in addition to current financial obligations, of $522.17.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has two children, born in 1983 and 1985, respectively.  He was married in November 1996 and subsequently divorced in December 2000.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been employed by the same government contractor since October 2000.  The quality of his work performance has not been characterized.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-18975.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline F, the government has established its case.  Despite Applicant's contentions that his financial difficulties commenced upon his 
retirement from active duty in July 2000, and was exacerbated by his three month period of unemployment, it is clear that he was in some degree of financial 
difficulty even before he retired.  Furthermore, while Applicant may have been unemployed during the three month period between July and October 2000, 
because he was drawing his military retirement pay, it was not as if he was without any income.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant may have prioritized his bills and made only necessary payments for such items as the mortgage, utilities, and child support, many of the 
accounts became overdue and were not apparently attended to for quite some time, even after he returned to full employment.  Among the unpaid accounts were 
the four which are the subject of security clearance review scrutiny.  Applicant did address one account relatively early (the account identified in subparagraph 
1.d. of the SOR).  However, despite being advised of the particular overdue accounts during his interview with the Defense Security Service in April 2002, and 
his promise to make payment arrangements on the accounts, he took no such actions for nearly one year.  His overall financial situation, initial actions in 
avoiding payments, and his subsequent inactivity, gave rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting 
financial obligations</EM>); and DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, around the same time as he received Interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant was motivated to inquire about payment arrangements and, commencing 
that same month, began making payments to three of the creditors and settled the account with the fourth creditor.  His recent efforts fall within Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  
In addition, while I discount the severity of the impact of Applicant's brief period of unemployment, or even his later divorce, there may some benefit derived 
from acknowledging that those situations, in some small degree, might also fall within FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>).  Under 
these circumstances, I now find substantial evidence of positive action on his part to pay off his outstanding debts, as well as a new resolve to avoid future 
financial problems.  I believe Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated or overcome the Government's case.  
Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
