  Applicant's drug abuse was not mitigated where recreational marijuana use occurred for fifteen years while Applicant had a security clearance, and record suggested he might  continue to use drugs in the future. He falsified his drug abuse history on a security  questionnaires in March 1996 and during a subject interview in October 1996. He disclosed his  drug abuse history only when confronted with the prospect of executing a sworn statement  containing the falsifications. Clearance denied.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On 17 January 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="97-0022.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 24 February 1997, Applicant answered the SOR and
initially requested a hearing; however, on 17 March 1997, Applicant changed his mind and
requested an administrative decision on the record. On 20 April 1997, Applicant responded to the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 27 March 1997; the record in this case
closed 20 April 1997, the day the response was filed. The case was originally assigned to a
different Administrative Judge on 23 April 1997, but was reassigned to me on 29 April 1997
because of caseload considerations. I received the case on 29 April 1997 to determine whether
clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted using marijuana from 1981 to September 1996, after receiving a
security clearance (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c.). He denied the remaining allegations of the SOR.
Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 38-year old employee of a defense contractor--originally applied for an
upgraded clearance to top secret, but now seeks to retain a secret clearance .</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	On 6 September 1978, Applicant received a secret clearance at his present place of
employment. From approximately 1981 to September 1996, Applicant used marijuana three to
six times a year at social functions.<A HREF="97-0022.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> He may use it in the future.<A HREF="97-0022.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	On 22 March 1996, Applicant falsified an OPM Security Clearance Application (SF 86,
Sep 95) (SCA)(Item 5)--executed to begin a background investigation for an upgraded
clearance--when he answered "no" to questions designed to elicit his drug abuse history. On 11
October 1996, Applicant continued to deny all involvement with illegal drugs during a subject
interview with the Defense Investigative Service. (DIS). He falsified his statements to the agent
because he feared he would lose his security clearance. Not until 17 October 1996--when he met
with the DIS agent to execute his sworn statement--did he disclose his marijuana use.<A HREF="97-0022.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant is a well qualified -------------------------- with an extensive list of project
experience with government contracts.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT (CRITERION H)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>		(3) . . . Current drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security
clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will normally result in an unfavorable
determination.</P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None..</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(2) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
		from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar
form 		used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or 		trustworthiness. . .;</P>

<P>		(3) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
		material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a personnel security or 		trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT (CRITERION J)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
	</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,
reliability  and trustworthiness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion H. Applicant's fifteen year history
of drug abuse--in apparent disregard of the illegality of that drug abuse and in apparent disregard
for his security clearance--raises serious doubts about his fitness for access to classified information.
Given the circumstances of his drug abuse over the years, I conclude Applicant is likely to use
marijuana at social functions in the future. I find criterion H. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria E. The information sought by the
Government on the SCA and during the subject interview was relevant and material to the
Government's investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, and the
Applicant knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. The Applicant's failure to fully disclose
his drug abuse history until he realized he could not shut down the application process suggests that
he cannot be relied upon to speak the truth if the truth presents possible adverse consequences for
his own interests.<A HREF="97-0022.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> He knew the answers he provided were false; and indeed he knew the answers had
to be false for him to get what he wanted--a security clearance. At no time did Applicant make any
effort to fully disclose his drug abuse history, much less a prompt, good faith effort. I find criterion
E. against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria J. The Applicant's knowing, multiple
falsifications to an agency of the federal government on matters within that agency's jurisdiction
clearly violate 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. The falsifications had the potential to influence the course of the
background investigation--in areas of legitimate concern to the Government. I find criterion J.
against the Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant's complete description of his drug abuse: "I would estimate I smoked marijuana on a three to six
times yearly basis beginning in approximately 1981 and continuing until 30 September 1996. I deny any daily or more
regular use of marijuana. I am not saying the three to six times yearly estimate is an exact figure, but it is as accurate
as I can state considering the almost fifteen year history of my use of marijuana. It certainly was never much more than
six times a year. I deny ever using any other illegal drugs, to include cocaine. I was exposed to cocaine on rare occasions
at various parties, but I never used it. I deny ever buying, growing, selling or distributing any illegal drugs. I deny
having any drug related arrests or counseling. My use of marijuana was at social gatherings where it was present. On
those occasions when I used it, it was passed around between some of the people at the social gathering." (Item 6).
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>"I cannot say for certainty that I would never use marijuana again in the future. If it were passed to me at a
party in the future, I may use it. I do not consciously plan to use marijuana at any of these social gatherings. (Item 6).
Applicant repudiates this statement in his answer to the SOR (Item 3). However, I find the repudiation not credible. Item
6 is Applicant's sworn statement which bears indication of edits by Applicant. The stated intention of the sworn
statement is consistent with Applicant's description of the nature and circumstances of his marijuana abuse over the
years.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>However, he first attempted to end the application process for his top secret clearance. When the agent
informed Applicant that the allegations of drug use would still have to be addressed, Applicant disclosed his marijuana
use.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Applicant's response to the SOR and his request for administrative hearing contain considerable venting about
the contents of his background investigation and the security process in general. I note that I have been provided only
the contents of the FORM sent to Applicant, not the complete investigation which Applicant apparently obtained from
the DIS.  However, I observe that Applicant distributes responsibility for his situation everywhere but where it belongs.
There is no record evidence to suggest that Applicant was compelled to use marijuana after receiving his clearance in
1978; nor record evidence to suggest that Applicant was compelled to falsely answer the drug questions on his SCA;
nor record evidence to suggest that Applicant was compelled to falsely answer the drug questions put to him during his
first DIS interview.
