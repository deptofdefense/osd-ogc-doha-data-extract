</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, a 39-year-old man, is an aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor. The record evidence is insufficient to overcome the negative security 
implications stemming from his history of illegal drug involvement. In addition, under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Defense Department is prohibited from granting or 
renewing a security clearance for Applicant based on his current drug use; a waiver is not authorized. Applicant is also unable to extenuate or mitigate his 
deliberate falsification of relevant and material facts about his long-term history of illegal drug involvement (1) on his security-clearance application, (2) during 
an interview to an investigator, and (3) in a sworn statement provided to an investigator. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline H for drug involvement, Guideline E for personal conduct, and Guideline J for criminal conduct.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2003, and he requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing. In his one-page Answer, 
Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR except the following subparagraphs: 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h. Thereafter, Department Counsel prepared and 
submitted its written case. The File of Relevant Material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on or about November 20, 2003, and it was received by Applicant  
December 4, 2003. Applicant's written response to the FORM was due January 3, 2004, and no response was received. The case was assigned to me January 
23, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following essential 
findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>In general, I find that the record evidence as a whole is sufficient to establish, by substantial evidence, the occurrence of all the factual events alleged in SOR 
subparagraphs 1.a - 1.q, 2.a - 2.c, and 3.a.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 39-year-old man. He works as an aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor. The record is silent concerning Applicant's abilities and attributes as 
an employee. Applicant was previously granted a security clearance in November 1997. </P> 
 
<P>His first marriage in June 1985 ended in divorce in June 1998. He remarried in October 1998. He is the father of two children, a daughter born in August 1984 
and a son born in November 1985. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a long-term history of illegal drug use dating to 1977. His primary drug of choice is marijuana, which he has used since 1977 to at least March 4, 
2003. He started using marijuana regularly in 1981. Since then, he has smoked it two to three times weekly. At times, he has smoked marijuana as frequent as 
daily. </P> 
 
<P>In addition to using marijuana, he used cocaine during 1991 - 1992, ecstasy in 1991 - 1992, LSD in 1991, quaaludes in 1987, hashish  during 1980 - 1981, 
amphetamines during 1979 - 1981, and prescription drugs without a prescription in 1977 and during 1979-1980. Applicant also completed a 30-day outpatient 
program with a drug abuse program during the summer of 1979 or 1980.</P> 
 
<P>During October 2002, Applicant completed a security-clearance application, also known as a SF 86. In response to a specific question<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> about his use of illegal 
drugs and drug activity within the last seven years, Applicant answered "No" denying any and all illegal drug use. In response to another drug-use question,<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> he 
answered "No" denying the use of a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Nowhere in his security-clearance application did Applicant 
reveal any information about his history of illegal drug use.</P> 
 
<P>On or about January 6, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). During that interview, Applicant denied 
using any illegal drugs within the past seven years.</P> 
 
<P>A few days later on January 9, Applicant was interviewed again by the same DSS special agent. At the conclusion of the interview, Applicant signed a sworn 
statement stating he had used marijuana once in about 1978 or 1979; he denied any other illegal drug use or other involvement with illegal drugs.  </P> 
 
<P>On or about March 5, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by another DSS special agent. The  interview produced a signed, sworn statement detailing Applicant's 
history of illegal drug use dating from 1977 to as recently as March 4, 2003, including the 30-day outpatient drug abuse program he attended during the summer 
of 1979 or 1980. Concerning his future intentions, Applicant said "I cannot state that I will never use marijuana again in the future, particularly in light of the 
fact that I used it last night."<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Concerning his denials of illegal drug use or drug involvement on his security-clearance application, Applicant stated:</P> 
 
<P>I admit that I deliberately falsified my Security Clearance Application (SCA), dated 23 Oct 02, by failing to reveal any of my illegal drug usage or involvement. 
I answered "no" to all questions concerning illegal drugs because I was concerned that I'd lose my job at [the company] if I provided truthful answers to those 
questions. I was also slightly concerned that my truthful answers could negatively affect my security clearance.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In addition, Applicant admitted deliberately lying to the DSS special agent who conducted the January 2003 interviews as well as providing a false sworn 
statement on January 9, 2003. Applicant did so because he was concerned he would lose his job if he was truthful.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following security guidelines are most pertinent 
here: Guideline H for drug involvement,<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Guideline E for personal conduct,<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and Guideline J for criminal conduct.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an 
applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against them.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In addition, an 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be 
allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>1. Drug Involvement</EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline H, a security concern may exist based on improper or illegal involvement with drugs. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs is relevant to 
the security-clearance process for several reasons: (1) drug abuse indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law; (2) drug abuse weakens judgment; (3) 
some types of drug use reflect a tendency toward irresponsible or high risk behavior; (4) users of illegal drugs may be susceptible to blackmail, especially if 
exposure of drug use could cost them their job; (5) drug abuse or dependence often indicates the presence of broad emotional or personality problems of 
security concern; or (6) drug use may cause financial problems, leading to criminal activity to finance a drug habit.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the available information, a security concern is raised by Appellant's long-term history of illegal drug use. Applicant's illegal drug use dating 
from 1977 to as recently as March 4, 2003, is a solid basis to question Applicant's suitability to possess a security clearance. His long-term history of illegal 
drug use (primarily marijuana use) constitutes drug abuse and indicates  unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Aggravating the situation, his marijuana 
use took place after he had been granted a security clearance in 1997 and during his recent background investigation (January - March 2003). Given these 
circumstances, DC 1,<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> DC 2,<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> and DC 5<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>I have reviewed the mitigating circumstances under Guideline H and conclude none apply. First, Applicant's illegal drug use includes using marijuana during 
arch 2003, the day before his third DSS interview. And so, it cannot be viewed as mitigated by the passage of time. Second, Applicant's long-term history of 
illegal drug use (primarily marijuana use) dating from 1977 to March 2003 is the direct opposite of an isolated or aberrational event. Third, given his long-term 
history of illegal drug use, his marijuana use in March 2003, along with his statement that he may use marijuana in the future, Applicant has failed to show that 
he will not use illegal drugs in the future. To sum up, Applicant has failed to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns. Guideline H is decided against 
Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>2. Application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 </EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the normal security concerns of Guideline H, this case presents the issue of whether Applicant is--as a matter of law--ineligible for a security 
clearance based on his illegal drug use.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (the so-called Smith Amendment), the Defense Department may not grant or renew a security 
clearance for an applicant who falls under any of four statutory categories.<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> The statutory category at issue here is &sect; 986(c)(2), which provides as follows: 
"The person is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802))." The 
statute also provides that the  Secretary of Defense and the secretary of the relevant military department may, in a meritorious case,  authorize an exception to 
the statutory prohibition for persons in two of the four statutory categories; namely, paragraphs (1) and (4) of &sect; 986(c). An exception is not authorized for 
persons falling under paragraph (2) of &sect; 986(c), the category at issue here.</P> 
 
<P>The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a June 7, 2001, memorandum implementing the Smith Amendment. Attachment 1 to that memorandum is official 
policy guidance designed to assist in implementing the statutory prohibitions. Concerning users of illegal drugs, the policy guidance is that the Smith 
Amendment did not change the substance of the Guideline H, the adjudicative guideline for drug involvement. In particular, the official policy guidance is as 
follows: "Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance is not considered eligible for a security clearance." Reading the 
June 7, 2001, memorandum and its attachments together indicate that it is the position of the Defense Department that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(2) applies if a person 
<EM>is currently</EM> an unlawful user of controlled substances. In other words, &sect; 986(c)(2) does not create a <EM>per se</EM> or one-strike rule for persons who engage in one-time, isolated, or aberrational drug abuse.</P> 
 
<P>The question here is whether Applicant <EM>is currently</EM> an unlawful user of controlled substances. Based on the record evidence as a whole, mostly notably 
Applicant's March 2003 marijuana use--the day before his third DSS interview during the ongoing background investigation--coupled with his expressed 
intent that he may use marijuana in the future, I conclude Applicant is currently an unlawful user of controlled substances for purposes of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. 
Accordingly, Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance; a waiver is not authorized.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>3. Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be 
trusted to properly safeguard and handle classified information. T</SPAN>he deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document 
or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance, processing for a position of responsibility, or in other official matters is a security 
concern. It is "deliberate" if it is done knowingly and willfully. Omission of a past arrest or past drug use, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely 
forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be 
reported. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, considering the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline E. First, Applicant deliberately falsified his answers 
to Question 27 and 28 on the security-clearance application. Second, Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material facts during his January 6<SUP>th</SUP>  interview 
by denying the use of  illegal drugs within the past seven years. Third, Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material facts in his sworn statement of 
January 9<SUP>th</SUP> by grossly understating his history of illegal drug use when he stated he had used marijuana once. Given these circumstances, DC 2<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and DC 3<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> 
apply against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none apply.  Applicant's falsifications are neither extenuated nor mitigated because 
he was concerned that telling the truth about his illegal drug history might affect his employment or security clearance. An applicant who deliberately fails to 
provide full, frank, and candid answers to questions about his background is not a suitable candidate for access to classified information. Making a false 
statement to the federal government is serious business not easily mitigated or explained away. Viewed in this light, and considering the record evidence as a 
whole, Applicant has not mitigated or extenuated his three falsifications. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>4. Criminal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or 
procedures</SPAN> concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Of concern here is Applicant's </SPAN>deliberate falsification of relevant and material facts about his long-term history of illegal drug involvement (1) on his security-clearance application, (2) during an interview to an investigator, and (3) in a sworn statement provided to an investigator. His conduct amounts to making false 
statements within the jurisdiction of a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>These are federal criminal offenses at the felony level. Given these 
circumstances, DC 1<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="03-08100.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. Finally, I have reviewed Guideline J's mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J 
is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
