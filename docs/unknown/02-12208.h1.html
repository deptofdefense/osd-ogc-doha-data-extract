<P>Applicant, a 26-year-old avionics engineer, has a grandmother, aunts, and uncles who are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of China.  All 
members of his immediate family are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  The Government failed to establish that Applicant has "close" ties of 
affection or obligation to any of his associates in the PRC.  Even if it had, Applicant demonstrated that these associates do not make him vulnerable to coercion 
or exploitation.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  In accordance with the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-12208.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-12208.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 25 March 2003 detailing why a clearance was not granted and 
recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the SOR, DOHA 
alleged Applicant failed to meet the foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B) personnel security guidelines of the Directive. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 8 April 2003.  The case was assigned to me on 2 May 2003.  I scheduled a hearing on 19 June 2003, but it was 
delayed to accommodate the schedule of Applicant's counsel.  On 30 June 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of three exhibits.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and 
submitted 21 exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 7 July 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, an avionics engineer, was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1977.  Tr. 25; Ex. 1 at 1.  In 1987, his father came to the U.S. as a 
visiting scholar.  His mother followed as a dependent in 1988.  Tr. 26.  From 1988 until 1989, when he was allowed to join his parents in the U.S., Applicant 
lived with his aunt in the PRC.  Tr. 28, 32.  In 1990, after the Tiananmen Square Massacre of June 1989, visiting Chinese scholars, such as Applicant's father, 
and their families were granted asylum by the U.S.  Tr. 29.  Applicant and both his parents became naturalized U.S. citizens.  </P> 
 
<P>In 1991, Applicant's only sibling came to the U.S. as a visiting scholar.  She married, has two children, and has since become a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Tr. 26-27.  None of Applicant's immediate family live in the PRC.  Applicant has no property or financial interests in the PRC and does not support any of his 
relatives there.  To his knowledge, none of Applicant's relatives are or were members of the Communist Party.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant immigrated to the U.S. on his PRC passport.  He traveled on that passport with his parents to the PRC in 1995, when he was 18 years old, to visit 
relatives.  Tr. 33.  Applicant renewed his PRC passport in January 2000 and traveled on it to England for business in February 2001.  Tr. 40; Ex G at 5.  
Applicant became a U.S. citizen in March 2001 and received his U.S. passport in April 2001.  Ex. 1 at 1.  In December 2002, Applicant traveled to the PRC 
with his mother to visit relatives.  When he tried to get a visa for his U.S. passport, the Chinese authorities canceled his PRC passport.  Tr. 37.  Applicant did 
not travel on his PRC passport after becoming a U.S. citizen.  Tr. 40.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C that Applicant renewed his PRC passport and still maintains it despite having a U.S. passport (&para; 1.a.) and 
Applicant still maintained an unexpired PRC passport in his possession as of 12 March 2003 (&para; 1.b.).  Individuals who act in ways that indicate a preference for 
a foreign country over the U.S. may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant renewed his PRC passport after immigrating to the U.S., it was before he became a U.S. citizen and was entitled to a U.S. passport.  
Applicant believed the PRC passport was no longer valid after he became a U.S. citizen.  <EM>See </EM>Ex. M.  Regardless, the PRC canceled the passport in November 
2002.  Under the circumstances, there is no evidence Applicant meets any of the disqualifying conditions under Guideline C or that he has a foreign preference 
for the PRC.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicants parents and sibling are citizens of the PRC and naturalized U.S. citizens (SOR &para; 2.a.) and he 
maintains contact with his grandmother, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who are citizens and residents of the PRC (SOR &para; 2.b.).  A security risk may exist when an 
applicant's immediate family and other persons to whom she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject 
to duress.  Such contacts have the potential to make an individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish by substantial evidence that any member of Applicant's immediate family is a citizen of the PRC.  Under Article 9 of the 
Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, Applicant, his parents, and his sibling lost their PRC citizenship upon their naturalizations.  Ex. M at 1-2.  
Finding on &para; 2.a. is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted that his grandmother, aunts, and uncles are citizens and residents of the PRC.  He further admitted that he "still feel[s] affection" for his 
aunt and grandmother because "they are my aunt and grandmother."  Tr. 50.  An applicant who has "<EM>close </EM>ties of affection or obligation" to citizens or residents 
of a foreign country may be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  DC 1.  The evidence, however, does not establish that Applicant's ties of 
affection are close.  Other than his two visits to the PRC, that he made with his parents in the past 14 years, Applicants only communication with his aunt and 
grandmother has been through telephone calls his parents make while he is visiting them.  He does not send them gifts or assist them financially in any way.  
None of the disqualifying conditions under Guideline B apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if I were to find DC 1 applicable to Applicant, he has sufficiently mitigated any security 
concerns raised by the disqualifying condition.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A determination that an applicant's foreign contacts are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could 
force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the family member or associate and loyalty to the U.S. is a mitigating condition under Guideline B.  MC 1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
inquiry in a foreign influence case, however, is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or connections are agents of a foreign power.  
Rather, the foreign contacts or connections must also be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a <EM>position of vulnerability </EM>to be influenced by 
coercive or noncoercive means, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability.  ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Feb. 24, 2003).  Thus, in addition to considering the nature of Applicant's contacts with the foreign individual, we must also evaluate (1) whether the 
country in which the foreign contacts live is hostile to and has interests inimical to those of the U.S., and (2) whether the applicant would have access to 
information of interest to, and targeted for collection by, that nation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is hostile to, and has interests inimical, to those of, the U.S.  The PRC is a totalitarian state that depends on the suppression of its people.  The PRC 
has been involved in espionage against the U.S., both military and economic.  Nevertheless, Applicant's associates in the PRC are not foreign agents (MC 1), 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his contacts with them are casual and infrequent (MC 3), he promptly reported all contacts with these associates and his trip to the PRC to proper authorities 
(MC 4), and he has no overseas financial interests (MC 5).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  After reviewing all the evidence, I am convinced Applicant's associates in the PRC are not such as 
to place him in a position of vulnerability that could force him to choose between loyalty to the associates and loyalty to the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Finding is for Applicant.  </SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
