<P>	Although his family ties to Taiwan raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully 
mitigated the concern because the totality of facts and circumstances show his family ties do not pose 
an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>	On August 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke 
access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline B for foreign influence based on Applicant's 
family members (immediate and in-laws) who are resident citizens of Taiwan (Republic of China). 
Applicant answered the SOR on September 5, 2003, and requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>	Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on October 29, 2003, and the case 
was initially assigned to an administrative judge the same day. On November 13, 2003, the case was 
reassigned to me due to case load considerations. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the 
hearing for December 18, 2003.  Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as 
scheduled. DOHA received the transcript January 9, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>							<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	<CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>	In his Answer, Applicant admitted, with explanation, to all the SOR allegations, and his 
admissions are incorporated into my findings. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, 
and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>	Applicant testified during the hearing, and I find his testimony credible. In making this 
finding, I note that English is not Applicant's native language and allowances have been made for 
potential communication problems.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>	Applicant is a 50-year-old married man. He is seeking to obtain access to classified 
information for his employment as a staff engineer for a defense contractor. </P> 
 
<P>	Applicant was born and raised in Taiwan. As required by Taiwanese law, from September 
1973 to September 1975, Applicant served in the Taiwanese Army. He was an enlisted soldier and 
was trained as a medic. He satisfactorily completed his Taiwanese military obligation and that was 
verified when Applicant immigrated to the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>						</P> 
 
<P>	In approximately July 1977, the then 24-year-old Applicant immigrated to the U.S. He 
obtained a family-based visa through his sister's sponsorship as she had obtained U.S. citizenship 
in 1974. He has resided continuously in the U.S. since his arrival in 1977.</P> 
 
<P>	From September 1979 to July 1982, Applicant was a student at a large U.S. university. He 
completed his studies, and in September 1982 was awarded a bachelor's degree in electrical 
engineering. He has since been employed by a variety of companies (including defense contractors), 
and his area of expertise is working in the microwave field.</P> 
 
<P>	In June 1984, Applicant obtained U.S. citizenship through the naturalization process. In April 
1985, Applicant was granted a security clearance for his employment at that time. </P> 
 
<P>		</P> 
 
<P>	Applicant started working for his current defense contractor employer in April 2001. In 
February 2002, Applicant completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 1) disclosing he was 
born in Taiwan, obtained U.S. citizenship in 1984, and had immediate family members who are 
Taiwanese citizens residing in Taiwan. He disclosed traveling to Taiwan in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 
and 2001. His most recent trip to Taiwan to visit family was in November 2003. Applicant also 
disclosed that his wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Taiwan.</P> 
 
<P>	Applicant began dating his spouse while on a trip to Taiwan. They married in 1988, and she 
was allowed to immigrate to the U.S. in 1989. All of her family members are citizen residents in 
Taiwan. </P> 
 
<P>	Applicant's father is deceased. He was employed for the Taiwanese Liquor and Tobacco 
Bureau, which was a government agency that regulated the sale of those items. Applicant's mother 
worked for a few years, but was primarily a housewife. Besides his U.S. citizen sister, Applicant has 
an older brother who is a citizen resident of Taiwan. He is a retired school teacher. Applicant 
maintains monthly contact by telephone with his mother, while he has telephone contact with his 
brother two to three times per year. As his mother is 83 years old, Applicant intends to make annual 
trips to Taiwan to visit her.  </P> 
 
<P>	Since his father's death, Applicant's brother has provided financial support to Applicant's 
mother. Since his brother's retirement, Applicant assists his brother by providing about $300.00 
monthly to his mother. </P> 
 
<P>	Applicant's in-laws (father-in-law, mother-in-law, and two brothers-in-law) are citizen 
residents of Taiwan. His father-in-law is retired, but formally worked in an office that processed 
visas for Taiwanese citizens to travel to the U.S. It appears the father-in-law was employed by the 
U.S. Government as a local national employee. Applicant's mother-in-law, since her marriage, has 
worked as a housewife raising her three children and taking care of household matters. One brother-in-law works as a television director, and the other works in human resources for a private company. 
Other than mandatory military service, the brothers are not employed by or connected with the 
Taiwanese government, military, or law enforcement. Applicant's spouse has monthly contact by 
telephone with her parents, and she speaks with her brothers two to three times per year. When in 
Taiwan with Applicant, his spouse also visits her family. </P> 
 
<P>	</P> 
 
<P>	Applicant is a homeowner and he has lived at the same address since 1991. He estimates the 
market value of his home at $400,000.00. He and his spouse have about $200,000.00 in savings and 
investments. Neither he nor his spouse has any financial interests in Taiwan.</P> 
 
<P>	</P> 
 
<P>	Applicant considers the U.S. his home as he has lived here longer than he lived in Taiwan. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant pledges his loyalty to the U.S., and he would never compromise classified information, 
and he would report any approaches or suspicious contacts he encountered. In particular, although 
he has family members in Taiwan, Applicant points to his sister, spouse, and his son, a native-born 
U.S. citizen, as his highest concern:</P> 
 
<P>	As I said before, my highest concern is my family in the United States, my son, my 
wife, all my properties here. So, even they point a gun either to my mother or my in-laws head, there's no way - - I will say it again - - no way - - never I trading or 
sacrifice American Government's benefit or hurt American Government and just try 
to protect that family member because I also have to take care of my own family and 
they are in the United States (sic).<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>	As requested by Department Counsel, I took official or administrative notice of the following 
facts: Taiwan is one of several countries that is actively engaged in economic espionage against 
private industry in the U.S. (Exhibit 3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's 
security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions 
(MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial 
commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person 
concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the presence or 
absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy 
guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following security guideline is most 
pertinent here: Guideline B for foreign influence.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>	</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> There is no

has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  
in a security-clearance case is less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal Board 
has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
"Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Once

the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security

Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">					</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's 
immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Common sense suggests that t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he stronger the ties of affection or obligation, 
the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate 
is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning 
family ties, the language of Guideline B does not require a conclusion that an unacceptable security 
concern exists based solely on an applicant's family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an 
applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security concern under Guideline B.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's compulsory military service as a medic in the Taiwanese Army during the mid-1970s is of little if any security significance. It took place before he immigrated to the U.S. in 1977 
and before he obtained U.S. citizenship in 1984. Moreover, military duty and training as a medic 
does not make Applicant more susceptible to foreign influence as opposed to military duty and 
training in some other field such as military intelligence. Finally, military service for a foreign 
country is usually a matter alleged under Guideline C for foreign preference, not Guideline B for 
foreign influence. Given these circumstances, SOR subparagraph 1.e is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Addressing the remaining SOR subparagraphs, based on the record evidence as a whole, the 
government has established its case under Guideline B. The concern here is Applicant's immediate 
family members and in-laws in Taiwan. DC 1<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> applies because Applicant's spouse is a dual citizen 
of the U.S. and Taiwan, his mother and brother are resident citizens of Taiwan, and his in-laws are 
resident citizens of Taiwan. Although his in-laws are not immediate family members, I presume 
Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to them through his spouse.  In addition, DC 6<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
applies based on Applicant's nearly annual travel to Taiwan since it has the potential to make him  
vulnerable to foreign influence. Along with Applicant's family members in Taiwan, these 
circumstances raise a security concern due to the potential for foreign influence.<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The remaining 
disqualifying conditions do not apply given the record evidence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I have reviewed the MC under Guideline B and conclude that MC 1<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence shows Applicant's family members are not Taiwanese agents, and so the issue 
under MC 1 is if the family members are in a position to be exploited by the Taiwanese authorities. 
Because Taiwan is one of several countries engaged in economic espionage against private industry 
in the U.S., Applicant has the burden to show his family ties to Taiwan do not pose a security risk 
or concern. On this point, I note that none of his family members are employed by or connected to 
the Taiwanese government and therefore vulnerable to pressure from that government. Likewise, 
none of his family members are associated with a political, scientific, commercial, or other activity 
that would benefit from obtaining U.S. national security information. All his family members are 
involved in rather ordinary, work-a-day lives that make it most unlikely that they would have an 
undue interest in Applicant's work or that they would come to the attention to Taiwanese authorities. 
For example, the record shows his 83-year-old mother is a retired housewife, and his brother is a 
retired school teacher. Given these circumstances, there is not a reasonably foreseeable risk<A HREF="02-24060.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> that 
his family ties might be exploited. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has met his burden of showing 
that MC 1 applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Although MC 1 is the only applicable mitigating condition, the analysis does not necessarily 
end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security concern. Applicant's ties or 
connections to the U.S. are substantial and deserving of consideration in mitigation. He has lived in 
the U.S. since 1977--since the age of 24--nearly all his adult life. Since his arrival here, Applicant 
can fairly be described as a model immigrant. He earned a college degree in electrical engineering 
and has worked in his field since 1982, he possesses and uses a U.S. passport to the exclusion of a 
foreign passport, and he pays state and federal income taxes. Moreover, his spouse and native-born 
son, professional career, and financial interests are in the U.S. and that situation is unlikely to 
change. These are examples of ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy such as the 
U.S. His substantial ties to the U.S. reinforce and lend credibility to Applicant's pledge that he would 
resist and report any potential foreign influence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	To sum up, the record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of an 
industrious, mature, responsible, and trustworthy individual. After weighing the record evidence as 
a whole, it is my commonsense determination that the facts and circumstances show Applicant's 
family ties to Taiwan do not pose an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching 
my decision, I have considered the whole-person concept and the appropriate factors and guidelines 
in the Directive. And </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have weighed the record evidence as a whole, and conclude the favorable 
evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence. Under the totality of the facts and circumstances, I 
conclude Applicant has met his burden. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
