<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 24, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under Guideline M, misuse of information technology systems, and Guideline E, personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated April 8, 2005,  Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted all 
the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 28, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 18, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7. The exhibits were admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his behalf and submitted nine exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A through I. The 
exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on October 31, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old test engineer who has worked for a government contractor in that capacity since 2002. Applicant has been married for 20 years, and 
has a 17-year-old daughter, and a 15-year-old son. Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 1982 to 2002, retiring honorably as a Major. Applicant has held a 
security clearance since 1985, without incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While working for a government contractor Applicant was furnished a government-issued computer. Applicant worked for the contractor on a military base. 
Applicant's computer did not have access to classified information or sensitive information. Applicant had difficulty transitioning from the pace of military life 
to that of civilian life. While at work, in approximately November 2002, Applicant became bored at certain times and began surfing the internet. Although it 
was not his original intention to access pornographic websites, he stumbled upon some pornographic sites. Applicant accessed pornographic websites from 
November 2002 until May 2003, when he was confronted by his employer. The frequency in which Applicant would access the websites would depend on his 
work load. If he was busy he might not access them during a week. If things were slow he might access them several times a day. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon being confronted by his employer, Applicant admitted his transgressions. He was reprimanded by his employer and his 2003 bonus was withheld, and his 
2004 expected merit increase was reduced by at least one percent. Applicant was retained by the company and warned that any further transgressions would 
result in employment termination. Despite the punishment Applicant received, he continued to perform his duties in an exemplary manner and it was reflected 
as such on his performance appraisals.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified credibly and admitted that he accessed unauthorized websites of a pornographic nature. Applicant has no other adverse actions in his past. 
Applicant's actions showed a lack of judgment, and were totally out of character. Applicant admitted he made a terrible mistake. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant informed his wife of what he had done. She was shocked and disappointed, but has remained committed to him. Applicant informed his two teenage 
children that he inappropriately viewed pornographic material at work and that his transgressions could cost him his job. They too were disappointed, but 
support him. Applicant informed his wife's parents and asked for their forgiveness. They did forgive him and pray for him. Applicant did not tell his parents 
because his father suffers from Alzheimer's disease and his mother has the responsibility of caring for him. Applicant felt his father would not understand and 
he did not want to burden his mother with additional stresses. Some of Applicant's friends are also aware of what he did. Applicant does not hide what he did 
and readily admits to his actions. Applicant was informed by his supervisor that he should not tell other employees that he works with about what happened. 
Although admittedly embarrassed Applicant stated "I don't hide and I don't not tell the truth, ...."<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant credibly testified that he had never accessed anything inappropriate while serving with the Marines, nor has he accessed anything inappropriate since 
he was caught in May 2003. If Applicant gets bored he uses his time in a more productive way that benefits his employer. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant does admit to intentionally clicking on sites that contained pornographic images, he did not intentionally save images to be viewed later or 
put into files. Rather the computer did save the images as part of its normal function. Applicant was not aware that the computer automatically saved the images 
he accessed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is viewed by his facility security officer as an honest man, who never denied what he did wrong. She does not believe him to be a security risk. 
Applicant is also viewed by some people he works with as a trustworthy and reliable employee, despite having made a grave error in judgment. It is believed 
that his actions are inconsistent with his character. The fact that he readily admitted his mistake and has not tried to hide his transgressions is also attributable to 
his integrity. Applicant has an outstanding reputation with his employer, and after the incident he received an outstanding performance award for his support of 
a program he was working on. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline M, pertaining to misuse of information technology systems, and Guideline E, personal conduct considerations, with their respective DC and MC, 
apply in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts 
and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct 
and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to 
which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) 
the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once 
the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline M-Misuse of information technology systems and noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to these systems may 
raise security concerns about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information. 
Information technology systems include all related equipment used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, and storage of classified or 
sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline M and Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Misuse of Information Technology Systems Disqualifying Condition (MI DC) E2.A13.1.2.3 (<EM>Removal (or use) of hardware, software 
or media from any information technology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations) </EM>is 
applicable. Applicant accessed pornographic material on his government furnished computer in violation of government regulations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions under Misuse of Information Technology Systems Mitigating Conditions (MI MC) to include MI MC 
E2.A13.1.3.1 <EM>(The misuse was not recent or significant); </EM>MI MC E2.A13.1.3.2 (<EM>The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent);</EM> MI MC E2.A13.1.3.3 (<EM>The 
introduction or removal of media was authorized);</EM> and MI MC E2.A13.1.3.4 <EM>(The misuse was an isolated event).</EM> I conclude MI MC E2.A13.1.3.1 applies. 
Applicant's actions last occurred in May 2003, over two and a half years ago. Since that time Applicant has advised his wife, children, in-laws and friends of 
what he did. I have considered the general mitigating guidelines when applying the facts of this case to the regulation. I especially considered the recency of the 
conduct,<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> over two and a half years ago. I have considered the absence or presence of rehabilitation,<A HREF="04-00423.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> in this case Applicant readily admitted his error in 
judgment, acknowledged it to his family, vowed never to do it again, and continued to perform in an exemplary manner since being punished. I have also 
considered the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  Applicant's actions since the incident, his work record, his 
remorse and actions  in telling those who are very close to him, along with his credible testimony shows he is totally committed to never being involved in such 
a situation again.  I have considered all of the other mitigating conditions listed above and find they do not apply. However, I do find that Applicant has 
successfully mitigated the security concerns regarding his conduct as previously discussed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 <EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, 
employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances); </EM>PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an 
individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress</EM>,<EM> such as engaging in activities, which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or 
community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail) </EM>and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of 
any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency) </EM>apply in this case. Applicant accessed unauthorized pornographic websites on 
his government computer. His supervisors became aware of his actions and his conduct is of the type that could increase his vulnerability to coercion or 
exploitation. Applicant did this over a period of time which showed a pattern of rules violation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Personal Conduct  Mitigating Condition (PE MC) E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has 
taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress)</EM> and conclude it applies. Although Applicant's actions 
and violations were not a one time aberration, Applicant has accepted responsibility, continued to work diligently for his employer, and has told those closest to 
him, his family and friends, of his deeds. These positive steps and Applicant's credible assertions that he has ceased all such activity, had never done it before 
these occurrences and has never done it since, significantly reduce his vulnerability to coercion and exploitation. Based on these facts and the analysis 
previously provided, I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns regarding his personal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. There is no question that Applicant exercised very poor judgment in his actions that give rise to this case. However, when viewing the whole 
person, I must also consider Applicant's 20 years of honorable military service, the fact he has held a security clearance since 1985 without incident, his 
continued commitment to his work despite being embarrassed about his actions, the fact that he has confessed his transgressions to his wife, children, in-laws 
and friends, are all important factors to consider. I find Applicant has rehabilitated himself and it is highly unlikely that he will be involved in any adverse 
actions in the future. Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns regarding the misuse of information technology systems and personal conduct.</SPAN></P>
