<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old married man employed by a defense contractor as a life support supervisor with a history of financial problems as evidenced by 
charged off bad debts, an automobile repossession, a paid money judgment, and approximately $750,000 owed to more than 200 creditors stemming from the 
business activities of his corporation, of which he is the sole corporate officer. Given that Applicant has no realistic or firm plan to resolve any of the 
indebtedness, he is unable to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F for financial considerations. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 25, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the 
administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.</P> 
<P>On October 14, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record. In his Answer, Applicant admits to the 
SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f in part, and 1.g; he denies the allegations in subparagraphs 1.e and 2.a.</P> 
<P>On November 5, 2002, DOHA assigned this case to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Thereafter, on December 2, 2002, a notice of hearing 
was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for December 19, 2002, at a location near Applicant's place of employment. Applicant appeared without 
counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 2, 2003. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old married man. He and his spouse have four children, all daughters. </P> 
<P>He is employed by a defense contractor as life support supervisor in the aerospace industry. He's worked for this company since about September 1999. 
Previously, from 1981 to 1986,  he worked at the same location, but for a different company, and he held a security clearance without incident. He was laid off 
in 1986 due to no fault of his own and was self-employed from then until September 1999. In conjunction with his current employment, Applicant has applied 
to obtain a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant is an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Air Force serving from June 1977 to June 1981. Applicant worked as a liquid fuel systems 
maintenance technician for the Titan II missile program and held a top-secret security clearance without incident. In September 1980, while working at a Titan 
II missile site, Applicant went above and beyond the call of duty when he volunteered with others to assess damage to a missile in the silo. The missile, which 
reportedly contained a nuclear warhead, exploded destroying the silo, causing damage to the surrounding area, killing one servicemember, and injuring many 
others, including Applicant. He received second-degree burns on his face and second- and third-degree burns on his hands and fractured his ankle. For his 
actions, Applicant was decorated with the Airman's Medal for heroism and valor, and the medal was presented personally by the Secretary of the Air Force. 
The Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) has determined that Applicant's injuries justify a 50% disability rating. Applicant currently receives about $870 per 
month in disability compensation from the VA.</P> 
<P>The record evidence as a whole is sufficient to establish, by substantial evidence, the occurrence of all the factual events alleged in the SOR, except for those set 
forth in subparagraphs 1.e and 2.a. After both sides presented their cases, Department Counsel conceded on those allegations.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Accordingly, those matters are 
resolved in Applicant's favor and will not be discussed further.</P> 
<P>Concerning the indebtedness alleged in the SOR, the record evidence establishes Applicant  is indebted to four creditors (three delinquent accounts charged off 
as bad debts and a balance due after a voluntarily repossession of a car) for a total of nearly $17,000. It was also established that  Applicant has made essentially 
no payments to these four creditors. Applicant also has a paid money judgment for about $500 on his credit record.</P> 
<P>In addition to the indebtedness alleged in the SOR, Applicant owes approximately $750,000 in promissory notes to more than 200 creditors stemming from the 
business activities of his corporation from about June 1991 to September 1999. During this time, Applicant dedicated himself to launching and operating a 
business venture based on the idea of four dead palm trees that come to life as nonviolent action heros and role models for children. The business has produced  
various projects, e.g., a television pilot, a book, toys, life-size figures, etc., and it also has a web site. </P> 
<P>Although the business has enjoyed some success over the years, the present status is that it has no sales or marketing contracts in place, no operating capital, 
and the corporate checking account is depleted and shut down. The corporation was dissolved in 2000 for failure to pay annuals fees, but was reinstated in 2001 
when Applicant paid the fees from his salary. Applicant is still working to make the business a success and is paying business expenses from his personal 
accounts. Applicant is the president of the company and sole corporate officer. He acknowledges that he alone is responsible for corporate debt. His hope is that 
his business can achieve a significant breakthrough allowing him to pay off his personal and corporate debt. </P> 
<P>Aside from the indebtedness discussed above, Applicant and his family appear to be living within their means. </P> 
<P>Applicant presented a wealth of favorable character evidence from numerous people who vouch for his general character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
and security suitability.</P> 
<P>    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following adjudication guidelines are most 
pertinent here: Guideline F for financial considerations.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant 
has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against them.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline F. The record shows (1) a history of not meeting 
financial obligations, and (2) inability to satisfy debts.<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The delinquent accounts resulting in charged off bad debt, the repossession, the money judgment, and 
the $750,000 of debt stemming from his business support these conclusions. The same facts also show Applicant is overextended in the sense that, although 
living within his means, he is unable to make any progress on eliminating his overdue debt. At bottom, Applicant has no realistic or firm plan to resolve any of 
the indebtedness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline F and, given the record evidence, conclude none apply. Applicant attributes his difficult 
financial situation due to his "very unique situation"<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> involving his efforts to turn his idea of nonviolent action heros for children into a viable and financially 
successful business. Although Applicant's idea is unique, it is not particularly new or novel for an individual to experience severe financial problems when 
attempting to own and operate their own business. And so, I cannot give Applicant's unique circumstances much weight in mitigation or extenuation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also attempts to rely on the distinction between personal and corporate debt. Although it can be a valid distinction, it is not so here. The facts and 
circumstances show Applicant has effectively commingled his corporate operation with his personal finances rendering any distinction meaningless. This is 
especially true now since the business has no operating capital and he is financing any current operations from his personal funds. In short, it appears that 
"piercing the corporate veil"<A HREF="01-26479.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> would not be a difficult task given Applicant's situation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>To sum up under Guideline F, I assess the likelihood that Applicant will experience  continuing financial problems as probable. And I have weighed the record 
evidence--both favorable and unfavorable--and conclude the security concerns are not mitigated. Notwithstanding his honorable military service (notably, the 
Airman's Medal), and his other positive actions, attributes, and achievements, Applicant has not established, at this time, that it is "clearly consistent with the 
national interest" that he should be granted the privilege of a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>
