<P>Applicant's arms-length business transaction with his past employer did not violate any recognized code of professional responsibility, business ethics, or 
general moral code. Clearance granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 9 
September 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to a different Administrative Judge, but was 
reassigned to me on 8 January 2003 because of case load considerations, and received by me the same day. I set the case on 15 January 2003  and on 17 January 
2003 I issued a notice of hearing for 7 February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented six exhibits--three admitted without objection, one admitted over objection, and two excluded as stated below--and 
no witnesses; Applicant presented no exhibits--and the testimony of two witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 21 February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, I excluded Government's Exhibits 4 and 6 because they were sworn statements adverse to the Applicant on a controverted issue and thus 
inadmissible under the Directive, Paragraph E.3.1.22 (18-32). Although I admitted Government's Exhibit 5 as a business record otherwise required to be 
admitted in accordance with Directive, Paragraph E.3.1.20., I accord it less weight to the extent that it is based not on the direct observations of the 
investigating officers, but the recorded statements excluded as G.E. 4 and 6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 13 March 1998, Applicant entered into a proposed purchase contract for a piece of specialized equipment that would allow Applicant's company to perform 
required calibration on its machine products. The machine cost $10,000.00; the proposed date of sale was 17 March 1998 (G.E. 5). On 16 March 1998, 
Applicant was paid his company bonus for 1997, $24,000.00 less withholding (G.E. 5).<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> On 17 March 2003, Applicant purchased the machine. The same day, 
Applicant's company gave him a check for $24,000.00 for purchase of the machine (G.E. 5).<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On or about 19 May 1998, the company president confronted 
Applicant about the president's recent discovery that Applicant had paid $10,000.00 for the machine, not $24,000.00. The president demanded Applicant refund 
the $14,000.00 difference. Applicant refused and was fired. He later won his case for unemployment compensation before the state unemployment commission. 
However, he only collected one employment check as he was quickly hired by his current defense employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The company president accused Applicant of theft. The case was investigated (G.E. 3) and brought before a grand jury. Applicant testified before the grand 
jury, which refused to indict him. The company president did not testify at the first grand jury. He managed to get the prosecutors to reopen the case to permit 
him to testify. He testified at the second grand jury proceeding, Applicant did not. However, the grand jury still refused to indict Applicant.<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case hinges on the factual determination whether the $24,000.00 payment to Applicant was reimbursement for the putative price of the machine (with 
Applicant owing a fiduciary duty to the company to seek reimbursement only for the amount he actually paid) or an arms-length transaction between Applicant 
and his employer in which Applicant sold the machine (which he owned) to the company for a fair price. I find Applicant sold the machine he had purchased 
legitimately to his company at a fair price.<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations of the SOR. The SOR alleges a single incident as cognizable under both Guidelines F and E:</SPAN></P> 
<P>You engaged in deceptive financial practices by knowingly representing to your employer, [named], that the coordinate measuring machine you purchased for 
the company was in good working condition and cost $24,000.00 when in fact the machine did not work and cost $10,000.00. You did not pay back the 
$14,000.00 difference in price and you were subsequently terminated from your </P> 
<P>employment.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant vehemently denied the allegation in his answer:</SPAN></P> 
<P>I informed [named company owner] that I had found a Shieffeld Coordinate Measuring Machine and that I would like to purchase the machine and lease it to 
his company [named] Manufacturing Corp. This arrangement would give [the company] the utility of the machine without the burden of cash outlay for capital 
equipment and provide a tax deferment for myself. [Named company owner] was agreeable.</P> 
<P>After purchasing the coordinate measuring machine with my own money and making arrangements to have the machine delivered to [named] Corporation, I 
approached [Named company owner] to formalize a lease agreement. It was at this time that [named company owner] informed me he wanted to add a caveat 
too our previous agreement. The caveat would allow [named company owner] to exercise an option to purchase the machine at any time during the lease. I 
informed him that the purpose of the lease was to provide me a tax deferment, and that the caveat was not in my best interest and if his intent was to own the 
machine, I would sell it for $24,000.00, a fair market value. He did not hesitate in accepting my offer. He had a [named] Corporate check for $24,000.00 issued 
to [me] to purchase the coordinate machine. Two different [named] County Grand Juries found no probable cause that deceptive financial practices were 
committed by me. . .</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Although [named company owner] and I had a business dispute which eventually was resolved in my favor, my judgment has been reviewed by two properly 
empaneled grand juries and no  dishonesty, lack of candor, or deceptive financial practices were found on my behalf.</P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer is completely consistent with his 19 July 2000 sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS)(G.E. 2):</SPAN></P> 
<P>I was employed by [named] Manufacturing, [city, state], from March 96 to May 98, as General Manager. The owner of the company was [name]. The events 
that occurred that led to my termination are as follows.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I purchased a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) with my own money with the sole intent of leasing it to [named] Manufacturing. I purchased the machine 
from [another company] for $10,0000. After I had purchased the machine I was discussing the terms of the lease with [the owner] with the intent to get the 
terms and conditions in a written agreement. [The owner] wanted to add a caveat to our previous verbal agreement. The caveat being that he would have right to 
purchase the machine at any time. I responded that if he was interested in owning the machine then he could purchase it at that time. He had [company 
employee] write a check to me for $24,000.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Weeks later, after the machine had been delivered to [the company], and a separate office space had been remodeled to accommodate the machine, [the owner] 
became enraged when he discovered that I had profited from the sale. He demanded that I return the profits to him. I refused his demand and he terminated my 
employment.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>When I purchased the machine from [another company], I purchased the machine "as is" and knew that it was in good shape and had been properly 
disassembled, packaged, and protected. It did need certification and inspection after it was reassembled at [the company]. An employee later told me that it took 
about $100 to repair a feedback mechanism to get the machine back into working condition. I never misrepresented the condition or the age of the machine to 
[the owner] or any other employees of [the company].</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>[The owner] filed theft charges against me with the [city] Police Department alleging that I stole moneys. The case was forwarded to the [named] County 
District Attorneys Office, [city, state]. A grand jury heard the case and "No Billed" the case. [The owner] appealed the decision, because he was not available to 
give his testimony. An appeal was granted  and a new grand jury was convened and heard. The case and the second grand jury was again "No Billed".</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>In addition to the above circumstance, [the owner] initially denied my claim for unemployment compensation. I appealed the denial and there was a tribunal 
hearing convened between an attorney of fact for the State of Texas Employment Commission, [the owner] and myself. The outcome of the hearing was that the 
[state] Employment Commission ruled in my favor for unemployment compensation.</P> 
<P>I have never hid the circumstances concerning my termination from [the company] from any employers or on my security questionnaire. My current employer 
and supervisors are aware of the circumstances. [The owner] called [my current company], Government Affairs Office after I began my employment and made 
allegations about the circumstances concerning my dismissal from [the company]. I believe he was trying to cause problems for me, I don't know what was said 
but I believe the intent was to cause problems for me.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>To the best of my knowledge there have not been any other actions or civil matters concerning my dismissal from [the company]. The situation with my 
termination from [the company] does not in anyway make me susceptible to blackmail or coercion concerning classified information.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 28 September 1998, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) on which he truthfully disclosed the circumstances of his 
termination from the manufacturing company.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks reinstatement of the access to classified information that he previously had with this 
employer. He is a machinist by rearing, a businessman by education (Tr. 161-164).<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before Applicant went to work for the company that is the focus of the SOR, he was employed to manage a company coming out of bankruptcy. Applicant had 
been employed by the company owners when the bankruptcy judge would not let them come out of bankruptcy unless the company was being run as efficiently 
as possible. Applicant turned the company around to the point where it was making a profit.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The owner of Applicant's learned of his success and wanted to hire Applicant to perform similar work for his company. The owner was a prominent state 
legislator whose nominal job was running his manufacturing company. The company owned no capital assets. It rented the building it occupied, as well as all its 
manufacturing equipment, from the owner. It was losing money, and had been losing money for some time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was reluctant to go to work for this company, but finally agreed to become the general manager; his compensation package provided he would be 
paid a bonus in any month when the company made money, with a year-end bonus of 15% based on net profits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant went to work for the company, he discovered--contrary to the owner's claims--that the company essentially did not have any contracts for 
machine parts, and had fallen off the list of approved vendors for those defense-contract buyers who had previously provided the company with work. 
Nevertheless, Applicant turned the company around to where it was making money, and at the end of 1997, the company owed Applicant $24,000.00 in bonus 
money.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant wanted to invest the bonus in a way that would provide tax benefits to him. At the same time the company's business was growing and they need 
specialized equipment to calibrate the machine products they made so they could be certified for sale to the defense-contract buyers. Those certifications were 
available on a piece rate (prohibitively expensive) or by leasing a less satisfactory piece of equipment for $500.00 per month, the lowest rate Applicant was able 
to find.  However, Applicant found a more comprehensive piece of equipment that had been surplussed by another manufacturing company. Because of 
Applicant's expertise in manufacturing, he knew the equipment had been well-maintained and properly packaged for storage. He also knew the asking price 
($10,000.00) was a below-market bargain.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He approached the owner of his company about buying the equipment himself and leasing it to the company (for $500.00 per month). Given his past dealings 
with the owner, he had no reason to believe the owner wanted to buy the equipment himself or have the company buy it. The owner was originally agreeable to 
Applicant's proposal and paid Applicant his bonus so he could buy the equipment. However, when Applicant went to formalize the lease, the owner wanted a 
provision that would give him the right to purchase the machine from Applicant at any time during the lease. Applicant was unwilling to give up his 
contemplated tax benefits of owning the equipment, but offered to sell the equipment for a price he thought would provide a reasonable profit on his purchase, 
given that he would lose the income-producing potential of the machine. The owner quickly agreed to Applicant's asking price of $24,000.00. He never asked 
Applicant what Applicant had paid for the machine. Not until the owner learned that Applicant paid $10,000.00 for the machine did the owner become 
incensed, demanding "refund" of the excess "reimbursement." He retaliated as described above. He did not, however, pursue any civil action against Applicant. 
The company never made money again, and is now out of business (Tr. 253).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's expert witness testified credibly that Applicant had violated no business ethics or moral code in his transaction with the owner of the company and 
that Applicant had engaged in an arms-length transaction by selling a capital asset to the company for a fair price given his acquisition costs and his prospective 
loss of income from the lease of the machine to the company (Tr. 183-251).<A HREF="01-15837.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The government produced no code of professional responsibility, business ethics, 
or general moral code violated by Applicant's conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.2. Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing 
deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of trust;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.1. The behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.2. It was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.1. Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability;</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has not established its case under guideline F. To conclude that it had, I would have to accept the version of the transaction contained in G.E. 
3, which I do not. The facts described in G.E. 3 cannot be reconciled with Applicant's more credible version.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was a professional machinist in the process of making his company into a profitable business. He had succeeded, as evidenced by his bonus, and had 
every intention of making more money both for himself and the company. He knew the company owned no capital assets and the owner was unwilling to tie up 
more of his money in capital assets for the company. He also knew the company would require the use of calibrating equipment if it was to continue to grow. 
He found a suitable piece of equipment in good condition that would do a better job than the lowest-priced alternate and saw an opportunity to help himself and 
the company. He discussed his plan with the owner who agreed: Applicant would buy the machine and lease it to the company for the same monthly cost as the 
quote for the less-satisfactory machine. Applicant would get the income from the lease, as well as the tax advantage of depreciating the machine. The company 
would get a better piece of equipment for the same money and continue its growth. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The owner changed the terms of the agreement before it could be reduced to writing, and Applicant preferred to sell the machine outright rather than give the 
owner an option to buy. The owner readily agreed to the asking price without inquiring about the equipment. His retaliatory actions after discovering what 
Applicant paid for the machine bespeak frustration at being outsmarted or outmanuevered in an arms-length business transaction and having the means as a 
state legislator to make more than a little trouble for Applicant. None of this obscures the fact that the original lease proposed by Applicant was a good deal for 
the company or the fact that the sale price on what amounted to a compelled sale was fair given Applicant's income and tax expectations. Applicant considers 
himself a straight-shooter, and I found him to be so in his testimony. He violated no ethical standard know to me, known to Department Counsel, known to the 
expert, nor any cited to me by any of the parties or witnesses. There was nothing about the transaction that was either illegal or deceptive. Accordingly, I resolve 
Guideline F. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, the government has not established its case under Guideline E. Applicant engaged in no unethical or immoral conduct in his business 
dealings with his employer. I resolve Guideline E. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996, and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant was employed on a contract where he was paid only if the company made money, $1,000.00 per month plus a year-end bonus of 15% of net 
income. The bonus was due in January 1998, but not paid because of the company's financial situation. The original check stub contains notations showing that 
the check was for Applicant's bonus, less withholding. A hand-written notation on the photocopy of the check (but not on the original four-corners of the check 
and stub) reflects "bonus check." However, there is no evidence when that notation was made. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>The check stub indicates only that the check was for the machine at issue. A hand-written notation on the photocopy of the check (but not on the original four-corners of the check and stub) reflects "reimbursement for CMM." However, there is no evidence when that notation was made either. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>The above facts are essentially undisputed. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>The only evidence to the contrary is G.E. 3. I give this evidence less weight for a number of reasons. First, the evidence against Applicant consists almost 
exclusively of the hearsay statements--filtered through the investigating officers--of the complaining witnesses, including the company president, whose 
statements were excluded under Paragraph E.3.1.22. Each of those witnesses had a vested interest in supporting the story of the company president and owner, 
whose goodwill they needed to stay employed. Second, the version of the transaction contained in G.E. 3 has been rejected--implicitly or explicitly--by two 
grand juries and a state unemployment commission. Both grand juries would have had access to more evidence than was produced at this hearing; one of them 
had the president's live testimony subject to cross-examination, something missing here. Third, Applicant's version of events is more consistent with the  
documentary evidence of the transaction (the checks and sales contract) than is G.E. 3. I give no weight whatsoever to the handwritten annotations on either of 
the two checks. Were I to give them any weight, I would find them evidence of the owner's attempt to make the record comport with his version of the 
transaction and not reflective of the actual facts.

tried to run a plant.

not meet Applicant until the day of the hearing and had no knowledge of the particulars of the case until Applicant's counsel retained him to review the record 
(Tr. 189). Second, Applicant's counsel prepared the expert by having him read all the government's exhibits first before giving him the Applicant's side of the 
case (Tr. 240-241).  Finally, the expert had the opportunity--as did I--of observing Applicant's testimony at the hearing and finding it credible  (Tr. 243-250).
