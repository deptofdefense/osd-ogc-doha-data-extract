<P>Applicant, age 50, has a history of three alcohol related traffic arrests since 1982. Notwithstanding the recommendations of two clinical social workers to 
abstain from alcohol use, Applicant continues to drink, and did so during his most recent treatment program. Applicant has failed to mitigate serious questions 
about his security eligibility and suitability. Clearance is denied.</P>

</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not find that it is clearly in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated February 10, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a  file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was 
received by Applicant  on August 3, 2004. Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation 
by September 2, 2004. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit anything further in his own behalf. The case was assigned to me on January 
14, 2005. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted all nine factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption under Guideline G as stated in the SOR. These admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor working as a millwright, and has held his current security clearance was dated February 4, 1991.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>He 
is a divorced father of two grown children. One 7-year-old child died in a drowning accident.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. He began drinking as a teenager and as a result of such abuse was arrested three times for driving under the 
influence.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> As a result of such abuse he was first arrested on February 25, 1982, and charged with driving while intoxicated with blood alcohol content of .30. 
He pled guilty to a reduced charge of driving while impaired, paid a fine, was given a conditional discharge and ordered to and did complete the state's  
Drinking Driver Program.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On May 12, 1995, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated with blood alcohol content of .12, and subsequently pled guilty to a reduced charge of 
driving while ability impaired. He paid a fine and received a conditional discharge.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>On May 26, 1995, Applicant was evaluated by another (CSW) who recommended an outpatient alcohol education class for periodic alcohol abuse.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He 
participated in an outpatient alcohol assessment program from July 10, 1995 to September 13, 1995, and at the completion of the alcohol program was re-evaluated as having episodic alcohol abuse.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on April 3, 2002 for driving while intoxicated with blood alcohol content of .15. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a fine, conditional 
discharge, and his license was suspended for 90 days.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant voluntarily was  evaluated by a third CSW who recommended he abstain from drinking alcoholic beverages, attend an outpatient program and 
participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He received treatment from June 24, 2002 to October 22, 2002, attended weekly individual and group counseling 
sessions, and was found to be alcohol dependent.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant continued to consume alcoholic beverages during this period.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Notwithstanding the evaluation of alcohol dependence, Applicant continues to 
consume intoxicating beverages.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG></STRONG>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case.  Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive: 
nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, 
and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of 
rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating 
condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be 
measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the SOR 
allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed 
under Guideline G (alcohol consumption).</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an Applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The government bears an initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">prima facie </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.1. 
One who shows he cannot manage the intoxicating effects of alcohol in a responsible manner may be prone to inadvertent disclosures of sensitive or classified 
information. Such conduct may also indicate a more general lack of trustworthiness or good judgment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel has presented sufficient evidence to establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline G. The Applicant has a 20-year 
history of alcohol related incidents and arrest. The arrest records, the evaluations by CSWs, as well as the Applicant's own admissions in the Answer, and his 
sworn statement to the Defense Security Service, fully support the SOR allegations. The following Guideline G disqualifying conditions apply. Directive, &para; 
E2.A7.1.2.1. <EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or their criminal incidents 
related to alcohol use</EM>; Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.2.4. <EM>Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member 
of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>; and Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.2.5. <EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's position in his 2002 statement is that " . . . my use of alcohol has not changed since my last statement [1995] concerning a similar issue. My use of 
alcohol has not affected me financially and it has not affected my job performance or my health. I do not feel that I have a drinking problem and no one has 
criticized my drinking habits. I have been through counseling following other incidents involving alcohol and I have never been found to have an alcohol 
dependence."<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> This is not true.  Applicant has expended money to hire lawyers to defend his DWI arrests, he has paid fines, court costs and costs associated 
with CSW evaluations and alcohol treatment programs.<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The fact that he continues to consume intoxicating beverages after these treatment programs,<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> that he 
continued to drink during these programs and continues to drink notwithstanding the recommendation of his third CSW evaluation that he abstain from alcohol, 
leads me to conclude that Applicant remains in a state of denial.  The fact that he drank to excess after completing two treatment programs<A HREF="03-10649.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> further undermines 
my confidence that Applicant's drinking will not be a problem in the future.  I also find that Applicant has failed to satisfy any of four mitigating conditions. I 
conclude Guideline G against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence. And I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating condition as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 6.3, as called for by a fair and commonsense assessment of the 
record before me as required by Directive</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; E2.2.3. These facts raise reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to 
exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve those 
doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</SPAN></P>
