</P>

<P>	On September 9, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to ------------------ (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 3, 1996. The case was received
by the undersigned on February 10, 1997. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 16, 1997, and
the hearing was held on February 26, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Applicant is a thirty-four year old divorced man. He is employed as a firefighter by a defense
contractor.</P>

<P>	Applicant consumed alcohol to excess with varying frequency from approximately 1978 to
November 1995.</P>

<P>	In May 1983, he was arrested and charged with Driving While Under the Influence (DWI).
He pleaded guilty to the charge, was fined $800.00-$900.00, and ordered to attend an alcohol
awareness class. Applicant attended the alcohol awareness class as ordered.</P>

<P>	In June 1983, he was stopped for a traffic violation. He passed a field sobriety test and was
released.</P>

<P>	In April 1989, DOHA issued applicant an SOR that alleged he was ineligible for a security
clearance because of his alcohol and drug use. Following an August 1989 hearing, the
Administrative Judge issued a decision favorable to applicant, and in January 1990, he was granted
a security clearance (G-10).</P>

<P>	Applicant continued to consume alcohol, on "a rare occasion" to the point of intoxication,
after the 1989 DOHA hearing.  In 1993, he and his wife separated. The separation left applicant
lonely and depressed, and to cope with these feelings he increased his alcohol consumption. This
increased alcohol consumption became a concern to his family, and in June 1995, they persuaded
him to get an alcohol evaluation. The alcohol evaluation resulted in a tentative diagnosis of "alcohol
dependence - DSM-IV Code 303.91" (Exhibit 10). Despite this evaluation, applicant did not take
any steps to deal with his alcohol problem. </P>

<P>	On August 20, 1995,<A HREF="96-0499.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> applicant was arrested and charged with DWI.<A HREF="96-0499.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> The  attorney he
retained to defend him referred him for another alcohol evaluation. The October 19, 1995 evaluation
concluded that applicant is a "late early stage alcoholic" (G-30). On December 11, 1995, the court
placed applicant in a two year deferred prosecution program. In order to get accepted into this
program, applicant had to agree to accept two years of alcohol counseling. Applicant completed the
first phase of the counseling, consisting of eight weeks in an Intensive Outpatient Program and eight
weeks in a Sobriety Maintenance Program, on February 28, 1996 (G-14). Since March 7, 1996, he
has participated in the outpatient follow up phase of the treatment program, and will continue to do
so through November 1997. A January 1997 letter from applicant's probation officer (G-15)
corroborates applicant's testimony that he has complied with the alcohol counseling requirements
of the deferred prosecution program.</P>

<P>	In addition to the formal alcohol counseling he is receiving, applicant has been attending two
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per week since November 1995. He acquired an AA sponsor
and has completed all twelve steps of the AA program. He testified, credibly, that he intends to
continue attending AA. He further testified that he has abstained from the use of alcohol since
November 1995, and intends to remain abstinent. Now that he is living a clean and sober lifestyle
he feels better about himself both physically and mentally (TR at 99).</P>

<P>	Applicant's current chemical dependency counselor appeared at the hearing and testified that
based on the "attitude" and "sincerity" applicant has shown, his prognosis for recovery is "good"
(TR at 51).</P>

<P><CENTER></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant used marijuana a few times a year from the late 1970s to July 1995. He purchased
it on a few occasions during this time. He used cocaine on two occasions in the 1980s, the last time
in 1987.</P>

<P>	In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the Defense Investigative Service in February
1989 (G-4), applicant stated he did "not enjoy smoking (marijuana) enough to jeopardize (his) career
over it," and did "not intend to use it in the future." During the aforementioned August 1989 DOHA
hearing, applicant testified that he did not intend to use marijuana again (TR at 134).  Despite these
statements, applicant used marijuana after the 1989 hearing, the last time in July 1995.</P>

<P>Applicant testified that when he stated in 1989 he did not intend to use marijuana again he meant
it. As to why he did not follow through with his stated intention to abstain, applicant testified that
each time he used marijuana he was consuming alcohol and "wasn't using (his) head like (he) should
have been" (TR at 132-133). When asked how he could be sure he would not use marijuana again,
applicant replied that he no longer consumes alcohol and stays away from friends that use it.</P>

<P>		</P>

<P>	A fellow firefighter appeared at the hearing and testified on applicant's behalf. He testified
that he has worked with applicant since 1988, at times as applicant's supervisor, and that to his
knowledge applicant has not had any substance abuse-related problems at work. He further testified
that applicant performs well at his job.</P>

<P>	Letters from various individuals acquainted with applicant, including coworkers, supervisors
and friends, were admitted in evidence. These letters establish that applicant is considered to be a
reliable and trustworthy individual.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that reasonably
suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information. If the Government
meets its burden, it has established a <FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. Once the Government establishes a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima
facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, the burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation, extenuation, mitigation
or reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the Government's </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, he
or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the Directive's requirement
that a security clearance be granted only upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the
national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</FONT></P>

<P>	In this case, the Government established a <FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. The evidence establishes that
applicant (1) consumed alcohol to excess with varying frequency from approximately 1978 to
November 1995, (2) used cocaine twice in the 1980s,</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> and (3) used marijuana a few times a year 
from the late 1970s to July 1995. This consumption of alcohol to excess and abuse of illegal drugs,
particularly after his 1989 DOHA hearing, reflects adversely on applicant's judgment, reliability and
trustworthiness, and reasonably suggests that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified
information for at least two reasons:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	First, individuals granted access to classified information are responsible for safeguarding
it twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, on and off the job. An applicant who consumes
alcohol to excess, or uses illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, cannot be relied upon to meet
his or her security responsibilities because the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information through neglect or inattention while intoxicated or "high" is too great. Second, applicant
used marijuana for many years with full knowledge that each time he used it he was breaking the
law. This suggests that applicant may be unwilling to abide by security regulations if he finds them
in conflict with his personal wishes or desires.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Clearly, if applicant had not offered substantial credible evidence that he has reformed, he
would not be eligible for a security clearance. The fact that he continued to consume alcohol to
excess and use marijuana after his earlier DOHA hearing is a very serious matter that strongly
militates against continuing his security clearance. However, after considering all of the evidence
presented, I conclude that applicant has reformed and can now be relied upon to safeguard classified
information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Although applicant was in denial about his chemical dependency for a very long time, he was
finally forced to confront his addiction following his second DWI arrest in 1995. Regardless of his
motive in accepting the deferred prosecution deal, the evidence establishes that applicant's
participation in the required alcohol counseling has been successful. In addition to finally accepting
the fact that he is alcohol dependent, he understands that he must completely abstain from the use
of alcohol, and recognizes that he will need to remain active in AA if he is to remain abstinent. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">These
facts, together with his fifteen months of abstinence and his chemical dependency counselor's
opinion that his chances for recovery are good, lead me to</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> conclude that in all likelihood applicant's
consumption of alcohol and abuse of marijuana will not recur. For this reason, Criteria G, H and E
are found for applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>      The court record  indicates the arrest took place on August 20, 1995 (G-28). However, there is conflicting
evidence on this point.  <U>See</U>, e.g., Exhibits 3, 9, 10, 13, 28, and 30.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>      Applicant was also charged with refusing to submit to a breathalyser, which resulted in the suspension of
his drivers license. However, a Hearing Officer subsequently ruled that applicant did not refuse the test, and
reinstated his licence (G-33).
