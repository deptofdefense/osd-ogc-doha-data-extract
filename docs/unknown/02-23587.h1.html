<P>Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the U.S. from Laos in 1994.  She and her husband (also a naturalized U.S. citizen from Laos) claim 
allegiance only to the U.S. and have two children who are US citizens by birth. Applicant continues to maintain regular contact with her parents who are 
citizens and residents of Laos and provide small financial support to each of them.  She also has six siblings who are citizens and residents of Laos and 
extended family members (her husband and father-in-law) who are naturalized citizens of the U.S. from Laos.  None of Applicant's immediate and extended 
family members are agents of the Laos government or in a position to be exploited or pressured.  Applicant mitigates any potential risk to undue foreign

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On April 28, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on November 19, August 15, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was 
furnished the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 25, 2004, and received it on March 9, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 
days provided him with supplemental documentation regarding his finances.   The case was assigned to me April 28, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have parents who are citizens and residents of Laos with whom she has close bonds of affection, (b) have three 
siblings who are citizens and residents of Laos, (c) have a father-in-law who was a major in the Royal Lao Army from 1956 to 1975 and (d) send up to 
$1,000.00 per year to her parents to help them when they experience times of hardship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, subject to explanations.  She claimed she wanted to help her parents live a decent life 
and her siblings pursue their education and attain good professional jobs and a higher standard of education.  She claimed her father was a major in the Royal 
Laos Army until the Communists took control of the county in 1975 and placed him in a concentration camp, pending his release in 1985 and ensuing 
emigration to the U.S. in 1986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 33-year-old wirer for a defense contractor who seeks to obtain a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's background</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born and raised in Laos to Laotian parents and immigrated to the U.S. around 1994.  She applied for U.S. citizenship soon after her arrival in the 
U.S. and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999.  Applicant and her husband claim the US as their only country of allegiance (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4) and have two 
children, both of whom are US. citizens.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are citizens who currently reside in Laos.  She retains close bonds of affection with her parents and maintains regular contact with them.  
She assists them by sending them $1,000.00 a year to help them through periods of hardship.  Applicant has three brothers and three sisters who are citizens and 
residents of Laos.  Her father-in-law, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, was a major in the Royal Laos Army from 1954 until the Communist takeover in 1975, 
when he was placed in a concentration camp.  He was released from the camp in 1985 in Thailand, where he lived in a refugee camp, until he immigrated to the 
U.S.1986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of applicant's immediate and extended family members have been identified as agents of the Lao government or persons in a position to be exploited, 
compromised, or pressured by agents or officials of the Lao government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Country Status of Laos</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Laos is regarded by the US State Department as a poor but developing with a socialist authoritarian government.  <EM>See Consular Information Sheet issued by 
U.S. State Department</EM> (February 2004).  Political power is centralized in the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.  American tourists traveling to Laos are advised 
to exercise caution and be vigilant about their personal security.  Lao security personnel are known to place foreign visitors under surveillance.   Less developed 
countries like Laos are known to be collectors of technology and proprietary data: notably manufacturing processes, information technology (both software and 
hardware), and financial information.  <EM>See Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage - 2002 </EM>(NCIX February 
2003).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members, co-habitant or associate  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security issues of concern to the Government  focus primarily on the status of Applicant's parents (who currently receive about $1,000.00 a year from 
Applicant) and siblings who are citizens and residents of Laos.   Security concerns also extend to Applicant's father-in-law (a former major in the Royal Lao 
Army) who is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because members of Applicant's immediate and extended family are current or former Laos citizens who reside either in Laos or the U.S., they present 
potential security risks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The citizenship/residence status of 
these relatives in Laos and the U.S., respectively, pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could 
compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From what is known from the accounts of Applicant, neither her spouse and family members nor any of her immediate family members holding Laos 
citizenship and residence (<EM>viz., </EM>her parents and six siblings) have any affiliations or connections with the Laos government, have any history to date of being 
subjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Applicant, her husband, and his father, all  demonstrated considerable courage 
and resolve when they immigrated to the U.S. to find better lives.  By Applicant's accounts, she has become completely dedicated to preserving U.S. political 
and economic interests here and can be expected to resist any potential pressure that might be exerted on any of her family members residing either in the U.S. 
or in Laos.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Laos, although still controlled by a authoritarian socialist government, which lacks any demonstrated respect for human rights and the rule of law by most 
published accounts, still continues to maintain diplomatic interests with the U.S.  In balance, though, Laos must be considered a country neither allied with  nor 
accommodating to U.S. political and economic interests.  Laos remains a country of considerable security concern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are 
citizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign 
influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied materials and country 
information about Laos through the materials accepted in the record through official notice.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's immediate family members in Laos, and extended family members being expatriates of 
Laos, any risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data 
out of Applicant, while still extant, must be discounted in the face of the absence of any evidence of connections to the Lao government by any of Applicant's 
family members still residing in Laos, or identifiable risk of exploitation, pressure, or compromise by officials of the Lao government.  No such risks of 
compromise have been linked either to Applicant's father-in-law, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Lao and former Lao Army major.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the possibility of Applicant's succumbing to pressure from Laos authorities to ensure her parents financial and personal well being is speculative.  
To date, none of her parents or siblings have made any visible attempt to enlist Applicant's assistance in responding to any political pressures (real or 
suspected), and none should be assumed without some tangible request for assistance.  Any financial interests Applicant  may have invested in her parents 
appear to be quite minimal (no more than $1,000.00 a year) and create no manifest security risk.  Piecemeal analysis has, of course, been consistently rejected 
by the Appeal Board when assessing the security risks posed by an applicant's family members residing in a foreign country.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-22693 
(September 22, 2003).  Applicant may invoke the mitigation benefits of MC 1 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(a determination that the immediate family members, co-habitant or associate are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
persons involved and the United States). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Overall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's immediate family members (<EM>viz., </EM>her parents, siblings) who are citizens and residents of 
Laos, and father-in-law by dint of his prior military service in Laos, are mitigated sufficiently to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to 
withstand risks of undue influence attributable to her relationships with family members in Laos, or formerly of Laos.  Favorable conclusions warrant with 
respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS and CONDITIONS listed above, I 
make the following separate FORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
