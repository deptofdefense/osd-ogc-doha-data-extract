<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">clearance for Applicant.  On April 5, 2005, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="04-06208.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-06208.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 25, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June 
27, 2005.  On August 26, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. At the hearing, the Government offered five exhibits, which were identified as Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5 and entered  in the record 
without objection.  Applicant presented no exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on September 13, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct. Three allegations relate to conduct addressed by Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and two 
allegations relate to conduct addressed by  Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the omissions alleged under 
Guideline E of the Directive, but denied his answers were knowingly and willfully false.  He admitted two allegations under Guideline J.  His admissions are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 25 years old and seeks a security clearance for his job as a project control analyst with a government contractor.  Applicant is unmarried and has no 
children.  He lives with his maternal grandmother.  (Tr. 29; 107.)  He is a high school graduate, and he attended a state university for two years and a 
community college for 1&frac12; years.  (Tr. 30-31.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2004, Applicant's employer suspended him until the issue of his security clearance could be resolved.  (Tr. 33-38.)  He has supported himself in part 
since then by doing odd jobs for his grandmother and neighbors.  (Tr. 106.)  He was also employed at a fast food chain and earned $6 to $7 an hour.  He stopped 
working at the fast food chain because he was "tired of working" there. (Tr. 126-127.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From approximately April 2000 to April 2001, Applicant lived in an apartment with a girl friend.  The lease to the apartment was in the girl friend's name.  (Tr. 
42; 95.)  In January 2001, the girl friend invited a friend of hers, another young woman, to stay in the apartment.  When the young woman arrived, she brought 
some of her belongings with her.  Applicant reported the young woman brought clothing, a radio, a DVD player, and a large jewelry chest, which he estimated 
weighed about 70 pounds. (Tr. 45-48.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The young woman moved out of the apartment in approximately March 2001.  According to Applicant, she took all of her possessions except the jewelry chest, 
which he said contained a ring.  Applicant said his girl friend called the young woman several times to ask to her to come and retrieve her ring, but was 
unsuccessful in reaching her. (Tr. 25.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2001, Applicant and his girl friend moved from the apartment and went to live in separate locations.  When they left the apartment, they left the young 
woman's jewelry box on the sidewalk.  (Tr. 46-49.)  Applicant kept the young woman's ring and pawned it without her permission in October 2001. He 
received $150 for the ring, which was valued at $1,900. (Ex. 3, at 3.)  Applicant said he pawned the ring to obtain money for rent. (Ex. 2, at 3.)  He defended his 
conduct by saying the young woman had "abandoned" her ring. (Tr. 52; 77-78.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The young woman learned Applicant had pawned her ring without her permission and reported this information to the police.  In February 2003, Applicant was 
arrested.  He appeared with counsel in court in March 2003 and was charged with felony theft.  The case was put on the court's "stet" docket because the 
complainant did not appear.  (Ex. 3; Tr.54-58; 109.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2003 Applicant and a male friend were riding in the friend's new car.  Police  stopped the car when they discovered the tags on the car were stolen.  
They searched the car and found a bag containing approximately 20 grams of marijuana.  Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana.  
(Tr. 65.)  He was represented by counsel and appeared in court to answer charges in March 2003.  The case was placed on the "stet" docket for one year and 
Applicant was awarded a week of community service.  (Ex. 4; Tr. 65-67; 109.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Six months later, in September 2003, Applicant was hired by a government contractor and asked to complete a security clearance application  (SF-86).  
Applicant completed and certified his SF-86 on September 15, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 21 on the SF-86 asks applicants if they have "ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense."  Applicant answered "yes" to Question 21 
and listed a case in which he had been found to be an innocent victim of identity theft.  In his response, he provided such specific details as his prison number, 
the docket number of the case, the name of the chief judge, and the date of the adjudicative hearing.  (Tr. 75-76.)  He failed to list his February 2003 arrest and 
felony theft charge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 24 on the SF-86 asks if an applicant has ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses(s) related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant responded "no" 
to Question 24 and failed to list his February, 2003 possession of marijuana charge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Item 43, identified as the General Remarks section of the SF-86, Applicant stated he had no contacts with childhood friends and had therefore "used [his] 
family's information" when he responded to Question 7 on the SF-86.  Question 7 asked the applicant to provide the names and addresses of "People Who 
Know You Well."  At his hearing, Applicant stated that two of the three  people he listed in response to Item 43 were family members.  He further indicated he 
had no friends who knew him well.  (Tr. 91-92.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by a investigator of  the Defense Security Service on November 14, 2003.  In a signed, sworn statement, he admitted the marijuana 
possession charge and pawning the young woman's ring without her permission.  (Ex. 4.)  In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the felony theft charge but 
denied he had stolen the ring from the young woman.  At his hearing he asserted his conduct was not criminal because the young woman had "abandoned" her 
ring when she left the apartment.  (Tr. 52.)  He also admitted the possession of marijuana charge but denied knowing his friend had marijuana in the car.  
Applicant admitted he did not include the felony theft charge in his response to Question 21 of the SF-86.  He also admitted falsifying his answer to Question 
24 on the SF-86 by denying he had ever been charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs.  He claimed he thought placing criminal charges on a "stet" 
docket rendered the charges null and thus he was under no requirement to report them. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant signed and dated certifications when he completed his SF-86 on September 15, 2003, and when he gave his written statement to the Defense Security 
Service investigator on November 14, 2003.  Those certifications read as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I certify that the following statement is true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good faith.  I understand that a 
knowing and willful false statement can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was charged with felonious theft (&para; 1.a.) and possession of marijuana (&para; 1.b.)  Additionally, DOHA alleged under 
Guideline J that Applicant deliberately falsified his SF-86 by failing to report the criminal charges in his responses to Questions 21 and 24 and that these 
omissions constituted felonious criminal conduct under section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code. (&para; 1.c.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Disqualifying conditions include allegations 
or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged  (&para; E2.A10.1.2.1.), and a single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses (&para; E2.A10.1.2.2.).  Applicant admitted the criminal conduct alleged by the Government in &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR, which raises security concerns 
under&para; E2.A10.1.2.1. and &para; E2.A10.1.2.2. of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns under Guideline J recognize that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant 
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted felony theft and marijuana possession occurred in 2001 and 2003.  These criminal acts were recent, and they were not isolated events.  
They demonstrate a pattern of criminal conduct.  Thus,  the mitigating conditions at &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1. and E2.A10.1.3.2 of Guideline J do not apply in this case 
and the allegations at &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the criminal conduct alleged by the Government in &para; 1.c. of the SOR.  He  admitted falsifying his answers to Questions 21 and 24 on his SF-86, but denied his falsifications were deliberate.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record reflects that Applicant completed his responses to certain items on his SF-86 with apparent punctiliousness and care.  In his response to Question 21 
on the SF-86, he identified his only criminal conduct as being the unfortunate victim of the crime of  identity theft.  He cited the specifics of the adjudication 
that found him innocent, thereby inviting close scrutiny.  At the same time, he failed to reveal that he had been arrested and charged with felony theft and that 
this charge had been adjudicated only six months earlier, in March 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to Question 24 on the SF-86, Applicant denied ever being charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs, even though he had 
been arrested and charged with possession of marijuana in March 2003.  Applicant was also careful to point out in the General Remarks section that he had no 
childhood friends or contemporaries who could be identified as people who knew him well and contacted by investigators for information about him.  Of the 
three names he provided of people who knew him well, two were family members.  Applicant's conduct in filling out his SF-86 by reporting some information 
in great detail and completely omitting other material facts suggests a lack of good faith </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he completed his SF-86, Applicant signed and dated the following statement:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My statements on this form, an any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States 
Code)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, it is a felony to make a writing or document, knowing it contains a materially false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statement.  Applicant is a high school graduate and has several years of college education.  The record reflects he has a clear knowledge of language 
and knew what he certifying with his signature on the SF-86.  He offered no credible evidence to rebut the Government's allegation that his falsifications on his 
SF-86 were knowing and willful and deliberate.  Accordingly, the SOR allegation at &para; 1.c. is concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E,  Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, when he failed to list his February 13, 2002 felony charge in his 
Answer to Question 21 on his SF-86 (&para; 2.a.) and when he denied and failed to list his February 2003 possession of marijuana charge in response Question 24 on 
the SF-86 (&para; 2.b.).  Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  The Government established and Applicant admitted that 
he had omitted, concealed and falsified relevant and material facts from his personnel security questionnaire.  &para; E2.A5.1.2.2.  His concealment of information 
he considered embarrassing or professionally damaging could make him vulnerable to coercion and blackmail.  &para;E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises additional 
concerns under E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests 
that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: The information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily. &para;E.2.A.5.1.3.2.  Applicant acknowledged the correct information when confronted by an investigator  of the Defense Security 
Service in November 2003.  His falsifications are recent, and they are not isolated incidents.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR 
are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P>
