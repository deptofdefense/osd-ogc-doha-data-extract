<P>Applicant has a history of bankruptcy (discharged in 1998) followed by additionally incurred delinquent debts  between 1998 and 2002 during periods of 
intermittent underemployment and unemployment while under a medical disability, child support burdens, and family medical expenses.  The listed unpaid 
debts exceed $15,000.00, and are compounded by a subsequent deficiency on a vehicle repossession in 2002.  His delinquent debts remain significant with still

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 24, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on September 9, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 8, 2004, and was scheduled for 
hearing on November 30, 2004.  A hearing was convened on November 30, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant 
relied on two witnesses (including himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on December 7, 2004.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to enable him to supplement the record with payment documentation and the 
way Applicant makes payment on the home purchased by his father in Applicant's behalf. There being no objection from the Government, and good cause 
being demonstrated, Applicant was granted additional time to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with 
exhibits pertaining to his debts, military discharges, payment arrangements with his father-in-law, medical disability benefits award from the VA, and accrued 
family medical expenses, which were accepted as Applicant's exhibits I through R.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated delinquent debts with eight different creditors, that exceed $16,000.00 and include two 
creditors who repossessed vehicles belonging to Applicant and (b) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 1998, listing assets of $5,900.00 and liabilities 
of $46,373.33, and receiving his bankruptcy discharge in November 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, save for his being  indebted on a repossessed vehicle in April 2002.  He provided no 
explanations for any of his answers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 34-year-old training specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR, and admitted to by 
Applicant, are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After completing one four-year tour of active duty with the Army in 1992, Applicant re-enlisted and later received a medically-related discharge in May 2000.   
Before his military discharge in May 2000, Applicant and his first wife (W1) encountered marital difficulties and initiated divorce proceedings.  Delinquent in 
their debts, facing monthly child support payments, and unable to agree on any allocation plan for dividing their debts, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection in August 1998, listing assets of $5,900.00 and liabilities of $46,373.33 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 41-42), and was granted a general discharge in November 
1998.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After completing his joint bankruptcy, Applicant hoped to get a fresh start with his finances. Instead, he became involved in a service-related accident that 
required treatment for back and ankle injuries.  His medical problems resulted in increased non-covered medical expenses that only compounded his continuing 
financial problems. Uncertain at the time what disability rating Applicant would be assigned by VA, the Army granted him an advance just after his medical 
discharge (in July 2000) of $48,081.60, which it characterized as severance pay (<EM>see</EM> ex. P; R.T., at 53).   Following his discharge, the VA conducted an 
evaluation of Applicant's disability and arrived at a combined evaluation of 60 per cent, which it used to calculate his monthly disability allowance (<EM>see</EM> exs.P 
and R ; R.T. , at 53-54).  Before Applicant could receive his monthly disability allowance, though, governing law required VA to hold back monthly payments 
until such time as his entire severance payment was recouped.  Recoupment was completed in January 2005, and Applicant received his first monthly disability 
payment from VA in February 2005 in the amount of $1,090.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. P).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Faced with a continuing medical disability following his military discharge in May 2000 and a marriage to his second wife (W2), and child support obligations, 
Applicant encountered difficulty finding full time career opportunities.  He worked as a claims adjuster for a local insurance company for a little over a year 
before joining a local car dealership as a new car salesman in September 2001, each time making much less than what he was accustomed to netting in the 
Army (R.T., at 37-39).  In the meantime, he and W2 over a nine-month period spent their entire $48,081.00 disability allowance on assorted merchandise (<EM>e.g., 
</EM>furniture, a $48,000.00 minivan, clothing for his wife and a down payment of $6,800.00 on some land purchased by his father-in-law), a vacation and 
reestablishing credit with some of his credit card accounts (<EM>see</EM> ex. O; R.T., at 54). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After making payments of about $7,000.00 on a minivan he and W2 had purchased earlier for about $24,000.00, Applicant and his wife stopped making 
payments on the vehicle in early 2002 due to income shortages and the press of other financial priorities  (R.T., at 97).  By March 2002, the car lender wrote off 
the debt, and prepared to recover the car as a repossession.  Knowing he was facing a major deficiency from the letter he received in September 2002 from the 
lender (R.T., at 95) advising him of what the car brought at auction (around $9,000.00), Applicant and W2, (with the help of his mother as a co-signer),  
nonetheless, bought a new SUV in October 2002 from the dealership he was employed by, at a cost of around $48,000.00 (R.T., at 72).  Applicant was notified 
in December 2002 of a deficiency on the minivan (around $12,000.00), which neither he nor his wife have paid on (R.T., at 103-04).  The SUV they purchased 
in October 2002 was also repossessed (believed to be around October 2003) after W2 lost her job and she and Applicant could no longer keep up with these 
payments either.  The vehicle was later  sold at auction for a discounted price, leaving a substantial deficiency.  Applicant and the car lender ultimately settled 
on a $7,000.00 deficiency with payments of $200.00 a month to pay off the agreed balance (R.T., at 99, 109-112).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides the deficiencies owed on his two car repossessions following his military discharge, Applicant encountered continuing child support (over $600.00 a 
month enforced through withholding ordered in July 2002) and difficulties meeting his other debts.  Although he disputes the amounts owing on some of his 
listed debts in the SOR, he acknowledges he is still indebted to creditor 1.b (for about $400.00), to creditor 1.c (for about $1,000.00), to creditor 1.d for about 
$1,300.00 (following a substantial reduction in the debt through garnishment), and to creditor 1.e (for about $400.00).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the benefit of his increased income from his current employer (around $36,000.00 annually), Applicant has been able to make visible progress in staying 
current with his child support and current living expenses (including the rent he pays to his father-in-law) on the home his father-in-law purchased in his behalf 
(<EM>see </EM>ex. O; R.T., at 43-44).  He has been able to take care of the little bills (such as, <EM>e.g., </EM>creditors 1.e and 1.f) and has begun to focus on resolving his larger 
debts (<EM>see</EM> exs. M and N; R.T., at 44).  With the $289.00 monthly garnishment taken every month from his pay check, he has been able to reduce creditor 1.d's 
debt from over $4,200.00 to a little over $1,300.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. G; R.T., at 44-46).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, Applicant continues to encounter major  expenses on medications for W2 and his step son, which their current insurance does not cover under their 
$3,000.00 deductible (<EM>see</EM> ex. L; R.T., at 49-51).  He estimates he still owes in excess of $24,000.00 to his listed creditors, inclusive of the SUV deficiency that 
was not specifically alleged in the SOR.  Broken down, he still owes creditors 1.a (in excess of $12,000.00) and 1.h on the car repossession deficiencies, as well 
as creditor 1.b (around $400.00), creditor 1.c (over $1,000.00), creditor 1.d (over $1,300.00), and creditor 1.e, which he initially disputed (nearly $400.00).  
Only his debts to creditors 1.f, 1.g and 1.h warrant crediting with payment (<EM>see</EM> exs. 2 and M).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does show his income to be improving now that he is drawing his monthly disability payments from the VA (<EM>see</EM> exs. N and P).  And he is making 
steady progress in keeping his rental payments current with his father-in-law. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a history of Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief during his military service and subsequently accrued delinquent debts 
following his discharge in 2000 for medical disability reasons.  Applicant's eight listed delinquent debts include substantial deficiencies  on two vehicle 
repossessions and debts on credit card and utility accounts and total over $15,000.00. While the second listed deficiency (creditor 1.h) has since been paid off, 
Applicant has accumulated a third major deficiency on a repossession of a purchased SUV in October 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on Applicant's considerable accumulation of delinquent debt, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for Guideline F 
apply: E2.A6.1.2 <EM>(A history of not meeting financial obligations)</EM> and E2.A6.1.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  While his accrued debts are 
accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>medical disability and reduced hours and pay, followed by a layoff, and ordered child support 
withholding), for the most part his troubles were the result of trying to live beyond his means.  Finances available to him, beginning with his large disability 
advance in 2000, have generally permitted him to make some payments on his old creditors with the resources available to him.  This he has been doing with 
several of his creditors.  Most of his debts, however, remain unaddressed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Extenuating circumstances account for some of Applicant's financial difficulties over the past 20 years (both before and subsequent to his medical discharge 
from the Army).  To this extent, Applicant's debts are extenuated enough to enable him to take advantage of one of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the 
Guidelines (for financial): E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>).  Application of this mitigating condition is based on his past and recent 
payment efforts with respect to four of the debts listed in the SOR and the more recent deficiency he has been making payments on.  Within the time permitted 
to supplement the record, Applicant is able to document payment of three of the eight listed debts (<EM>i.e., </EM>creditors 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Extenuating circumstances associated with Applicant's medical disability, loss of income and mounting medical expenses do not account for all of Applicant's 
financial difficulties.  Some of his difficulties derive from poor choices and imprudent managing of his disability severance payment and his car purchases.  
Payment of his delinquent debts continues to be a work in progress that can be expected to take several years to accomplish, based on his repayment initiatives 
to date and the exhibited resources he and W2 have available to them.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Where (as here) there is insufficient evidence of repayment efforts after the conditions that contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the 
Appeal Board has cautioned against crediting the applicant with mitigation of past financial difficulties under E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>) of the 
Guidelines or excusing him from addressing his delinquent debts (even those accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 
(September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's 1998 bankruptcy (<EM>see</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21045 (December 2004) and accumulated debts 
following his bankruptcy discharge and the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with some of his major debts in the past, it is too soon to credit 
Applicant with successful mitigation of the Government's security concerns at this time.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to 
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e and 1.I of the allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F  Applicant mitigates security 
concerns with respect to subparagraphs 1.f through 1.h.. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2: 2.1 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
