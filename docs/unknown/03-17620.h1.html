</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, a naturalized citizen of the United States, is an owner-employee of a computer services company which contracts with federal agencies.  He has two 
brothers living in South Korea.  Another brother and his mother are South Korean citizens living in the United States.  Clearance was granted.  The government 
appealed.  The Appeal Board remanded the decision.  After additional findings of facts and conclusions, I again conclude that Applicant successfully mitigated 
the security concerns under Guidelines B and E.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR detailed foreign influence and personal 
conduct issues as the reasons why DOHA could not find that it is clearly in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated August 9, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was  assigned to me 
on February 24, 2005.  Notice of the hearing was dated April 1,  2005.  A hearing was conducted on May 3, 2005.  The transcript was received May 13, 2005.  
A decision was entered on June 22, 2005.  The government appealed.  The Appeal Board remanded the case on April 17, 2006.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">APPELLATE ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Appeal Board directed me to issue findings of fact and discuss SOR &para; 2.b., and to discuss  adjudicative process guidelines E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I adopt the findings of fact from the original decision and make the following additional findings of fact.  SOR &para; 2.b. alleges that during an April 23, 2004 
interview with an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense, Applicant stated that his brother's sole duties involved bookkeeping, notwithstanding 
the fact that the Japanese and Korean components of Applicant's company's website listed his brother as a point of contact.  As of February 2004, his brother 
ceased to be employed by his company, as an accountant and an employee.  </P> 
<P>The solutions engineer/sales manager of Applicant's company testified that since joining the company in 1999, there were no business relationships with any 
foreign business.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The contact person's name for foreign business on the company's website and some foreign language instructions had been removed from 
that website.  The company was trying its best to develop business from as many sources as possible.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) suggested the 
company use any methods possible to obtain business, with the goal of partnering with larger defense corporations.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's brother was responsible for accounting and inventory control.  He was listed as the foreign business contact person on the company's website 
because he spoke the Japanese and Korean languages.  He would only be used as an interpreter because he did not have the ability to market or sign contracts.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
He no longer works for the company.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Two brothers live in South Korea.  One is an administrator with a private university and the other operates a small store.  Neither has involvement with 
political, scientific, or commercial activities with the South Korean government.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has not been approached by foreign agents, and said if he would be he would contact his contracting officer or a government security officer.  If 
forced to make a choice, he would choose loyalty to the U. S. over loyalty to his brothers.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant renounced his South Korean citizenship when he became 
a U. S. citizen.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  His daughter said that when there were family discussions, only things about the U. S. were discussed.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She stated that if he were ever 
approached by a foreign government, he would immediately contact his point of contact within the U. S. Government.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>When Applicant came to the U. S., he found employment with large corporations and has never felt the need to have contacts with Koreans.  Many ethnic 
groups form a relationship within their ethnic community because they cannot survive without it.  He never felt that need.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Regarding the potential for coercion or duress, consider this testimony:</P> 
<P>Q.  Let me ask you sir, to your knowledge, have you ever been approached or targeted by any terrorists here in the United States?</P> 
<P>A.  Not at all.</P> 
<P>Q.  And to your knowledge, have you ever been approached or targeted by any agents of a foreign power?</P> 
<P>A.  Not at all</P> 
<P>Q.  Now, were you to be approached by terrorists, or an agent of a foreign power, whether South Korean or another country, what would you do?</P> 
<P>A.  Well, first of all, I'd call my contracting officer, or Pentagon security officer, and consult with them, and follow their instruction.  Rather than trying myself.  
I don't think it's the proper way.  And I believe some - - I have a very limited power, but the government has a lot of resources, and they have power, so relying 
on the government, that's the best way.  That's what I believe.</P> 
<P>Q.  Now given the fact though that you do have siblings in the Republic of South Korea, do you believe that subjects you to coercion, exploitation, or any type 
of pressure that the South Korean government can impose on you?</P> 
<P>A.  Not that I know of, and not that I can think of.  And if it happens, I'll have to choose the U. S. Government.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's company has contracts with federal agencies to repair computer parts, printers, and to install network cabling.  His company installed the network 
cabling throughout DOHA's offices at One Liberty Center.<A HREF="03-17620.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I adopt the statement of policies in the original decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>SOR &para; 2.b.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The following apply: Guideline E, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2.<EM>  (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM>, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC 
DC E2.A5.1.2.3.  <EM>(Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, 
competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination).  </EM>The government 
alleged Applicant made false statements to an investigator during the course of his security clearance by stating that his brother's only job was as a bookkeeper.  
It is alleged that Applicant stated in an interview that he did not have any foreign business interests, while his company's website listed his business as actively 
engaged in foreign business and listed his brother as a point of contact.  Applicant's answer was credible.  He had no such interests at the time of the interview.  
This was a true statement.  The website was used as an advertising tool to attract attention from larger companies with which the company  might do business.  
The company had done foreign business prior to 1992.  Applicant's brother was listed as the point of contact as he spoke fluent Japanese and Korean.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He was engaged in "puffing" his business.  When the investigator asked him if he was doing business in a foreign setting he truthfully answered "no."  He was 
not doing business in a foreign country.  He was not asked, "Could you do business in a foreign country?"  This was corroborated by his sales manager's 
testimony that since at least 1999, there had been no request by anyone either from a foreign business or by a U. S. company wanting to do business in a foreign 
company.  He further testified that Applicant's brother was an accountant and watched the inventory and that he had no authority to market the company nor to 
sign any contracts for the company.  He would have been an interpreter if some firm had wanted Applicant's company do business where knowledge of the 
Korean or Japanese language was required.  That request never came, and this information was removed from Applicant's website after the brother left 
Applicant's company.  Applicant may have misunderstood the agent's question and the agent misinterpreted Applicant's answer.  I do not find any false 
statement by Applicant either on his SF 86 or in the interview, nor do I find that there was any intent by Applicant to give a false answer.   Applicant testified 
truthfully to the agent because his knowledge and understanding of the facts were different from that of the agent.  I find for the Applicant on SOR &para; 2.b<STRONG>. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Adjudicative Process<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E2.2.1. The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is 
eligible for as security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. 
The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the 
adjudicator should consider the following factors:<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</STRONG>;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.2.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The extent of Applicant's foreign influence is that he has two brothers living in Korea.  Applicant's participation is involuntary.  He cannot determine who his 
brothers are or where they choose to live.  He has been in this country since 1981 and a citizen since 1988.  Neither brother works for the Korean government.  
They call Applicant maybe twice per year.  They initiate the calls because he is the oldest brother, and under Korean customs, since their father is deceased, he 
is looked upon as the family's "father figure."  The customary respect afforded  the eldest male is that the younger siblings call him.  His witnesses testified that 
he never talked about Korea, that he only talked about America, and he never socialized with Korean people.   In effect, he is thoroughly "Americanized."  I feel 
these facts do not raise any serious security concerns about him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence that Applicant has any foreign affinity or preference for Korea.  A close reading of his testimony and that of his witnesses reveal a person 
totally committed to following the American dream of building his business, caring for his wife and children, and contributing to the common good of society.  
He does not associate with persons from Korea.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 56 years old.  He has been a citizen for eighteen years.  He demonstrated to me that he was mature and took his responsibilities seriously, including 
those required of a person with a security clearance.  He is described as honest, hard-working, and committed to the United States.  He hasn't committed any 
illegal or unethical conduct.  And I find that his testimony was credible, because he answered questions directly, completely, and honestly.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applying the whole person concept and a common sense reading of the evidence in this case leads me to conclude allegations 1.a. through 1.c. and 2.a. and b. of 
the SOR in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by &para; E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline B:  FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.   For Applicant</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On remand, in light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I find again it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant's security clearance.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P>
