<P>Applicant's pattern of financial irresponsibility renders him an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 1 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of financial considerations.<A HREF="03-00920.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He answered the SOR on 20 October 2003 and requested a decision without a hearing. He did not respond 
to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 12 May 2004. The record in this case closed 19 June 2004, the day the response was due. The 
case was assigned to me 9 July 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for the debt at 1.f., which he neither admitted nor denied, and the allegations at 1.i. and 1.j., which he denied as 
accounts he did not recognize. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He previously had a clearance in 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties and irresponsibility dating back to 1997. He has 10 delinquent credit accounts totaling over $5,000.00, that fell 
past due between May 1997 and  and May 2003. None of these debts were caused by circumstances beyond his control. In a January 2002 interview, he 
admitted falling into debt because of his irresponsible use of credit, but also stated that he intended to resolve the debts, and was expecting to pay off one of the 
accounts (1.h.) by March 2002. Yet, those accounts remained unpaid according to a July 2003 credit bureau report. Applicant's July 2003 response to 
interrogatories stated his intent to pay the debts at 1a. and 1.g. by October 2003, but those debts remained unpaid according to a May 2004 credit bureau 
report--which also showed additional accounts falling delinquent since the SOR was issued. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has previously stated his intention to resolve his debts and to seek credit counseling, yet he has not documented any credit counseling, just as he has 
not documented any of his claimed payments or his claimed contacts with creditors.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and 
circumstances presented. Each adjudicative decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDENS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security 
clearance. The government must prove--by something less than a preponderance of the evidence--controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it 
establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one 
has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect 
national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-00920.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F and Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. The record demonstrates Applicant's 
substantial indebtedness, acquired through his own irresponsibility, and largely ignored since before his January 2002 subject interview. Indeed, five of the 
delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR fell delinquent after the interview. His most recent credit report suggests his financial situation has not improved, but 
has instead deteriorated. He has made no arrangements to satisfy any of the outstanding debts. His response to his delinquent accounts bespeaks a financial 
irresponsibility inconsistent with access to classified information <A HREF="03-00920.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. 
They are not due to circumstances beyond his control. He has not stopped digging himself into a financial hole, much less started to pull himself out of it. I 
conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
