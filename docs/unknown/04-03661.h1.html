<P>Applicant accrued nearly $12,000 in delinquent or past due debts between 1998 and 2002. His delinquencies in large part were the result of unforeseen events 
or other conditions beyond his control. He has paid or otherwise resolved all of his debts, and his finances are currently sound. Applicant's omissions from a 
security clearance questionnaire of his facts about his debts and about his arrest record were unintentional. Accordingly, Applicant has mitigated the related 
security concerns about his finances and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On May 11, 2005, DOHA issued an 
SOR to Applicant regarding facts in his background that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations) and 
Guideline E (personal conduct). Specifically, the SOR presented allegations Applicant had accrued more than $16,000 in delinquent debts in the form of eight 
personal credit accounts (SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.h). The SOR also contained allegations Applicant deliberately withheld from a March 2003 security clearance 
application (SF 86) facts about his arrest record (SOR &para; 2.a) and about his delinquent debts (SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c). Applicant timely answered the SOR 
(Answer), and denied two of the allegations about his debts (SOR &para;&para; 1.e and 1.g) and all of the allegations of deliberate falsification (SOR &para;&para; 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c).</P> 
<P>Applicant also requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 10, 2005, and I convened a hearing on September 21, 2005. The parties appeared as 
scheduled and the government presented six exhibits (GE 1 through 6), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and 
submitted eight exhibits admitted into the record as AE A - H. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 6, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 48 years old and employed by a defense contractor as an air conditioning and refrigeration technician. He served for 22 years in the United States 
arine Corps, retiring in 1997 as a company first sergeant in the Corps' Recon Division. After retiring, he was self-employed until illness and divorce forced 
him to find other work. After separating in 1998, Applicant and his wife finalized their divorce in June 2001. They have two sons, one of whom is still a minor 
and now lives with Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also in 1998, Applicant developed diverticulitis, an intestinal disorder that required two surgeries and kept Applicant in the hospital over a month. After he 
went home, it took him about six months to recover to the point he could work steadily. In the meantime, personal credit accounts left over after his marriage, 
as well as legal fees incurred to get custody of his son went unpaid. Applicant was unaware of many of the debts insofar as he thought most were his ex-wife's 
responsibility and he assumed she would pay them. Others he was simply unable to pay given his  inability to work full time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts consisted of about $9,000 in unpaid credit cards (SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.e). One of the credit cards was enforced through a civil judgment in favor of 
a national hardware chain (SOR &para; 1.h). Applicant also incurred a delinquent utility bill when he and his wife moved from the last residence they had while he 
was in the military (SOR &para; 1.f). Finally, Applicant failed to timely pay a $30 bill for medical services in 2002 (SOR &para; 1.g). With the exception of this last 
medical bill, all of Applicant's delinquencies arose between 1998 and 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been arrested and/or charged four times with alcohol-related offenses. In April 1979, he was charged with being drunk in public. There is no 
information available regarding the circumstances or disposition of that charge. In March 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired 
(DWI). He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving and was assessed a fine and court costs. In July 2000, Applicant got into an argument with another customer 
at a local convenience store. The police were called and, because he had had a few beers that day, he was detained for four hours, then released after being cited 
for drunk in public, to which he later pleaded guilty. He was assessed a fine and court costs. In January 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving 
under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He later pleaded guilty, was fined, and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness and safety class. Applicant has not 
consumed any alcohol since sometime in 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 20, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) to initiate a review of his suitability for access to classified information. In 
response to question 24, which asked whether Applicant had ever been arrested for or charged with alcohol- or drug-related offenses, Applicant answered "yes," 
and listed his 1999 DUI arrest. He omitted the 1979 drunk in public charge because he had forgotten about it; he omitted the 1994 DWI charge because he had 
pled guilty to reckless driving. As such, he thought he did not have to list the original charge. He also thought he did not have to list it because it had been more 
than seven years earlier. Applicant also did not list his July 2000 drunk in public charge because he had forgotten about this incident as well.  Applicant fully 
disclosed the omitted information to a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in a subject interview in December 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to questions 37, 38, and 39, which ask for information about unpaid judgments, debts greater than 180 days delinquent, and debts more than 90 days 
past due, respectively, Applicant answered "no." He testified he was unaware of the judgment or the delinquent debts at the time he filled out the SF 86. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At time he was interviewed by DSS, Applicant was making about $2,500 monthly after deductions. This included his $600<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in monthly retired military pay. His 
current position pays him $16 hourly, which equates to around $2,500 monthly before deductions and does not include his retired pay; however, Applicant 
averages at least 50 hours each week, so that his gross monthly pay from his contractor job alone is about $3,200. In the past year, Applicant has paid the debts 
listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. The debt listed in SOR &para; 1.b is the same as the now-satisfied judgment in SOR &para; 1.h. Applicant reached an agreement 
with the creditor listed in SOR &para; 1.c, whereby he pays them $200 each month taken automatically from his checking account. Applicant asserts that after 
researching the debt for about $4,600 listed in SOR &para; 1.e, he has been unable to determine this is a valid debt attributable to him.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant now has custody of his 16-year-old son and no longer has to pay child support to his ex-wife. He now cares for his elderly mother and had to defer 
paying the aforementioned debts  long enough to make long-needed repairs to her house. He is also awaiting approval of his request to become the legal 
guardian of his disabled, adult sister.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To that end, the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and  Guideline F (financial considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern stated under Guideline E is that conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government has 
alleged Applicant deliberately falsified four answers in his SF 86. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The available information establishes the underlying facts and that they were not disclosed in 
Applicant's SF 86. Accordingly, the government is reasonably concerned, in light of the results of Applicant's background investigation, about whether he can 
be relied on to tell the truth even in adverse circumstances. An applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting a security 
clearance. Because false or incomplete information given in the questionnaire is capable of affecting the way in which Department of Defense personnel 
perform their official functions in making an informed assessment of a person's suitability to hold a clearance, it is material. Moreover, a false answer is 
material even if there is no proof that it actually influenced an agency's investigatory functions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, to be disqualifying such omissions must have been made deliberately.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Simple mistakes through forgetfulness or confusion about the question do not 
indicate a defect in a person's reliability or integrity. I conclude, based on the totality of available information in this regard, that Applicant did not intend to 
falsify his answers to the SF 86. At the outset, it is important to note that I found Applicant's testimony at hearing to be forthright and credible. Further, it 
appears he made a full disclosure of the omitted debts and criminal charges when he was interviewed by DSS during his investigation. As to his omission from 
his SF 86 of three of his alcohol-related arrests, his explanations are plausible. Many times arrests for public intoxication are disposed of in much the same 
fashion as traffic tickets. As to the 1979 charge, Applicant's claim he forgot about it is reasonable. As to his 1994 DWI charge, it is also reasonable he 
misinterpreted his obligation to disclose this because he pleaded to a lesser offense. Lastly, if Applicant wished to withhold this information from the 
government, it does not follow that he would list the 1999 arrest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his negative answers to questions 37, 38, and 39, I accept as credible Applicant's claim he was unaware of the debts and the judgment. Such 
circumstances are not unusual when an individual has been divorced, relocated, and hospitalized as was Applicant. On balance, in the absence of intent to 
falsify his SF 86, I conclude none of the Guideline E disqualifying conditions (DC) apply, and this guideline is resolved in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The facts presented through the government's information offered in support of the SOR allegations also raise security concerns addressed in the Directive 
under Guideline F. Specifically, an applicant who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of 
engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties. Failure to reasonably attend to personal finances may also indicate poor judgment 
and reliability in other facets of one's conduct.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> These facts also support application of  Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3.<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 1 applies 
based on the fact there is a record of delinquencies attributable to the Applicant. As to DC 3, even after Applicant became aware of the extent of his 
indebtedness through his DSS interview, he was unable to pay until he made repairs on his mother's house. He was also faced with ongoing legal expenses 
while pursuing full custody of his younger son.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the government is reasonably concerned about the risks attendant to Applicant's indebtedness, Applicant has taken sufficient action to ease those 
concerns. In short, he has paid or is paying the listed debts attributable to him. Except for one $30 delinquency in 2002, he has incurred no other financial 
problems since 2000. The circumstances that led to his financial difficulties - divorce, medical problems, unreliable employment prospects - no longer exist. 
Based on all of the available information about Applicant's finances, Guideline F mitigating condition (MC) 1,<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> MC 3,<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 6<A HREF="04-03661.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here, and I resolve 
this guideline in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Applicant's omissions from his SF 86 were unintentional 
and, therefore, not disqualifying. Additionally, he amassed a  significant amount of personal debt due almost entirely to circumstances beyond his control, but 
has taken sufficient corrective action to alleviate the security concerns about his past financial difficulties. Any reasonable doubts arising from the results of 
Applicant's background investigation have been satisfactorily addressed and he has overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
