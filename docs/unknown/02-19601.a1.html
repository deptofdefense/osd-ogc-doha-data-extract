  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  There is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of showing harmful error.  Applicant's disagreement with the Administrative Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a  manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to  show the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.   </P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 11, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated December 30, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  In his appeal brief Applicant offers commentary on various parts of 
the evidentiary record.  The commentary essentially minimizes the potential threat to national security posed by the part-time residence of his parents and his in-laws in the Republic of the Philippines and by an earlier statement by Applicant that he might be subject to coercion if his parents and in-laws were threatened.  
Applicant requests that the decision to deny him a security clearance be reversed.  The Board construes Applicant's brief as raising the issue of whether the 
Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains assertions that do not appear in the record below.  As such, these assertions constitute new evidence which cannot be 
considered on appeal.  See Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant raises no specific claim of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  As indicated in preceding paragraphs, Applicant's brief consists 
of a reiteration of some of the record evidence, commentary upon that evidence, and assertions that constitute new evidence.  There is no presumption of error 
below and an appealing party bears the burden of establishing harmful error on appeal.  The ability of Applicant to argue for an interpretation of the record 
evidence that differs from the interpretation adopted by the Administrative Judge fails to demonstrate that the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-04826 (July 15, 2002) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge is responsible for weighing the record evidence in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's 
assessment of the evidence is not sufficient to persuade the Board that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-10301 (December 30, 2002)  at pp. 3-4.  Accordingly, the Administrative Judge's conclusions are sustainable.</P>
