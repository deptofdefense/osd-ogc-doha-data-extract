<P>	On July 22, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, signed August 12, 1997, the Applicant responded
to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing. </P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on August 25, 1997, and
held a hearing on October 1, 1997.  The Department Counsel presented seven exhibits ("Exhs") and
the testimony of no witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of the presentation of five exhibits
and the testimony of three witnesses besides his own.  A sixth exhibit was submitted by the
Applicant on October 6, 1997, and admitted into evidence without objection.  The undersigned
Administrative Judge received the transcript ("Tr") of the hearing on October 8, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two
criteria: paragraph 1, Criterion E (personal conduct) and paragraph 2, Criterion J (criminal conduct). 
 SOR &para; 1.a. and &para; 1.b. allege that the Applicant concealed information concerning some arrests on
his April 1996 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86), and SOR &para; 1.c. and &para; 1.d.
allege that he concealed in writing the same information from a Defense Investigative Service (DIS)
agent on two subsequent occasions.  SOR &para; 2.a. alleges that such concealment constitutes a violation
of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, and SOR &para; 2.b. alleges that his arrest in January 1987 for possession of stolen
property (as to which he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct) is part of a history or
pattern of criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a U.S. Government contractor.  He seeks to
obtain a Secret personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Applicant attended a vocation/technical school during 1989-93 and in November 1995
was hired by his present employer.  He signed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) in April 1996 on which he listed two instances in response to the question concerning his police
record, <EM>viz</EM>., a handgun violation, for which he was placed on probation, and a conviction for grand
larceny, for which he was sentenced to 2-5 years incarceration and served two years "in jail." 
Neither offense is identified in SOR &para; 2 as part of an alleged "history or pattern of criminal activity." 
The Applicant was paroled from jail sometime in the first part of 1986 for about three years and
placed on work release.  However, the Applicant did not list three other instances in response to the
police record question on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) as discussed
below.</P>

<P>1. In July 1986 the Applicant had an argument with his girl friend.  She called the police who
arrested the Applicant for possession of a weapon, assault, and menacing.  It turned out that the
weapon belonged to the Applicant's roommate and was in the roommate's possession.  The
Applicant denied all the charges, and they were dismissed in court.  Tr pages 115-116, 147-149, 153-156.</P>

<P>2. In January 1987 the Applicant purchased a used car from a private owner.  The seller gave the
Applicant out-of-state license plates to use until the Applicant had registered the car in his own
name.  On the way to his girl friend's house, having just bought the car, the Applicant was stopped
by the police who told him that the license plates (not the car itself) had been previously stolen. 
Although the Applicant did not know they had been stolen, he was arrested for possession of stolen
property.  The Applicant was taken to the police station, ticketed, fined $50--apparently on a
disorderly conduct charge--and released.  He did not pay the fine and, unbeknownst to him, an arrest
warrant was issued in June 1987.  Tr pages 58-59, 131-132, 139-140.  In November 1987 the
Applicant moved out-of-state.  On December 4, 1996, the Applicant paid the $50 fine after learning
about the warrant.</P>

<P>3. In September 1988 the Applicant was arrested on numerous charges along with his brother and
his uncle arising out of a routine traffic stop on a turnpike by state police.  The charges included
possession of a weapon and a controlled dangerous substance.  The Applicant believes that he was
"set up" on false charges.  All charges were dismissed in court.</P>

<P>	The Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent in August
1996 concerning his arrest record.  His signed sworn statement on that occasion disclosed the details
of the convictions he had reported on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86).  The
statement declared that he had "satisfactorily completed [his] sentencing and have had no further
involvement with the law enforcement."  The Applicant was again interviewed in October 1996 by
the same agent, who asked him whether he had been arrested and charged on specific dates in July
1986, January 1987, or September 1988.  The sworn statement signed by the Applicant on that
occasion denies being "arrested and charged" on any of those dates and declares:</P>

<P>"I got out of jail around Dec [<EM>sic</EM>] 86.  Therefor[e] I couldn't have committed any crimes from 86
to 90 or [I] would have gone straight back to jail.  This never occurred because these charges are not
mine. . . .  I have never violated my parole through criminal involvement."</P>

<P>The Applicant was subsequently interviewed by a second Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent. 
<EM>See</EM> the Applicant's answer to the SOR, August 12, 1997, page 4.  He admitted the arrest charges
then but told the agent that "they all had been dismissed."  Tr pages 126-129, 134-135.</P>

<P>The Applicant was interviewed by a third Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent in April 1997. 
In a sworn statement signed by the Applicant on that occasion, the Applicant discussed the above-mentioned three arrests and declared:</P>

<P>"I have not been involved with illegal drugs or weapons since getting out of prison around 1986. 
I am sorry I was so evasive about these arrests, but I was afraid to admit the truth for fear no one
would believe me."  <EM>See also</EM> tr pages 110-111.</P>

<P>	The Applicant has presented testimony and several letters of recommendation from friends,
as well as from supervisors and other associates at work.  They attest to his "positive change in his
entire life," his professionalism, his work ethic, and to his honesty.  The Applicant has not violated
any security regulations during his current employment or divulged any private company
information to unauthorized persons.  He has a general reputation for being trustworthy.  Tr page
102.  In addition to their 9-year-old daughter, he and his wife have been raising his deceased sister's
7-year-old son since 1995 and his 15-year-old son from a prior relationship since about 1993.  Tr
pages 104, 125, 145, 150-153.  He keeps secrets confided in him by friends.  Tr page 146.</P>

</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION E - PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,
unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly
safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></P>

<P>  			(2)	the deliberate omission, concealment,
or falsification of relevant and
material facts from any personnel
security questionnaire, personal
history statement, or similar form used
to conduct investigations, determine
employment qualifications, award
benefits or status, determine security
clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary
responsibilities; </P>

<P>			  (3)	deliberately providing false or
misleading information concerning
relevant and material matters to an
investigator, security official,
competent medical authority, or other
official representative in connection
with a personnel security or
trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			None applicable.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION J - CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally
charged; </P>

<P>			  (2)	a single serious crime or multiple
lesser offenses.</P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (1)	the criminal behavior was not recent; </P>

<P>			  (2)	the crime was an isolated incident;</P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0466.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0466.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of those who testified<A NAME="witnesses or non-hearing?"></A> the undersigned
concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criteria E and J.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant has offered a couple of explanations why he did not list his arrests on the
dismissed charges in the 1986-88 period on his Questionnaire (SF-86) in April 1996, and why he did
not volunteer that information to a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent in August and October
1996.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	First, there is the explanation that he forgot about them.  This is facially reasonable since they
occurred some ten years ago.  The facility security officer (FSO) that took his completed SF-86 form
did not press him to use the continuation space on the form to add other arrests as does the current
FSO.  Tr pages 91-93.  The DIS agent simply asked him what happened on three specific dates
during that time period.  Tr pages 132, 189.  This question probably would not refresh his memory
of forgotten incidents.  Furthermore, there is the argument that the Applicant had no motivation to
conceal dismissed charges from the Government while admitting convictions, one of which--as he
had he listed--had resulted in two years' incarceration; in consequence, he must have forgotten
about the other arrests. Yet, the FSO had no obligation to press the Applicant, nor was the DIS agent
obliged to confront him with details of the arrest charges on the specific dates in question. 
oreover, he stated in writing in April 1997: "I am sorry I was so evasive about these arrests, but
I was afraid to admit the truth for fear no one would believe me."  This Administrative Judge
concludes that, while poor recall and repression of the memory of adverse incidents clearly played
a part in the actions of the Applicant, the credible April 1997 DIS statement undercuts that
explanation seriously.  The Applicant did not attempt to disavow that statement at the hearing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Second, there is the explanation that he did not understand the difference between an arrest
on charges later dismissed and an arrest on charges on which there was a conviction.  The Applicant
at the hearing seemed at times to confuse these two concepts.  <EM>See</EM>, for example, tr page 133.  His
October 1996 DIS statement also suggests that he believed that any "arrest" is the same as the
commission of a crime that would have constituted a parole violation.  Substantial support for this
explanation was provided by the Applicant's wife who testified credibly that as late as August 1997
she confronted the Applicant with the distinction between an arrest and a conviction.  Tr pages 158-166, 170-172.  Yet, the Applicant had been arrested in his late teens on a handgun violation and had
served a two year sentence for grand larceny when he was 25 years of age,  some eleven years ago.
This Administrative Judge does not believe that he did not in 1996--and does not now--know the
difference between the term "arrest" and the term "conviction."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The most convincing explanation is that the Applicant answered a question that he himself
had contrived, namely, "Have you ever committed a felony or an offense involving firearms,
explosives, alcohol, or illegal drugs?"  Although question 23 on the SF-86 Questionnaire is entitled
"Your Police Record" and uses the terms "charged with" and "arrested for," the Applicant chose to
read the question as limited to convictions as testified by the FSO at the hearing.  Tr page 88.  Both
DIS statements commence with the words "regarding arrests."  Exh 3 and exh. 4.  The Applicant
may have at his own peril decided that the Government was uninterested in knowing about arrests
on charges that were later dismissed for one reason or another. The Applicant cannot wholly blame
his poor memory or his confusion and misunderstanding of terms for making up his own question
and for insisting on limiting his answers to that question.  The concealment occurred recently and
repeatedly and is not satisfactorily mitigated by inadequate advice.  Therefore, SOR &para; 1, relating to
concealment, is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	With regard to Criterion J, subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR charges that Applicant's
concealment constitutes criminal conduct (18 U.S.C. &sect;1001).<A HREF="97-0466.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Conduct violative of that Act of
Congress is a Federal felony.  DC #1 and DC #2, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, are applicable.  The
undersigned concludes that the Applicant knowingly and willfully concealed his arrests on charges
that were later dismissed and therefore concludes SOR &para; 2.a. adversely to the Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	SOR &para; 2.b. charges that the Applicant's </FONT>arrest in January 1987 for possession of stolen
property (to which he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct) constitutes part of a history
or pattern of criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
The circumstances of this arrest were unique--the most innocent person could equally have been
placed unwittingly in such circumstances--and the charge of possession of stolen property was
sensibly dropped ten years ago.  Ignorance of a warrant for nonpayment of a $50 fine by one who
shortly after its issuance moved out-of-state is understandable.  Failure to pay a $50 traffic ticket is
hardly security significant ten years later.  MC #1 and MC #2, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, are
applicable.  Therefore, SOR &para; 2.b., relating to criminal conduct, is concluded favorably to the
Applicant.</P>

<P>	Each case decision is required to consider, as appropriate, the factors listed in Section F.3 and
enclosure 2 to the Directive, identified on pages 5-6 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The seriousness, frequency, and recency
of the Applicant's deliberate concealment militate against the Applicant.  His chronological age is
much too advanced to serve as convincing extenuation for the sort of evasion to which he admitted. 
In his favor are the facts that he has clearly improved his lifestyle and has proven himself responsible
to his family and conscientious to his employer.  The Government cannot take the risk that this
Applicant will again conceal material information from the Government when fairly and openly
requested.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3
of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional procedural guidance contained in item
25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
