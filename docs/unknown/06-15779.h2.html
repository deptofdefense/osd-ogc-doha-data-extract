<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Forty-six-year-old Applicant is a Russian-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, who has lived in the United States since 1991.  He has substantially more connections to the United States than to Russia.  
His mother is a citizen of Moldova, his aunt is a citizen of Ukraine, and his 17-year-old daughter is a citizen of Russia.  He has no direct contact with his aunt, and his mother and daughter live in

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 7, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On July 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The 
SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on August 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and asked for a hearing.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The case was assigned to me on October 5, 2006.  The hearing was held on 
October 27, 2006.  DOHA received the hearing record on November 13, 2006.       </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel asked for administrative notice of Items 3 to 12, as listed on his exhibit list (R. 14-15).  Items 3 to 9 and 12 are Department of State publications pertaining to 
oldova and the Russian Federation.  Item 10 is a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on Russia, and Item 11 is a Department of Justice press release on Hanssen's guilty plea to 
espionage. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service</EM>, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR 
proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. <EM>See</EM> Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for 
administrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Items 3 to 12, and I approved administrative notice of Items 3-12.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant agreed to many of the underlying facts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, and 2.a to 2.d.  However, he explained why he retained a Russian passport, and that his connections to his Russian and 
oldovan relatives are not as extensive as listed in the SOR.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  For SOR &para; 1.a, he delayed returning his Russian passport to Russian authorities because he was unsure how to document its delivery 
to Russian authorities.  For SOR &para; 2.c, he did not have a Secret Clearance in the Soviet Union, as alleged; and for SOR &para; 2.d he was willing to be debriefed about his military service in the Soviet 
Union. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 46 years old (R. 36).<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He was born in Russia, and he and his parents moved to Moldova in 1961 (R. 37).  He did research in atomic energy from 1984 to 1991 and received his PhD at 
a Russian University in 1991 (R. 37-38).  Prior to working with atomic energy he filled out a questionnaire, and he had a background check (R. 39-40).  He also wore a special badge.  <EM>Id</EM>.  He did 
not have a Soviet security clearance, but he did have a special clearance to work with atomic energy. <EM> Id</EM>.  His research with atomic energy was not classified or secret, and the results were published 
in open literature (R. 42; 43-44; 59). </P> 
 
<P>For his military service, Applicant went to a training camp for one month (R. 42).  He received training on nuclear ballistic missile systems.  <EM>Id</EM>.  He learned how to load and unload missiles from a 
silo, and about their engines.  <EM>Id</EM>.  His supervisors told him not to disclose information about the missiles, but he later found the information in open literature in the United States (R. 42-43).  </P> 
 
<P>In 1991, he left the Soviet Union and moved to the United States on a visa for his technical skills (R. 37, 66).  He was unhappy as a Soviet citizen because he objected to Communist methods (R. 
28, 45).  He preferred the United States' political, cultural and economic systems (R. 45).  He obtained a post-doctorate position at an American state university in 1991 (R. 38).  In 1999, he became 
a permanent resident of the United States (R. 44-45).  In March 2000, he married a 41 year old native born, U.S. citizen (R. 18, 29).<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has two children, one with Applicant (R. 19).  His child 
with his wife is six years old (R. 19).  In July 2004, he became a U.S. citizen (R. 44-45).   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's daughter (C), who was born in Russia and is a Russian citizen, came to the United States eighteen months after Applicant when she was two years old (R. 34, 49, 51-52).  Applicant and 
C went to Paris in 2000 (R. 50).  C will be 18 in January 2007 (R. 20, 48).  C is attending high school in the United States and lives with her mother (M) about 2,000 miles from Applicant (R. 48), 
but C visits Applicant and his family occasionally on holidays and during some summers (R.19-20; 49).  He provides some financial support to M for C (R. 52). Applicant wanted C to move in with 
his family and become a citizen of the United States, but was unable to cause this to occur because of his divorce from M (R. 35).  He has contact with C, about 2-3 times a month by telephone (R. 
20).  He separated from M in 1996 or 1997, and has very limited contact with M (R. 50-51).  For example, he does not know how M is employed (R. 50-51). C's maternal grandmother still lives in 
Russia, but C has no contact with her and does not know her (R. 21, 52).  M has applied for U.S citizenship, but it has not been approved (R. 20).  </P> 
 
<P>As to SOR &para; 1.a, in 2005, Applicant traveled abroad to the United Kingdom and to France for a wedding (R. 22).  That same year he used his Russian passport to go to Moscow for two days 
because his father was dying (R. 23).  His wife accompanied him on the trip (R. 46-47).  This is the only occasion he returned to Russia after leaving in 1991 (R. 48).  He did not go to Ukraine or 
visit his aunt (R. 27).  He tried to return his Russian passport, but Russian authorities told him that he should just wait until it expired (R. 34).  On October 10, 2006, he put his passport into an 
envelope, sealed it and surrendered it to the Russian embassy, "together with any claim for citizenship" (R. 34, Item B).<SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #ff0000"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In February 2005, his father and mother moved to the United States, and then his father died (R. 24).  She received social security-type payments from the Russian government until she emigrated to 
the United States (R. 54-55).  His mother now lives with Applicant and his wife, and he provides financial support to her (R. 24-25).  She was never a citizen of Russia, but his mother was a citizen 
of Moldova (R. 24).  His mother has applied to be a U.S. citizen, but she does not currently have a green card (R. 25; Items C and D).  She has not and does not intend to return to Moldova or 
Russia.  Her only relative is a sister living in Ukraine, who is dying (R. 26).  Applicant has no relatives in Moldova, Russia or Ukraine, except for his aunt living in Ukraine (R. 26).  His only 
contact with his aunt is through his mother (R. 26-27).  No other relatives except for his mother and father have visited Applicant while he has been living in the United States (R. 26).    </P> 
 
<P>In regard to SOR &para; 1.d, Applicant said that he had no reservations about providing information about his Soviet military service to the United States (R. 59).  He previously declined to provide 
information to an interviewer because the investigator said it was to satisfy his curiosity, and he did not perceive that the interviewer had an official need for the information (R. 35-36, 59). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns a home in the United States (R. 29, 60).  He has a retirement fund in the United States (R. 29).  He does not own any property, stock or bank accounts in any foreign country (R. 60).  
He has voted in U.S. elections (R. 61).  He is involved in two university-related committees (R. 61).  He is also involved with his two children's activities, especially soccer, tennis, music and 
dancing (R. 62).  Applicant said that he was bound by his oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution, the laws of the United States, and was ready to bear arms and perform service on behalf 
of the United States (R. 63).  If Russia was in a dire emergency and needed his military service, he would not go to Russia's aid (R. 63).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother is 72 years old (R. 63).  She does not work outside his home (R. 64).  She speaks very little English (R. 64).  When his mother sold her residence in Russia for $80,000 or 
$90,000, she put the money she received into a U.S. bank account (R. 61).  She has a nominal amount of stock in a Moldova company, valued at about $120.00 (R. 68). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is currently a teacher and researcher employed by a large state university, but he is not a tenured professor (R. 30, 65).  His university position is linked to a defense contractor (R. 65).  He 
wants a security clearance because he wants to increase his contributions to the U.S. defense in the area of directed-energy research, particularly involving laser and microwave weapons (R. 64-66). 
Approval of a clearance would not result in a pay raise, but he would receive a qualitative change in his work (R. 65).</P>

<P>The U.S. State Department succinctly describes the relationship between the United States and the Russian Federation as follows:</P> 
 
<P>The United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including the drastic reduction of our strategic arsenals. We are also allies in the global war on terrorism.  Russia 
shares our basic goal of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. We are working with Russia to compel Iran to bring its nuclear programs into 
compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) rules.  On North Korea, Russia is a participant in the Six-Party Talks aimed at the complete, verifiable, and irrversible dismantling of 
North Korea's nuclear program.  Russia also takes part in the Middle East Peace Process "Quartet" (along with the UN and the EU).  Russia now interacts with NATO members as an equal through 
the NATO-Russia Council but without veto power over NATO decisions.  During the past several years, Russia has intensified the efforts to combat trafficking in persons.</P>

<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth and 
discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).</SPAN><A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P>

decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States."</SPAN>  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three of nine foreign preference disqualifying conditions (FP DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FP DC 1 applies where there has been an 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"</SPAN>exercise of dual citizenship."  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.1.  FP DC 2 applies where there an applicant "possess[es] and/or use[s] a foreign passport."<EM> </EM> Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.2.  FP DC 3 applies where 
an applicant has provided "[m]ilitary service or [shown] a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country." Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.3. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1-3 apply because Applicant used his Russian passport in 2005, and he served in the Soviet military prior to coming to the United States in 1991.  FP DC 2 also applies because he retained 
or used his Russian passport until October 2006.   Additionally, he had access to Soviet sensitive military or atomic energy information prior to emigrating to the United States in 1991.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three of four foreign preference mitigating conditions (FP MC) could potentially reduce security concerns in this case.  FP MC 1 applies where "[d]ual citizenship is based solely on parents'

<P>FP MC 1, 2 and 4 do not fully apply.  Although Applicant's Russian or Soviet citizenship was based primarily on his parent's Russian, Soviet or Moldova citizenship as well as his birth in Russia, 
there are additional indicia of foreign preference, which must be considered to avoid piecemeal application.  He briefly served in the Soviet <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">military, and he had a Russian passport until October 
2006.  Similarly, FP MC 2 has only limited applicability to his foreign military service and access to sensitive Soviet atomic or military information because they occurred before he emigrated to the 
United States and obtained U.S. citizenship. FP MC 4 </SPAN>has limited applicability because he took action to renounce his Russian citizenship. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>The Money Memorandum mandates that, "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains

rational explanation for her determination--basing it on such factors as the Applicant's strong ties and loyalties to the United States, the extensive effort undertaken by the Applicant to surrender her 
passport and renounce her Russian citizenship before the close of the record, and the fact that Applicant's lack of awareness concerning the requirements expressed in the ASDC3I memo and the 
Guideline C Mitigating Conditions may have affected the timing of her renunciation actions. There are no stated requirements in Guideline C Mitigating Condition 4 concerning when an applicant

<P>Applicant's "strong ties and loyalties to the United States" are discussed in the "whole person" section of this decision.  As indicated in ISCR Case No. 03-04300, the timing of Applicant's

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline B, </SPAN><STRONG>a "</STRONG>security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>One of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  FI DC 1 applies where an "immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN>  "Immediate family members" include a spouse, father, 
mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  Applicant's father, mother, former spouse (M) and daughter (C) are or were citizens of the Soviet Union, Russia or 
oldova.  Under the literal terms of FI DC 1, this situation creates the potential for foreign influence and could result in the compromise of classified information.  The mere possession of close 
family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>The government produced substantial evidence to establish FI DC 1 because Applicant's mother is a citizen of Moldova and C is a Russian citizen, and he has close ties of affection or obligation to 
them.  Accordingly, Applicant has the burden to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that any of the five Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) apply.  </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 1 recognizes that security concerns are reduced when there is "[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, 
or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) 
involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that Applicant must prove that his family 
members, cohabitant or associates are not agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) 
involved and the U.S.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  The first prong of FI MC 1 is met because Applicant's mother and C are not employed by or agents of the governments of Russia or Moldova.  His mother's receipt of 
social security payments from Russia ended when she emigrated to the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Second, Applicant's family members are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  His father is deceased.  Although his former wife is not "an immediate family member," and he is not 
close to her or bound to her by affection, he provides financial support to her.  The location of his mother and C's birth is the basis for their citizenship in Moldova, and Russia, respectively.  His 
mother has no relatives in Russia, Ukraine, or Moldova except for her sister.  C has a grandmother living in Russia, but they are not close, do not communicate with each other, and do not know 
each other.  Most importantly, his mother, former spouse and C all live in the United States, and are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power.  Although FI MC 1 has some 
limited applicability, it is insufficient to mitigate Guideline B security concerns.  </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where "contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant has numerous contacts by telephone 
annually with C, and she visits him several times a year.  His mother lives with Applicant.  He also provides financial support to his mother and to C. FI MC 3 does not apply because his contacts 
with them are not casual and infrequent. <EM> See </EM>ISCR Case No. 04-08870 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (stating "casual" contacts are "fortuitous" or unplanned); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with  applicant's parents and sisters in Iran a total of about 20 times per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 
26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant's siblings in Iran once every four or five months not casual and infrequent).  </P> 
 
<P>The nature of Russia's government, its mixed human rights record, its history of espionage, and its relationship with the U.S. create a significant burden of persuasion to overcome the security 
concerns raised by Applicant's frequent, non-casual contact with his mother and C, as well as his financial support of M.  These factors make it more conceivable that Russia would target its 
citizens in an attempt to gather information from the United States using coercion, persuasion, or duress.  The future relationship of Russia to the U.S. may not always be as congenial as it is today.  
The rivalry between Russia and the U.S. makes espionage probable, and Applicant has a significant burden to demonstrate that his relationships with his mother, C and M do not pose a security risk.  
He should not have the potential of being placed  in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and these two family members and M. </P> 
 
<P>After considering all the circumstances including those listed under both Guideline B, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns by applying  FI MC 1-3 
because of the necessity to avoid piecemeal analysis.  Moreover, the absence of evidence<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> under the Appeal Board's jurisprudence is of very limited probative value.  However, the circumstances 
discussed above are not determinative. These circumstances must be considered together under the "whole person concept," which is discussed in the next section, <EM>infra</EM>. </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></SPAN></P> 
</A> 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under 
Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of an applicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Moreover, "[u]nder the whole person 
concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant's life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility 
by considering the totality of an applicant's conduct and circumstances."<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN>   <BR> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors which are used for "whole person" analysis.  Because foreign influence and foreign preference do not involve misconduct, voluntariness of 
participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth and ninth adjudicative process factors (APF) are the most relevant to a Guideline B adjudication.<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>The eighth APF, "the potential

<P>Three factors weigh against approval of Applicant's clearance.  First, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Russia's government is a rival of the United States and in some instances has not conformed to widely accepted norms of 
human rights.  More importantly for security purposes, Russia is actively involved in economic espionage against the United States. </SPAN> Second, Applicant had significant connections to the Soviet 
Union especially before emigrating to the United States in 1991.  He served for one month in the Soviet military, and had access to sensitive, but unclassified military and atomic information.  
oreover, he  possessed a Russian passport until a month before his hearing.  Third, he had frequent and non-casual contact with his mother, a citizen of Moldova, and his daughter, C, a Russian 
citizen, and paid child support to his former spouse M, a Russian citizen.</P> 
 
<P>Multiple circumstances, including <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the unlikely possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress and the unlikelihood of Applicant's return to Russia, more than counterbalance these three 
factors.  </SPAN>His Russian passport was returned the Russian Federation, and Applicant advised Russia that he renounced his Russian citizenship.  He stated he would not defend Russia, even if Russia 
were attacked.  He has strong links or connections to the United States: (1) Applicant became a United States citizen in 2004, and he swore allegiance to the United States; (2) his 15-year residence 
in the United States; (3) his spouse is a U.S. citizen who resides in the United States; (4) his 6-year old daughter is a U.S. citizen who resides in the United States; (5) he owns a home and has 
financial accounts in the United States;<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN> (6) his mother lives in the United States, has applied for U.S. citizenship, and has no reason to return to Russia or Moldova; (7) his daughter C lives in the 
United States, has no reason to go to Russia or Moldova, and he intends for her to apply for U.S. citizenship; and (8) his former spouse, M, lives in the U.S. and has applied for U.S. citizenship. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In a 2006 decision, the Appeal Board held the Judge properly determined under the "whole person" concept that an applicant with very significant connections to Russia had mitigated security 
concerns under Guideline B.  In ISCR Case No. 03-04300, 2006 DOHA Lexis 264 at *17-*21 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006),<A HREF="06-15779.h2.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> the applicant had weekly contact with her mother (who lives in Russia), 
contact three times per year with her aunt (who lives in Russia); contact about four times per year with her father-in-law (who lives in Russia); and multiple annual contacts with other relatives 
living in Israel.  She had visited her family in Russia and Israel, on more than one occasion, after emigrating to the United States.  Moreover, she owned a half interest in her mother's apartment in 
Russia, and provided financial support to her mother and aunt.  The Judge's whole person analysis (that the Appeal Board determined was sufficient to mitigate such significant foreign influence 
security concerns) provides:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at all of [whole person] factors, I conclude Applicant has overcome foreign influence security concerns.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While clearance decisions are inherently based on numerous facts, and as such are made after a case-by-case analysis, it is beyond debate that the applicant in ISCR </SPAN>Case No. 03-04300 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">had more

<P><A NAME="N_29_">29. </A>I observe that there is no record evidence establishing: (1) any connection or contact between Applicant and any foreign government; (2) any financial interests between Applicant and any 
foreign nation, or any foreign business concern; (3) his failure to follow the rules or his failure to require those around him to do the same on projects requiring security clearances; (4) any lack of 
the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, or family; and (5) a problem in the areas of honesty or integrity.  I conclude, however, that the government has no burden to present such evidence, 
and the absence of evidence does not support application of any mitigating conditions.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA Lexis 229, at *39-*41 (A.J. May 17, 2006) (discussing absence 
of evidence and relationship to burden shifting).  For example, as indicated in ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 10 (App. Bd. Oct. 27,2005), there is no reason for Russia or Moldova to contact him until 
he receives access to classified information, and lack of foreign financial interests do not mitigate Guideline B security concerns based on an applicant's relationship with relatives. <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case
