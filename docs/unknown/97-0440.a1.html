<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision, dated June 12, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Statement of Reasons contained various errors; (2)
whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are erroneous; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse
security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 18, 1997 to
Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion E (Personal Conduct) and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on April 14, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision is which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The
case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="97-0440.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <U>Whether the Statement of Reasons contained various errors</U>.  Applicant addresses the SOR allegations, contending they
contain or reflect various errors.  The Board does not review the completeness or accuracy of an SOR.  Rather, the Board
reviews the Administrative Judge's decision to determine whether it contains harmful factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive,
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.  Accordingly, the Board need not address Applicant's contentions about the
SOR allegations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant also notes the Administrative Judge characterized some of the SOR allegations as duplicative and adding
nothing substantive to the SOR.  This observation by Applicant adds nothing useful to his appeal.  The Judge entered
formal findings for Applicant with respect to the SOR allegations the Judge felt were duplicative (SOR 1.m. and 2.g.).<A HREF="97-0440.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>   
Because the Judge ruled in favor of Applicant with respect to those SOR allegations, Applicant suffered no prejudice from
them.  Therefore, the Board need not address the issue of whether those SOR allegations were duplicative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are erroneous</U>.  Applicant makes a number of arguments that the
Board construes as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's erred with respect to some of his factual
findings: (a) the Judge erred by relying on Applicant's March 1997 written statement because it was coerced and contains
false admissions of wrongdoing; (b) the Judge erred by finding Applicant made false or misleading statements about the
ages of his brothers in a security questionnaire, and about his job position in an interview with a deputy sheriff; (c) the
Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified material facts on security questionnaires in March 1982, December 1989, and
January 1997, and falsified material facts in written statements he gave to government investigators in October 1982,
August 1990, and February 1992; (d) the Judge erred by finding Applicant's falsifications were in violation of 18 U.S.C.
Section 1001; and (e) the Judge erred by finding Applicant made threats of physical harm when using his amateur radio
equipment.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge erred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(a) The Board rejects Department Counsel's argument that there is <EM>no</EM> record evidence to support Applicant's claim that his
arch 1997 written statement was coerced and contains false admissions of wrongdoing.  At the hearing, Applicant gave
testimony to support his claim that he felt pressured during the March 1997 interview and told the investigators things she
wanted to hear.  Such testimony constitutes record evidence, regardless of whether the Administrative Judge found it
credible or not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must consider all the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable (Directive, Section F.3). 
A Judge is not required to accept a witness's testimony at face value merely because it is unrebutted.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case
No. 98-0123 (October 28, 1998) at p. 3.  Instead, the Judge must assess a witness's credibility and weigh the witness's
testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  In this case, the Judge did not find credible Applicant's testimony
about being pressured to tell the investigator things that were not true.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, and
giving due deference to the Judge's credibility determination (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a.), the
Board concludes it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to find the March 1997 written statement
was voluntarily given, and to rely on Applicant's admissions in that written statement.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0184
(June 16, 1998) at p. 3 (discussing factors to be considered when evaluating claim that a confession was coerced or
involuntary).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(b) In assessing Applicant's credibility, the Administrative Judge noted evidence of some incidents that reflected adversely
on Applicant's honesty and truthfulness.  Applicant's arguments on appeal concerning those incidents are based on factual
assertions that go beyond the record evidence.  As noted earlier, such assertions constitute new evidence that the Board
cannot consider.  And, in any event, the Judge did not rely solely on those incidents to reach a conclusion about
Applicant's credibility.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's negative conclusions about Applicant's credibility
are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c) During the proceedings below, Applicant vacillated between admitting and denying the alleged falsifications. 
Considering the record evidence as a whole, there is ample record evidence to support the Administrative Judge's findings
that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in connection with various personnel security questionnaires and
written statements.<A HREF="97-0440.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's appeal arguments on this issue reflect a similar vacillation on his part and fail to
demonstrate the Judge erred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(d) Given the Administrative Judge's sustainable findings about Applicant's various falsifications, it was entirely proper
for the Judge to conclude those falsifications constituted violations of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  The fact that Applicant
eventually made disclosures to the government does not retroactively negate the criminality of his multiple falsifications
under Section 1001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(e) Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's finding that he made threats of physical harm using a "ham radio." 
There is substantial record evidence to support the Judge's challenged finding.  Applicant's arguments to the contrary are
not persuasive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>. 
Applicant also contends: (a) the Administrative Judge erred by not allowing Applicant to cross-examine the investigator
who interviewed him in March 1997; (b) the Judge erred by relying on a report of investigation (ROI) to reach
conclusions unfavorable to him; (c) the Judge erred by not considering various factors that mitigated Applicant's conduct;
and (d) Applicant's 1978 drug-related offense is too old to have any current security significance.  The Board construes
these contentions as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. 
For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge erred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(a) The investigator who interviewed Applicant in March 1997 did not testify at the hearing.  Furthermore, Applicant did
not object to the admission of the March 1997 written statement which he gave to the investigator.  Therefore, Applicant's
right to cross-examine any witness against him (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 16) never arose. 
Furthermore, Applicant did not ask the Administrative Judge for an opportunity to question the investigator.  If Applicant
had wanted to question the investigator, he had the responsibility to ask the Judge for such an opportunity in a timely
manner during the proceedings below.  Under the circumstances, it is not reasonable for Applicant to claim now that the
Judge should have required the investigator to appear as a witness to allow Applicant the opportunity to question her.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(b) Applicant contends that information in a report of investigation (ROI) was relied upon by the Administrative Judge to
reach conclusions unfavorable to Applicant, in violation of Additional Procedural Guidance Item 20.  This contention
lacks merit.  Department Counsel offered no ROI as evidence against Applicant. The only ROI in the record is one that
Applicant offered as evidence.  Furthermore, when Applicant offered the ROI as an exhibit, the Judge specifically
admonished Applicant that if the ROI was admitted into evidence that it would be considered in its entirety, not just those
portions that might be favorable to Applicant.  Despite that admonishment, Applicant indicated he wanted the ROI
considered by the Judge.  Under the circumstances, it is frivolous for Applicant to contend the  Judge erred by admitting
and considering the ROI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c) Applicant contends the Administrative Judge should have found his conduct mitigated because: (1) he made good faith
disclosures to the government before he was confronted with the facts about his falsifications; (2) he has shown clear
evidence of rehabilitation; (3) his conduct was the result of disorders that are in full remission; (4) his work record is
positive and there is no evidence that he has ever had a problem with handling classified information; and (5) he has
demonstrated genuine remorse for his past misconduct and demonstrated a determination to not repeat it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c1) Applicant's reliance on Personal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 3<A HREF="97-0440.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> is misplaced.  As discussed earlier, the record
evidence supports the Administrative Judge's findings that Applicant engaged in multiple acts of falsification over a
period of several years.  Under the circumstances, it is not tenable for Applicant to contend his belated admissions were
"prompt, good-faith efforts" within the meaning of Mitigating Guideline 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c2 and c3) The Administrative Judge considered the evidence presented by Applicant and concluded that evidence was
insufficient to demonstrate that his disorders were in full remission and that there were "considerable doubts" that
Applicant had demonstrated rehabilitation.  The Judge's approach was appropriate because he must consider the record
evidence as a whole (Directive, Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable
evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0783 (August 7, 1998) at p. 5.  Furthermore, the Judge's conclusions
on the issue of Applicant's rehabilitation and the remission of his disorders reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of
the record evidence.  Applicant's appeal arguments to the contrary fail to demonstrate the Judge erred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c4) The Administrative Judge was not precluded from making an adverse decision because of Applicant's positive work
record.  Security clearance decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during duty hours.  Any
off-duty conduct that has security implications can be considered in deciding an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 97-0618 (June 11, 1998) at p. 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge's adverse decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law merely because there is no
evidence that Applicant has engaged in any security violations.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant
mishandles classified information before it can deny or revoke the applicant's access to such information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>,
420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  All that is required is proof of facts and
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not
demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified
information.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's misconduct over a period of several years provide
a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Applicant's work record and his security record did not compel the Judge, as a matter of law, to make a favorable security
clearance decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c5) The Administrative Judge considered the evidence Applicant presented in support of his claim of remorse and
rehabilitation.  The Judge concluded that evidence was not sufficient to overcome the negative implications of Applicant's
overall history of misconduct, or to satisfactorily demonstrate such misconduct was not likely to recur.  Considering the
record as a whole, the Judge's conclusion reflects a reasonable interpretation of the evidence as a whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(d) Standing alone, Applicant's 1978 drug-related offense might be deemed too dated to support an adverse security
clearance decision.  However, this case does not involve just a single isolated, dated incident of misconduct by Applicant. 
Given Applicant's overall history of misconduct over a period of years, it was entirely reasonable for the Judge to take
into account Applicant's 1978 drug-related offense.  The Judge's analysis was consistent with the "whole person" concept
and the requirement to consider the record evidence as a whole.  The Judge properly did not conduct a piecemeal
evaluation of Applicant's various acts of misconduct.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0776 (June 5, 1997) at p. 2 ("[T]he
security eligibility of an applicant cannot be meaningfully assessed by looking only at the applicant's present situation and
ignoring the applicant's past conduct.").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to
classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Applicant's multiple acts of falsification
and his history of criminal conduct provide a rational basis for the Administrative Judge's conclusion that it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although the Board sustains the Administrative Judge's ultimate disposition of this case and is unpersuaded by
Applicant's arguments on appeal, one item is worthy of note.  The Judge uses language which suggests that a diagnosis of
ADHD may be sufficient to deny an applicant a security clearance.  Any such theory should be considered with extreme
caution.  It is doubtful that a diagnosis of a mental disorder alone without facts or circumstances that have a security
dimension will be sufficient to justify denial of a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the
