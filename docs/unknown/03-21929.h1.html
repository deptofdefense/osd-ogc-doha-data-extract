<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 13, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guidelines F (financial considerations), H (drug involvement), J (criminal conduct), and E (personal conduct) why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</P> 
<P>In a written statement dated November 22, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR,  and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on 
ay 5, 2005.  Notice of the hearing was issued June 23, 2005, scheduling the hearing for July 12, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  The transcript 
(Tr.) was received July 27, 2005.</P>

<P>From 1995 through 2000, Applicant purchased and used cocaine.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  In October 1996, he completed the Air Force Substance Abuse Reorientation and Treatment 
(SART) two-week outpatient program.  As a part of SART he attended six Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  On November 17, 1997, he disclosed to Air 
Force investigators that he was a frequent user of crack-cocaine.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  From November 21, 2000 through about January 11, 2001, he was treated at a Veterans 
Administration (VA) hospital and was diagnosed as cocaine dependent.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant's criminal history includes the following:</P> 
<P>1. Misuse of a government IMPACT card.  He paid $2,000 in restitution.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>2. In August 1996, Applicant pled guilty to a DUI.  He refused a breathalyser test.  He was given a suspended imposition of sentence, ordered to spend five days 
in jail, fined $1,163, ordered to attend a DUI driving program, and placed on three years probation.  In February 1998, probation was revoked and a new order 
of probation was entered extending probation for three additional years, and he was given until August 4, 1999, to pay the balance of his fine.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>3. On September 3, 1997, he was reported to be unlawfully in possession of a rock of cocaine.  Charges were not filed but he was barred from the Air Force 
base.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Applicant denied the rock of cocaine was his.  At the time he was stopped, he had a passenger in the car and the cocaine was found on the passenger's 
side.  The officer conducting the field test dropped the entire rock of cocaine into the kit thus obliterating the evidence, resulting in no charges.  The report said 
the cocaine was found in his coat pocket.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>4. As a result of the stop on September 3, 1997, Applicant was charged with DUI on September 8, 1997.  His guilty plea resulted in three years unsupervised 
probation, ten days in jail, fines and fees totaling $1,589, and he was ordered to attend a drinking driver's school.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>5. On September 1, 1999, he entered a guilty plea to 18 counts of uttering checks with insufficient funds.  He paid $1,371 in fines, restitution, court costs, and 
fees.  He was ordered to attend a bad check class and placed on six months unsupervised probation.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>6. Applicant was again charged with six violations of the bad checks law and posted bond in the amount of $654.33 to include restitution, costs, and fines.  On 
arch 15, 2001, he failed to appear in court and bond was forfeited.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's period of drug and alcohol abuse followed a period of time in which he and his wife had four children die at childbirth, and two more children were 
stillborn.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  </P> 
<P>In 1997, he assisted law enforcement authorities is shutting down five crack houses.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has received financial counseling for over three years, established a plan of debt management, and with the assistance of his mother and aunt, has 
paid off all delinquent debts.  He continues to see his financial counselor.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>His wife is on active duty with the Air Force and was transferred to a near-eastern European country, departing on the day of the hearing, July 12, 2005.  The 
assignment is for fifteen months.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant successfully completed the Psychiatric Addiction Treatment Program (P.A.T.) on January 11, 2001.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  He attends Narcotics Anonymous and he is 
accountable to three men, including his pastor, talking with them at least three times a week.  He counsels weekly with a psychiatrist.  These persons help him 
stay clean from alcohol and drugs, which he has successfully maintained for 4 ½ years.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The security manager with Applicant's employer wrote this about him.</P> 
<P>In the four years I have known him, I have been impressed with his dedication to any endeavor he has been involved with.  He demonstrates a giving and 
generous nature, willing to put forth the extra effort to get the job done.  He has also demonstrated honesty, reliability, and proved to be very dependable while 
performing his daily duties.  He has received several awards and was recognized by the Air Force Inspector General during a 2004 baseline inspection.  From a 
personal perspective I do not see any indications of security concerns.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  The 
President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates 
loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting 
allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information."<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  
Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-21929.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts</EM>; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H: <EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. 
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information</EM>; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: <EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,</EM> <EM>reliability and trustworthiness</EM>; and </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: <EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><STRONG>Financial Considerations. </STRONG> The security concern arising from financial difficulties is that "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds." <EM> </EM>The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) 1 arises where there is <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>.  Similarly, FC DC 3 applies 
where the information shows an <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</EM>  The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on several accounts incurred during the last six years.  I conclude that FC DC 1 and FC DC 3 apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The Regulation sets out financial considerations mitigating condition 
(FC MC) 4 that applies where <EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control</EM>.  The available evidence indicates Applicant has  received counseling for his financial problems.  He established a plan and with 
the help of family members has paid all delinquent accounts.  He is following his debt management plan established through his counselor.  He is attempting to 
contact several creditors for whom there is no information on his credit reports.  Further monitoring could ensure compliance.  I conclude FC MC 4 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC 6 may apply where <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad debts.</EM>  All but three unknown 
creditors are paid and his other obligations are kept current.  Applicant is continuing efforts to contact the credit agencies to locate these disputed accounts.  I 
believe in time he will be successful in arranging a repayment plan.  FC MC 6 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is also important to consider other factors discussed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant took the most important step when he realized he could not handle his finances without assistance and turned to a financial counselor for help.  He 
has repaid delinquent accounts, and I believe with his accountability to his financial counselor, he will continue to handle his finances in a prudent manner.  
While most of his financial problems are a direct result of his past drug and alcohol abuse, it appears that Applicant has made significant and permanent 
behavioral changes regarding his finances, drugs, and alcohol, and that he will have these problems under control in the future.  Certainly, the assistance of his 
NA support group will also provide him accountability and is an important factor in predicting future compliance.  Balancing all the information, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Drug Involvement.  </STRONG>The Government has established its case under Guideline H.  Applicant admitted the use of crack cocaine and cocaine over about a four to 
five year period, ending when he entered a drug counseling program in November 2000.  Drug involvement disqualifying conditions (DI DC) that could raise a 
security concern include DI DC 1 <EM>Any drug abuse,</EM> and DI DC 2 <EM>Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or 
distribution</EM>, and they are applicable in this case.  The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability 
to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information. The purchase and use classify Applicant as an abuser. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation. However, such silence does not means I have unfettered discretion in 
deciding what period of time is sufficient to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation. The sufficiency or insufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without 
recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather a 
reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence record within the parameters 
set by the Directive.  Applicant's last use occurred approximately in the October - November 2000 time frame.  This is not recent use.  Applicant has expressed 
he will not use illegal drugs in the future. Even if an applicant is sincere that he has no intention of using drugs in the future, I am not precluded from 
considering his statement in light of the record evidence as a whole in deciding whether the applicant is likely to adhere to such a commitment in the future. As 
a matter of common sense and human experience, people do not always successfully adhere to the promise to reform or change their conduct or lifestyle. 
Applicant successfully completed a P.A.T. program in January 2001, and has been drug free since.  What is most compelling is his attendance at NA meetings.  
His continued counseling with three individuals to help keep him accountable for success with NA is the best evidence of rehabilitation and the desire to remain 
drug free.  I  had the  opportunity to personally observe Applicant and evaluate his demeanor and veracity and make a favorable credibility determination. I 
make a favorable determination concerning his future intent. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">drug involvement mitigating condition DI MC 3 <EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse and 
drugs in the future</EM> applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used cocaine over a 4-5-year time span.  The record contains medical evidence that confirms cocaine dependence.  His drug involvement was a 
period of aberrational behavior.  Applicant had an exemplary record before 1995 -1996 and after 2000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Because about five years has elapsed since his last drug 
use and his commitment with NA</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I find DI MC 1 <EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM> is applicable.  Therefore, I find Guideline H for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct.  </STRONG> The security concern under Guideline J (criminal conduct) is that someone who willingly disregards the law may also disregard rules and 
procedures intended to safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Criminal conduct disqualifying condition CC DC 1 <EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged </EM>applies. <EM> </EM><A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SUP></A><A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted his conduct.  Applicant's criminal history conduct is confined to actions 
occurring between 1996 and 2000.  The DUI convictions and the misuse of the IMPACT card occurred prior to 1998.  The bad checks occurred in 1999 and 
2000, the last court date in March 2001.  His drug and alcohol abuse was responsible for his conduct, and although it is not an excuse, it does explain why he 
reverted to irresponsible behavior during this time.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegation of SOR &para; 1.r.  Because the arresting officer destroyed the evidence by placing the entire rock of cocaine in the field test kit, 
there was no opportunity to have the evidence analyzed by a certified laboratory to determine its chemical properties.  I find for Applicant on this issue.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions that apply are criminal conduct mitigating condition CC MC 1<EM> The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>, and CC MC 6 <EM>There is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>. The last criminal record was in March 2001 for bad checks.  There is no evidence of when those checks were written but it 
appears it was some time prior to his entry into the drug rehabilitation program in November 2000.  His involvement with NA and his continued counseling to 
keep himself accountable lead me to conclude that drug or alcohol traffic offenses are not likely to occur in the future.  Because he has addressed his delinquent 
debts and is continuing to seek assistance with a financial counselor, he has demonstrated his rehabilitation and it is unlikely that crimes involving bad checks 
or misuse of government credit cards will again occur.  His criminal activity was five years ago.  Since then he has been successfully employed and doing 
commendable work for his employer.  His employer's security officer stated her belief in his trustworthiness, his care in safeguarding classified information,  
and her recommendation that he be granted a security clearance because she had no security concerns about Applicant.  On balance, I conclude Guideline J for  
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct. </STRONG> Under Guideline E, a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.  Personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) include PC DC 4 <EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that 
increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, 
professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail, </EM>and PC DC 5 <EM>A pattern of dishonesty.  </EM>The government established a <EM>prima 
facie </EM>case against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because of his financial problems, his drug abuse and his criminal activity.  Applicant has been forthright 
about his conduct, and is not a legitimate target for coercion or blackmail.  Personal conduct mitigating condition PC MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The individual has taken positive 
steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM> applies.  All three issues have been discussed above and do not need 
to be repeated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has put his period of financial irresponsibility, his drug and alcohol abuse, and his criminal activity behind him.  All three concerns 
were necessitated due to his drug abuse.  As he has a substantial period being drug free and his continuation with NA, I believe he no longer is a security risk.  
Accordingly, I conclude the SOR allegations under Guideline E for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3.  To me, this record raises no reasonable or persistent doubts 
about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government 
entrusts its interests.  Because of the nature of the conduct and his efforts at mitigation, I  conclude he has overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
