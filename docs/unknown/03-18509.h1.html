<P>Applicant's financial problems continue to raise security concerns over his failure to resolve four debts totaling approximately $21,000. The record evidence is

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 29, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-18509.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Security concerns 
were raised under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations). DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On December 22, 2004, I was assigned the case. On January 6, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing held on January 26, 2005. At that hearing, it was determined Applicant was not informed of the hearing time and 
location in a timely manner.  The hearing was continued.  On March 11, 2005, a second Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held 
on March 28, 2005. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Several documents were received and admitted into the 
record. On February 3, 2005 and April 7, 2005, DOHA received copies of the transcripts (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits owing five debts totaling approximately $22,000. That admission is incorporated herein as a findings of fact.  
After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional finding of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44 year old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since December 2004, and is seeking a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant incurred three credit card debts (SOR 1.a, $1,316 and SOR 1.b, $2,566, SOR 1.c, $7,755).  From March 1999 to August 1999, Applicant was 
unemployed.  He was unable to pay his credit card bills while unemployed. Once he was employed, he discovered the debts had been charged off.  
Additionally, he was unable to catch up on his bad debts once he was again employed because he had two children in college.  The state paid their tuition, but 
Applicant paid for their food, lodging, room, board, and books. (Tr. 40)  Applicant's daughter, who is 24 years old, has 85% hearing loss, and his son, who is 
22 years old, has 60% hearing loss (Tr. 26). He has incurred medical expenses due to their hearing impairment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant says his one credit card debt (SOR 1.c) has been transferred to various collection agencies.  The amount listed on his February 2004 credit report 
(Gov Ex 3) is $11,656.  Applicant states the debt was actually $7,755. (Tr. 31) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1989 or 1990, Applicant had a home repossessed. He was working for a government contractor when laid off and unable to find a job for 10 months (Gov 
Ex 1, p 3).  In 1996, Applicant entered into an agreement to do some design work for an individual. The two worked together until 1999. The agreement 
required a 60-40% division of all profits. No profits were ever realized.  Applicant borrowed $4,000 from the individual when his daughter started college. 
When the money was not repaid, the individual obtained a $4,000 judgment (SOR 1.e) against Applicant.  Applicant has bitter feelings about this transaction. 
(Tr. 41) He did not believe the money was a loan when he received it. He indicates this will be the last debt paid. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2003, Applicant was questioned about his finances and past due debts (Gov Ex 2).  At that time, he said he would repay the debt sometime after 
January 2005.  Applicant stated his children would be out of college by December 2004, which would free up "a lot of money." (Gov Ex 2, p 2) He planned to 
contact his creditors in January 2005 and establish repayment plans.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had developed no repayment plan.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2004, Applicant responded to financial interrogatories (Gov Ex 3).  At that time, he had a verbal agreement to refinance his house in October 2004 
and would provide enough money to offer settlements on his debts. The refinancing did not occur. Applicant has established a credit union account.  In the 
future, he intends to make direct deposits into the account and then use the funds in the account to settle his debts.  Applicant did not document the balance of 
this account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's daughter has taken over repayment of her debts, which include a car payment and insurance payment.  Applicant has paid off two trucks, which 
provides him with $600 per month he can devote to his debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR lists five debts totaling approximately $ 22,000 owed to five creditors.  A summary of those debts and their current status follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2003, Applicant submitted a monthly financial statement showing his monthly net remainder was a negative $440 (Gov Ex 2). In March 2004, he 
submitted another statement showing a positive $83 net remainder.  Following the hearing, Applicant submitted a financial statement showing $176 net 
remainder plus $200 dedicated to savings and $200 dedicated to debt reduction. (App Ex A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's yearly salary is $66,000 and his wife's yearly income is $26,000. He is not currently being contacted by creditors concerning past due debts.  He 
has no credit cards.  He has not received any credit counseling. (Tr. 35)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicants which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case. Additionally, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-18509.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy V. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information to be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under 
agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties 
is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. Under Guideline F, an Applicant is not required to be debt free, but is 
required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds. Directive, E.2.A.6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant admitted he owed five debts totaling 
approximately $22,000.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and DC 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is current on his mortgage payments.  I find for him as to SOR 1.d. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in the Applicant's favor to the other four debts. MC 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not 
apply because the conduct is recent since the debts remain unpaid. MC 2 (E2.A6.1.2.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> It was an isolated incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not apply because there are four 
unpaid debts. There was no showing the debts were caused by factors beyond Applicant's control. Applicant was unemployed for 10 months in 1989 or 1990 
and unemployed for six months from March 1999 through August 1999.  Subsequently, Applicant has been employed for more than five and one half years; 
and there is no showing of payments having been made on the listed debts. He has had additional medical expenses due to his children's hearing loss, but he 
failed to document the impact of these expenses on his current finances. Because Applicant has failed to document the impact of the additional medical 
expenses and the impact of his unemployment five years ago on his current finances, I find MC3 (E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>) 
does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There has been no showing Applicant has received financial counseling nor is there any indication his financial difficulties are under control.  Therefore, MC4 
(E2.A6.1.3.4. <EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control</EM>) does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> For MC 6 (E2.A6.1.2.6.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) to apply there must be an "ability" 
to repay the debts, the "desire" to repay, and evidence of a good faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is not present. 
Following the hearing, Applicant was going to establish an account to which he would make systematic deposits. At some future date, he would then use those 
accumulated funds to offer settlement on his four debts.  He has failed to document the account or its balance.  Of more importance, Applicant has yet to make 
any payment on these debts.  He was first made aware of the government's concern during a May 2003 interview, and he has yet to make any payment.  
Because he has failed to document payment on the four debts, I find against Applicant on these debts.  I find against Applicant as to financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
