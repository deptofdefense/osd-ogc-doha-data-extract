<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>On January 27, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense Industrial</EM>
<EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 4, 1997, and requested a hearing before
a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on April 30,
1997.  On June 4, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether it was
clearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant's security clearance.  The
Government's case consisted of four exhibits and one witness; Applicant relied on his own
testimony, on the testimony of four additional witnesses, and on ten exhibits.  A transcript of the
proceedings was received on June 17, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Applicant has admitted, with an explanation, the single factual allegation set forth in the SOR
under Criterion E; he has denied, with an explanation, the single factual allegation set forth in the
SOR under Criterion J. I have accepted Applicant's admission and have incorporated it as part of
my findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon
due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	Applicant is a 43 years old and has been employed as Ship's Master<A HREF="97-0025.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> in the U.S. Merchant
arine since 1990.  Prior to becoming a Ship's Master, he has worked as a Merchant Seaman,
beginning as an "ordinary seaman" in 1976 and working up to his present position.  He has held a
secret clearance since 1982.</P>

<P>	A question has arisen about Applicant's security clearance eligibility because of his 1991
involvement in a scheme organized by Company X--his employer at the time--to defraud the
United States Government.  Company X was a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor in the
business of operating ships for the Department of the Navy ------------------------------.  Applicant had
actively participated in this scheme shortly after he became the Ship's Master of the USNS Z. 
Applicant had taken over as the Ship's Master at a time when Company X was having severe
financial problems.  In order to continue operations, Applicant, other Ship's Masters, and other
employees had been instructed to submit time sheets claiming payment for corrective maintenance
overtime when the employees--on whose behalf the claims were being submitted--were actually
providing on-board</P>

<P>services which did not properly fall under the category of "corrective maintenance."  Applicant's
employer had resorted to this scheme because costs for corrective maintenance overtime were an
additional cost to the contract that could be passed on directly to the U.S. Navy, whereas costs for
other routine maintenance and repairs had to be absorbed under the original contract price.  As a
result of their initiating and participating in this fraudulent scheme, eight employees<A HREF="97-0025.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> of Company
X were indicted by the U.S. Attorney for State Y on criminal charges (Tr. 73). Seven employees of
Company X were convicted (Tr. 118). Although none of  those convicted were incarcerated,
Company X has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Treasury 1.4 million dollars as the result of a civil
proceeding (Tr. 102-103).</P>

<P>	Applicant had become the Ship's Master of the USNS  Z on January 24, 1991 (Tr. 155).  The
USNS  Z was in the Mediterranean Port of Q; there was a war in the Persian Gulf.<A HREF="97-0025.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  When Applicant
took over as the Ship's Master, he learned that time sheets claiming reimbursement for corrective
maintenance overtime were being sent back (Tr. 198-201); he also learned that his employer was in
dire financial straits (Tr. 157,175).  And he learned that submitting time sheets fraudulently claiming
overtime for corrective maintenance was the means to which his employer had resorted in order to
continue operations (Tr. 159).  Applicant actively participated in this scheme because he did not see
an alternative--at that time.  Key members of the ship's crew were threatening to leave if they did
not receive additional compensation, i.e., overtime (Tr. 159).  Applicant recalled a specific occasion
when he asked his chain of command within Company X how to respond to crew members who
were threatening to jump ship if they did not receive overtime.  Applicant was instructed to pay
whatever overtime was requested and to write it up properly (Tr. 159).  The ship could not legally
leave port without a full crew (Tr. 158).  Applicant did not feel comfortable going outside of his
chain of command to the ------------------------ (Tr. 159);  he was concerned what abandoning ship
would do for his career--so he participated.  His participation included signing off on time sheets
which he knew contained false information and changing entries on time sheets to reflect corrective
maintenance entries, rather than entries which reflected the work that had actually been performed
(Tr. 182-183, Govt. Exh. No. 3).  Applicant continued as the Ship's Master of the USNS Z until July
14, 1991, and continued to work for Company X until February 1993.</P>

<P>	When Applicant was questioned about his involvement in the fraudulent scheme by the
Defense Investigative Service (DIS), he was honest and forthright in admitting the full extent of his
involvement (see Govt. Exh. No. 4).  While he has provided an extensive account of the environment
in which his participation in the scheme to defraud the U.S. Government had occurred, he has never
attempted to argue that those circumstances justified his actions.  At the hearing, he admitted again
that he "was ultimately responsible for what went on." and that he could not "give... an excuse for
anything what went on," (Tr. 174,189).   He testified that since the events aboard the USNS Z, he
has "gone to extreme measures to make sure that it has never happened again with me."  Now he
insists "upon clarification of orders from... superiors."  If he were ever in a similar situation again,
he testified  that he "would now definitely call the NIS immediately" (Tr. 174). </P>

<P>	Since the fraudulent scheme was uncovered in 1991, Applicant has continued to work as a
Ship's Master for Company X, and later for Companies Y and Z.  There is no evidence that he has
been involved in any questionable or suspicious activity other than that which occurred aboard the
USNS Z.  Most of those who have come to know him through personal contact, as well as those who
know him primarily by reputation, indicated that they were aware of events aboard the USNS Z.  Of
the individuals who had knowledge of those events, none of them expressed any doubts or
reservations about Applicant's having a security clearance.  All of his character references have
praised him as a man of honesty and integrity. (Tr. 17-30, 31-40, 213-217. Appl. Exhs. Ltrs.
B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I, and J).  </P>

<P>	Two of the witnesses who testified on Applicant's behalf were in positions which required
them to be knowledgeable of his (Applicant's) character and reputation.  Captain N is a Naval Officer
with almost 30 years of commissioned service--currently the commanding officer of the Naval
Oceanographic Service.  Captain N had become acquainted with Applicant when he served as Ship's
aster on one of their ships during a survey mission.  He was favorably impressed with Applicant 
when he met him prior to the mission and had an opportunity to watch him "in action."  Captain N
later received positive feedback--about Applicant-- during formal debriefing from the crew that
had conducted the survey.  Captain N described Applicant as a "man of integrity, a man of his word." 
(Tr. 31-33).<A HREF="97-0025.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Mr. J is the vice president of the -------------------------.  His organization supplies
personnel to the companies that operate "TAGOS"<A HREF="97-0025.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> and oceanographic ships for the U.S. Navy.  Mr.
J testified that his company prides itself in sending quality people to operate the Navy's ships.
Although aware of the events aboard the USNS Z, Mr. J testified that Applicant has an "outstanding
reputation."  (Tr. 213-220). </P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving
any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate that the facts proven have a
nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion E)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness
to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard
classified information.  </P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security clearance concern and may be disqualifying also
include:</STRONG></P>

<P> 	(6)	Association with persons involved in criminal activity.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(7)	Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion J)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability
and trustworthiness.</P>

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(1)	Any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	(2)	A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(1) 	The criminal behavior was not recent;</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	(2)	The crime was an isolated incident;</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	(4)	The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the

<P> 	(5)	There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ADJUDICATIVE PROCESS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>The<STRONG> </STRONG>following Adjudicative Process factors have been considered:</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The<STRONG> </STRONG>nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The<STRONG> </STRONG>circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The<STRONG> </STRONG>voluntariness of participation</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The<STRONG> </STRONG>presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P><STRONG>	-	</STRONG>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P> </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>.      	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria E and J.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	Applicant's admitted, active participation in a scheme to defraud the U.S. Government--
together with other evidence in the record--establish his involvement in a serious criminal
conspiracy.  Through his participation in this conspiracy, Applicant demonstrated extremely poor
judgment and failed to comply with applicable rules and regulations.  His conduct was especially
serious because it continued for almost six months.  During that time, there is little evidence that he
attempted to report the criminal activity, or that he took steps to extricate himself from the situation
in which he felt compelled to participate.  The scheme in which he was participating would
eventually defraud the U.S. Government of more than two million dollars.  Although Applicant did
not devise the scheme and was not a major player in its execution, the scheme would not have
succeeded--for the time that it did--had it not been for his complicity and the complicity of others
similarly situated.</P>

<P>	While Applicant did participate in serious criminal activity, there were persuasive
extenuating and mitigating circumstances.  It is significant that Applicant's participation in the
criminal conspiracy occurred six years ago, at a time shortly after he had assumed the duties of S------------ for the first time.  He was in a foreign port; he wanted to keep his crew together; and he was
afraid of going outside the chain of command.  He could not walk off the job, jump in his car, and
drive to his home in the suburbs.  And he obviously did not have the confidence in his own instincts
that longer tenure in that position would have given him.  He was overly concerned with establishing
a reputation for being able to accomplish the mission under adverse conditions.  Just as Applicant
was in the throes of adjusting to the responsibilities of a new position, his employer was engaged
in a massive conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government of millions of dollars by submitting false
vouchers for corrective maintenance overtime.  Applicant was swept along in this conspiracy; he
exercised poor judgment.</P>

<P>	Had Applicant been involved in this conspiracy six months ago, or even two years ago, there
would not have been sufficient time for him to re-establish his reputation, and provide a basis for
concluding his poor judgment on that occasion was an "isolated" event in Applicant's career. 
However, it has been six years.   During those six years, Applicant has continued to serve as a ------
------; he has established a reputation as a man of integrity.  The time that has passed since the
incident together with Applicant's unblemished prior record have served to isolate the events of early
1991 from an otherwise exemplary career.  Applicant's record, before and after his tenure as the ------------- of the ---- Z, corroborates his account of those events and persuades this Administrative Judge
that he stumbled because of the difficult circumstances--not because of a criminal predisposition,
a deep rooted character flaw or ingrained poor judgment.</P>

<P>	Favorable consideration has been given to the fact that Applicant did not personally profit
from his participation in the criminal conspiracy.  Nor did he did participate in the conspiracy to
obtain funds to cover gambling debts or to support an alcohol or drug habit.  He benefited only to
the extent that participating in the conspiracy enabled him to keep his job whereas refusing to
participate may well have caused his employment to be terminated. Also given favorable
consideration is that fact that Applicant did not play any role in devising the fraudulent scheme in
which he felt compelled to participate.</P>

<P>	Finally, Applicant impressed this Administrative Judge with his honesty and sincerity.  He
came across as being truly sorry and embarrassed about what he had done.  He has accepted full
responsibility for his actions. Since the events aboard the ---- Z, he has thought about the
circumstances under which he submitted the fraudulent corrective maintenance overtime sheets and
realizes  there was a way out of the dilemma that he did not think of at the time.  This reflection
about the past has caused him to think about what he would do if he were in a similar situation in
the future.  He knows that he does not want to make the same mistake again.  Because he has never
attempted to avoid his responsibility, his testimony about his future intentions is credible, as was his
testimony about the work environment under which he had been drawn into the criminal conspiracy.</P>

<P>	Department Counsel is correct in pointing out that none of the character witnesses who
testified on Applicant's behalf have had extensive one-on-one contact with him.  However, that fact
appears to be a function of what he does, rather than who he is.  Being responsible for a ship on the
high seas is not a job which lends itself to frequent contact with one's supervisors, or with anyone
except the ship's crew--whose testimony would automatically be suspect because of their being
subordinate.  Although the men who have attested to Applicant's character and reputation may not
have had day-to-day contact with him, at least two of them--Captain N and Mr. J--have a vested
interest in being informed about his trustworthiness, honesty and integrity.  These are men of
substance, holding responsible positions.  Because their own reputations and authority are on the
line, their knowledge about Applicant is necessarily based on something more substantial than idle
curiosity.  Their positions require them to make decisions about Applicant's career or to influence
the decisions made by others.  It is unlikely that they will base those decisions or their
recommendation of Applicant on speculation or conjecture.  They have no professional interest in
promoting the reputation and career of someone who is a liar, or who has proven himself to be
untrustworthy.  And there is no evidence that they were touting Applicant's reputation because of
friendship or family ties.  Subparagraph 1.a. (Criterion E) and subparagraph 2.a. (Criterion J) are
concluded for Applicant.</P>
