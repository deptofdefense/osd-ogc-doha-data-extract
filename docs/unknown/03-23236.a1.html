<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On December 3, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) 
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992 as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 20, 2005, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions as to Guideline C (Foreign Preference), are 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, since, in Applicant's opinion, he has not exercised dual citizenship, has not used his Iranian passport, and has not 
traveled to Iran since 1978.<A HREF="03-23236.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant also points out that he submitted his passport to his employer, and he has provided a letter from his employer to that 
effect.<A HREF="03-23236.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he held dual citizenship, that he had obtained an Iranian passport thirteen years after he became an 
American citizen and obtained an American passport, and that he had been reluctant to relinquish the Iranian passport in case he should need to travel to Iran.  
At the hearing, Applicant stated that he would be willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship and relinquish his Iranian passport, but had not tried to do so 
because he had been told he would be required to travel to Iran and take those actions in an Iranian court.  The Judge was not required to accept Applicant's 
unsupported testimony.<A HREF="03-23236.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  Although Applicant demonstrated that he had submitted his passport to his employer, the Judge concluded 
that action did not constitute an effective surrender.  Indeed, the Judge found Applicant previously retrieved the passport from the security office of his 
employer and later placed it back in their custody.  Applicant's failure to provide evidence of any action taken to renounce his Iranian citizenship and relinquish 
his Iranian passport to proper authorities provides adequate support for the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.  Thus, the 
Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.</P>

<P>The decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
