<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On August 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-26585.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-26585.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> issued a Statement Reasons
(SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations).  The SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant him access to classified information and recommends that his case be
submitted to an Administrative Judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	On October 30, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was
assigned to me on January 8, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 23, 2004 and the
hearing was held on February 12, 2004.  During the hearing, six Government exhibits (Govt Ex), six
Applicant exhibits (Ap Ex) and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses, including Applicant,
were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on February 24, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Without objection by Department Counsel, I granted Applicant until February 26, 2004 to
provide documentation of his satisfaction of delinquent indebtedness.  Applicant provided a

</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of
fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

employee.  He is also a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve and is a volunteer fireman in his
community.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was divorced from his first wife in 1994 and ordered to pay child support for his
child.  The current amount of that child support garnished from his pay is approximately $576.00
per month.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	In January 1994, applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Applicant's debts in the
amount of $15,826.00 were subsequently discharged. (SOR ¶ 1.a).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	In 1996, Applicant purchased a pre-owned automobile from a automobile dealer.  It was

(SOR ¶ 1.c).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

and he has not paid the $2,154.00 he owes on the account (SOR ¶ 1.b).  Applicant has been unable
to contact the creditor or any successor.    </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	In 1998, Applicant financed the purchase a pickup truck.  At the end of 1999 or beginning

was $2,566.00.  Applicant reached an agreement with the finance company to pay back the debt at
the rate of $25.00 per month.  Applicant made $25.00 payments in January and February 2004 (SOR
¶ 1.f).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was divorced from his second wife in 2000 and ordered to pay child support. 
Approximately $292.00 per month in support payments are garnished from his pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

over for collection in May 2001.  On February 23, 2004, Applicant paid the debt collector $452.62

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant incurred a $68.00 debt for cellular service that he did not pay.  The debt was
referred for collection in September 2001.  On September 5, 2003, Applicant paid the debt (SOR ¶
1.h).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	After receiving the SOR, Applicant obtained the assistance of a credit counselor.  She

his financial affairs.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is currently paying approximately $303.00 per month in child support to the

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The concern is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to
engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include E2.A6.1.2.1, a history of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying
Condition 1).  They also include E2.A6.1.2.3, inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts
(Disqualifying Condition 3).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A6.1.3.4, the person has received

resolved or is under control (Mitigating Condition 4).  They also include E2.A6.1.3.6, the individual

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The evidence in the record of Applicant's delinquent indebtedness substantiates SOR ¶ 1.a
through SOR ¶ 1.i.  It demonstrates Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations, as well
as his inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 1 and Disqualifying
Condition 3).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The record indicates that Applicant has had financial problems for more than a decade.  In
conjunction with his divorce from his first wife, he obtained a Chapter 7 discharge in bankruptcy in
1994 that relieved him from approximately $15,826.00 of indebtedness.  With each of his divorces,
Applicant incurred child support obligations and is now paying child support to the mother of a third
child as well.  His current child support obligations of approximately $1,171.00 per month are
undoubtedly a strain on meeting his financial obligations.  The record reflects that for the most part,
Applicant  ignored the delinquent debts addressed by the SOR until confronted with this case. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	However, after receiving the SOR, Applicant obtained the assistance of a credit counselor
and has repaid nearly all of his delinquent indebtedness.  Of the $11,213.00 of unsatisfied
indebtedness addressed by SOR, Applicant has completely resolved $6,543.00.  Moreover, he has
reached an agreement and has begun making payments to satisfy an additional $2,566.00 following
the repossession of his truck (SOR ¶ 1.f).  Applicant has paid six of those eight debts and has
reached an agreement and begun paying off a seventh.<A HREF="02-26585.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  There is only one debt he has not resolved
that amounts to $2,154.00 (SOR ¶ 1.b).  The debt results from an expensive vacuum cleaner that his
second wife insisted he purchase from a door-to-door salesman.  Based on the information supplied
in his credit reports, Applicant has not been able to contact the finance company for the vacuum
cleaner company.  Under these circumstances, Applicant should not be denied a security clearance
for the failure to resolve this debt.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's state tax liability was satisfied from his latest federal income tax refund (SOR
¶ 1.i).  He paid off his debt for wireless phone service (SOR ¶ 1.h).  Applicant reached a settlement
agreement and paid off his debt resulting from the repossession of his car (SOR ¶ 1.c).  He also
reached a settlement agreement on the medical bill and paid it off (SOR ¶ 1.d and e).  Applicant paid
his cable service bill in full (SOR ¶ 1.g).  In addition, Applicant paid $452.62 in settlement of a
delinquent credit card account that is not addressed by the SOR. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant has paid or is paying his delinquent indebtedness.  He has sufficient income to pay
his debts and expenses.  Moreover, he is obtaining assistance from a credit counselor at a credit
union to better manage his financial affairs.  Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant.  </SPAN></P>
