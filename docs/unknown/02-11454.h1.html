<P>Applicant's only alcohol-related incident, a Minor in Possession of Alcohol, occurred in 1994, when he was 19 years of age. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's consumption of 
alcohol was at times, in excess and to the point of intoxication, it has diminished significantly</SPAN>. Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is sufficient to 
mitigate his alcohol related history.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be 
granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated June 16, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. On September 8, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
filed no response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 27, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-6), which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary evidence into 
the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline G (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">) of the Directive. The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., under 
Guideline G.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 28 year old employee of a defense contractor, who seeks a security clearance on behalf of Applicant. He is divorced and has no children. He 
received a Bachelor of Science Degree in 1998.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has consumed alcohol since he was 16 years of age.  Initially he consumed approximately four 12 ounce bottles of beer on a weekend, two times a 
month. In 1997, as a result of a more stressful life his consumption increased to four 12 ounce bottles of beer, one or two times a week. In 1998, during the 
period of being separated from his then current wife his alcohol consumption fluctuated between as few as one or two beers every other day to as many as 
twelve beers in a day (Exhibit 6). Applicant continues to consume alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1994, as a result of walking home from a party with a cup of beer in his possession, Applicant was arrested for Minor in Possession of Alcohol.  He plead 
guilty and paid a fine. (Exhibit 6). This is the only alcohol related incident in Applicant's background.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has received therapy for a number of issues including depression, sex addiction and related excessive consumption of alcohol. He has attended 
substance and addictive behavior education classes (Exhibit 6). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">No medical records were introduced into evidence. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use; (E2.A7.1.2.1.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment; (E2.A7.1.2.5.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem; (E2.A7.1.3.2.).<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot 
draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive 
Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG>In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving that Applicant has used alcohol to 
excess (Guideline G). On the other hand, Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome 
the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant's alcohol consumption  resulted in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> one alcohol related incident, which occurred in 1994, and involved 19 year old Applicant carrying a cup of beer 
on a street. Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess, from 1991 to the present.  He has consumed as many as 12 bottles of beer in one day. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As to the amount of alcohol he now consumes, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> stated, in a response to interrogatories, signed under oath on March 25, 2003, that he currently drinks 
at a rate of six to nine glasses of beer or mixed drinks per week (Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government established that Applicant was involved in one alcohol-related incident away from work, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1. He has, at 
times, been involved in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, which is DC 5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> However, Applicant's consumption of 
alcohol has diminished significantly.  He now consumes far less alcohol, no more than </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">six to nine glasses of beer or mixed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">drinks during any week, and the only 
alcohol related incident in Applicant's life occurred ten years ago. Applicant has presented credible evidence to support a conclusion that he has reformed his 
habit. Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 applies.  As there has been no medical evidence introduced into this case, I cannot conclude that he is, or has been 
diagnosed as an alcoholic or alcohol dependent. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for Applicant as to the allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
