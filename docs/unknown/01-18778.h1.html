<P>Applicant incurred debts during his marriage while he and his spouse both earned incomes.  After he retired from the military, and was divorced, he could not 
pay the debts.  Applicant filed for bankruptcy, as did his former wife, and was discharged from his obligations.  He currently handles his debt obligations 
responsibly.  Applicant mitigated the financial concerns and it is clearly consistent with security clearance concerns to issue a clearance.  Clearance granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
<P>On November 26, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under the personal security Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge 
to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated December 26, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested a hearing.  This case was originally 
assigned to Administrative Judge Roger Willmeth on February 3, 2003, but was reassigned to me on February 12, 2003 due to caseload considerations.  On 
February 12, 2003 a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing date for March 7, 2003.  On that date I convened the hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented four exhibits<A HREF="01-18778.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>, all of which were admitted into 
evidence. Applicant appeared and testified, and offered four exhibits<A HREF="01-18778.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>, all of which were admitted into evidence.  Applicant was given two weeks until March 
21, 2003 to submit a copy of his bankruptcy documents.  He did submit those documents on time.  I received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on March 18, 
2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h. of the SOR.  He denied subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR.  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the 
same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant retired from the U.S. Navy in a senior enlisted grade in August, 1996.  He is 54 years old.  Applicant is currently drawing retired pay.  Applicant got 
divorced in April, 1998.  He has two daughters, ages 26 and 22.  Applicant is employed as an office manager for a defense contractor.  This position requires a 
security clearance.  Applicant held security clearances during his active military service. (Tr.14, 18, 54; Applicant Exhibits A and B) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant's financial problems arose after his retirement from military service.  He did not find a job which allowed him to pay his bills.  His family income 
with his former wife at one time reached $64,000 annually.  After he retired and got divorced, his single income was not sufficient to pay the debts incurred on 
a two person income basis.  For a two year period from 1996 until 1998 Applicant could not pay his bills and got into financial difficulty.  Some of the debts 
were incurred jointly with his former wife.  Some of the debts dated back to 1980, and he had been paying the minimum payment on them since then. 
Applicant's former wife filed for bankruptcy.  Applicant did not use his credit cards after 1996 and did not open any new accounts.  He does have a store credit 
card and a gas credit card. (Tr. 14, 37, and 38, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54; Gov't. Exhibit 3 at 1, 2, and 22)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant filed for bankruptcy in June, 1998, but did not complete the bankruptcy because he was not satisfied with the service he obtained from the lawyers 
and the bankruptcy advisor he hired.  Applicant stated on his security clearance application (Question 33) that he filed for bankruptcy in June, 1998, but he 
never followed up that statement with proof that he completed the bankruptcy.  He did state in the "General Remarks" section that the court date and lawyer 
assignment  was pending in February, 1999 when he filled out the application.  Applicant stated in his June 20, 2001 statement to a Defense Investigative 
Service agent that he intended to file for bankruptcy in 2001.  He did not file until November, 2002.  Applicant was discharged in bankruptcy on February 1, 
2003.  The bankruptcy order listed all the debts, except the debt in subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR, which are the subject of this case. (Tr. 21, 22, 30; Gov't. 
Exhibit 1 at 7; Gov't Exhibit 3 at 2; Applicant Exhibits 3 at 1 and 2, and Exhibit 4 at 15 and 16)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant purchased a car for about $19,000 in 2001 and made payments monthly on that car.  After he filed his bankruptcy, the auto dealer called him and took 
the car back even though Applicant was current on his payments.  The dealer allowed him to buy a used car, valued at $15,000,  under a so-called "start over 
program".  At the time of the hearing he had not made his first payment, but he said he would.  Applicant is making his mortgage payments on time and the 
mortgage was not included in his bankruptcy. (Tr. 31, 32, 33, 41, 42; Gov't. Exhibit 4 at 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant compromised the one debt specified in subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR.  He does not remember when he did it, or the amount, but he knows it was 
compromised and he does not owe that debt anymore.  That is why he denied the allegation in subparagraph 1.b. (Tr. 52)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1., 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds 
from financially profitable criminal acts.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1. 2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3)</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The behavior was not recent.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) It was an isolated incident.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business<EM> </EM>downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government proved Applicant had financial problems.  He incurred a lot of debts during his marriage.  But Applicant explained why he could not pay them 
off, which was that he incurred them from 1980 onward with his now former wife, incurred them when their joint income was higher than his single income 
after 1998, and could not find a job which paid him enough money that with his military retirement he could pay them in a timely fashion.  However, he also 
bought a $19,000 new automobile when he had these debts to pay.  It appears from his testimony and the other evidence Applicant decided not to pay the old 
marital debts, and tried to start anew after his divorce.  He did buy a townhouse and the new car.  He does seem to have controlled his spending so he has not 
incurred new obligations since 1998 which he cannot handle.  Clearly, Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 3 above apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The next issue is whether Applicant mitigated these conditions.  The evidence is manifest that Applicant, after two unsuccessful attempts to file bankruptcy, did 
file bankruptcy in November, 2002, and was discharged in February, 2003.  Therefore, he used a lawful means to rid himself of these debts.  Mitigating 
Condition (MC) 6 would apply because Applicant initiated a good faith effort to resolve the debt through bankruptcy, a lawful procedure.  The debts were 
accumulated from 1980 to 1998, and he did not resolve the debts through bankruptcy until February, 2003.  That time period makes the debts recent, and MC 1 
cannot be applicable.  However, I give greater weight to the fact that the debts were finally resolved than that he took so long to do so.  He did attempt to file 
bankruptcy in 1998, but he seems to have had some problem with the attorney to whom he was referred and the bankruptcy counselor he hired.  Nonetheless, he 
should have pursued payment of these debts or bankruptcy promptly in 1998 or 1999.  Applicant did not complete his bankruptcy filings as he stated he would 
on two government forms, and these statements would be a concern except I find his actions to be caused more by a lack of focus on resolving the problem than 
a deliberate attempt to deceive or mislead the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The divorce and loss of full military pay and his spouse's income makes Applicant fall under MC 3.  The bankruptcy and the evidence Applicant does not incur 
new debts which he cannot pay from his current income supports the applicability of MC 4.  It could be argued that all his debts prior to 1998 are  isolated from 
his current situation, but I think it stretches the intention of MC 2, so I find that MC is not applicable here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After observing his demeanor at the hearing, and considering his testimony, I find his explanations of his financial problems to be credible.  His use of the 
bankruptcy statute, like his former spouse's use of the same statute to relieve herself of her share of the debts, is reasonable and legal, and within the 
requirements of Guideline F that he has "otherwise resolved his debts." (E2.A6.1.3.6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Evaluating the totality of the evidence, I conclude Applicant's financial problems have been mitigated and successfully and legally resolved.  Therefore, it 
would be clearly consistent with national security concerns to renew his security clearance. </SPAN></P>
