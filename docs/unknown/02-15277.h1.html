<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts accumulated during a tough period of unemployment, divorce and incapacitating medical issues.  While most of his 
old debts languished under extenuating circumstances related to his employment and personal issues, the debts have not since been mitigated through 
demonstrated efforts to either pay them down, consolidate them, or seek bankruptcy or Chapter 13 relief.  As such, Applicant fails to absolve himself of security 
risks associated with unresolved debts and unwillingness to address them through the variety of options available to him.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on May 19, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2003, and was scheduled for hearing on 
August 21, 2003.  A hearing was convened on August 21, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness 
(himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year old truck driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: Specifically, he is alleged to have incurred five delinquent debts, which 
exceed $28,000.00 in total  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of his listed debts without explanation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife at the time (W) accrued considerable credit card debts between 1997 and May 2000 (when they separated).  During this period both 
Applicant and W were employed (W as a member of a local city council  Applicant faced serious medical issues, beginning in August 2000, when he was 
diagnosed with a herniated disk in his neck that required corrective surgery (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 27).   His medical situation worsened in March 2001 when he suffered 
a massive heart attack that required the placement of two stints in his heart (<EM>see </EM>exs. D and E; R.T., at 26-27).  Later in 2001, he was diagnosed with colon 
cancer (<EM>see</EM> exs. F and G; R.T., at 27-28).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in May 2001, following his lay-off from work and ensuing initiation of divorce proceedings by his spouse (W), Applicant fell behind in a number of 
his accrued consumer debts.  These problems only compounded the adverse conditions affecting his physical and psychological state as the result of his medical 
set backs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's divorce settlement made provision for W's obtaining the family home and Applicant's award of the accumulated credit card debts.  Unable to 
discharge the debt with his available resources, Applicant consulted a bankruptcy attorney in May 2002.  This attorney counseled against his initiating 
bankruptcy, citing his lack of assets and corresponding judgment-proof status (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 43-44).  At the time, he didn't have the up-front $1,400.00 retainer 
fee to give the bankruptcy attorney and, in any event, elected not to pursue this course of action.  Instead, he made arrangements to pay off the $1,200.00 debt 
owed to the IRS (which he did) and attempted to reach payment arrangements with each of the remaining four consumer creditors (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at<EM> </EM>29, 33-34)<EM>. </EM> 
However, each of these creditors wanted payment in full and were unwilling to work out any payment arrangements with him (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 33-34).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each of Applicant's covered debts were, in turn charged off by the listed creditors.  None of these listed creditors have made any attempts over the past year to 
pursue debt collection against Applicant.   When he inquired of both his employer and the interviewing DSS agent what he should do about these debts, he was 
essentially advised by both to simply self-report them (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 45-46), which he did.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant currently lives week to week, is finished paying alimony to his ex-wife, and is current with his other debts (excluding the listed delinquent debts in 
the SOR).  He has made no payments on any of his remaining delinquent debts and has not explored either credit counseling or bankruptcy.  While he continues 
to experience deteriorating back problems, his cancer is in remission.  Most of his medical bills associated with his medical treatment are covered by medical 
insurance with his employer (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 38-39).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is praised by friends who know him as a caring and generous person who gives a considerable amount of his time to aid others with health problems 
and to act as an ombudsman volunteer for a local agency that dedicated to helping nursing care residents receive the medical care they require (<EM>see</EM> ex. B).  </SPAN></P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By reason of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (I) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant accrued considerable debt, much of it credit card-related, following his lay off and spouse initiated divorce proceedings in 2001.  These problems, 
coupled with the medical set backs he experienced in 2001, created financial strains, and ultimately his defaulting his debts.  Struggling to keep current with his 
other creditors over the two years that have elapsed since his lay-off and separation from his spouse, Applicant elected not to pursue either bankruptcy or credit 
counseling.  Creditors like the four listed consumer creditors (exclusive of his IRS debt which he paid) who charged off their debts were essentially ignored 
after initial efforts to work out repayment arrangement with them failed.  Altogether, Applicant and his former spouse accrued over $27,000.00 in listed 
delinquent debt.  These listed debts were written off by the creditors without any payments being contributed by Applicant since they became delinquent and are 
now likely barred from enforcement by pertinent statutes of limitation.  On the strength of the evidence presented, Government may invoke two Disqualifying 
Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>While Applicant's three listed credit card debts are understandable and extenuated, considering the financial predicament he found himself in following his lay-off, divorce, and compounding medical problems, his explanations for failing to later tend to these debts are not.  Once Applicant's creditors rebuffed 
Applicant's attempts to work out repayment arrangements with the resources he had at his disposal at the time, Applicant still had several options to turn to: 
debt consolidation, Chapter 13 relief, counseling, and even exploration of Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief.  Applicant chose none of these options (after consulting 
with a bankruptcy attorney), and continues to rely exclusively on pertinent statutes of limitations to forestall creditor enforcement and ultimately remove his old 
debts from credit reporting.</P> 
 
<P>Over time, our Appeal Board has shown general consistency in disallowing applicant claims to mitigation based on charge-offs and limitation bars on debts 
previously unpaid due to cited extenuating circumstances.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-17474 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-13653 (March 7, 2003); ISCR 
Case No. 01-12147 (January 21, 2003).   Security clearance decisions are, of course, never an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about a 
person's security eligibility based on the person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See Department of Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).   
Without any payment seasoning to rely on to advance his mitigation claims (save for his repayment of his IRS debt), he lacks the probative mitigation necessary 
to absolve him of the pressure and judgment risks associated with being in debt.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>So, while Applicant may take advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate his debt 
delinquencies, he may not fully invoke the mitigating provisions of MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors), absent more concerted efforts 
to address his old creditors than reliance on pertinent statutes of limitations, removal and anticipated removal of his listed debts from credit reports.</P> 
 
<P>To find insufficient mitigation of Applicant's accrued delinquent debts is not to minimize his work contributions or his personal expenditures of time in his 
community in the service of others requiring medical assistance. For these credits, Applicant merits acknowledgment and commendation.   Unfavorable 
conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through1.d of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing financial considerations.  Favorable 
conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 1.e of the SOR.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
