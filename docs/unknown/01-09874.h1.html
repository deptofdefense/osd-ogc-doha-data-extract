<P>Applicant mitigated concerns about excessive traffic fines in 1998 and 1999.  The Applicant also mitigated allegations of drug use up to 1994, and four drug 
related arrests between 1985 and 1991.  However, the Applicant falsified a 1998 questionnaire with regards to the same drug use and arrests.  Adverse inference 
is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 21, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 13, 2002, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government submitted its File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on June 28, 2002.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on July 9, 2002, and submitted a Response on August 6, 2002</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The Department Counsel 
did not object to the admissibility of the additional material submitted by the Applicant; consisting of a notarized statement by the Applicant, a letter from the 
Director, Human Resources and Security of his employer, and a resume.  The case was received by the undersigned on August 19, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 34 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Network Engineer, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the 
live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant admits that he used marijuana from approximately 1982 to 1994.  During this period, the Applicant used marijuana two to three times per 
week.  (Exhibit 6 at 2.)  The Applicant states he has not used marijuana since 1994 and expresses a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant admits using cocaine one time during the period 1982 to 1994.  The available record does not provide a specific date for this incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession on October 25, 1992.  The SOR alleges that the Applicant appeared in Municipal District Court on 
December 8, 1992, where the charges were stricken from the record.  The Applicant admits that, to his knowledge, the charges were stricken from the record.  
He does not recall going to court. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession on January 2, 1991.  The SOR alleges that the Applicant appeared in Municipal District Court on 
January 31, 1991, where the charges were stricken from the record.  The Applicant admits that, to his knowledge, the charges were stricken from the record.  He 
does not recall going to court. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession on June 26, 1989.  The SOR alleges that the Applicant appeared in Municipal District Court on July 
7, 1989, where the charges were stricken from the record.  The Applicant admits that, to his knowledge, the charges were stricken from the record.  He does not 
recall going to court.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession on July 17, 1985.  The Applicant states in his Answer that, to the best of his knowledge, the charge 
was dismissed.  He does not recall going to court.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 7, 1998, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had not used marijuana or other illegal drugs in the last 
seven years.  (Government Exhibit 5, question 27.)  This statement was a false answer to a relevant question concerning the Applicant's drug activity since he 
had in fact used marijuana from 1991 through 1994, and had been arrested for possession of marijuana in 1992.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the same questionnaire the Applicant also stated that he had never been charged or convicted of an drug related offenses.  In fact he had been arrested and 
charged with possession of marijuana on four occasions, 1985, 1989, 1991 and 1992.  The Applicant maintains that he misread this question to mean 
convictions, not charges.  The Applicant's explanation of the facts is not accepted.  He knew these events took place when he filled out the questionnaire in 
2000, and intentionally failed to tell the government about them. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was subsequently interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in March 2002.   In a sworn statement the Applicant 
sets forth his drug use.  He further states, "In regards to Item 24 on the EPSQ application 'Your Police Record' Alcohol drug offences.  I answered NONE 
because I did not recall having any subsequent inquiries show that I had been arrested for possesion (<EM>sic</EM>) but not convicted.  Therefore, because I was not 
convicted, the answer to offences was listed as none.  As for the arrests, I did not list them because they did not lead to anything and perhaps I should have."  
(Exhibit 6 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1998, the Applicant moved from State A to State B.  At the time he moved, he had an outstanding ticket for an insurance violation in State A.  When 
he arrived in State B, he found he could not get a driver's license because of the State A ticket.  The Applicant states that it took some time to gather the money 
to resolve the ticket, and he had to drive on his expired State A license to get to work.  During this period the Applicant was arrested for driving on an expired 
license in November 1998.  The Applicant finally resolved both situations and received a State B driver's license a year later, in November 1999.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The conduct set forth under subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., 1.e. and 1.f., above, will also be considered under this Paragraph.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As found above, the Applicant knowingly and willfully provided false material information to DoD during the clearance screening process.  In so doing the 
Applicant violated the felony criminal provisions of 18 USC 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Four of the Applicant's current supervisors supplied letters in support of the Applicant.  They are attached to his Answer to the SOR.  They include the Chief of 
Current Operations and Network Manager, and a Senior Network Engineer, who both work for the Armed Service the Applicant supports.  Two others are from 
the Executive Director (a retired Army Colonel) and the Assistant Executive Director for the Applicant's employer.  Each of these people find the Applicant to 
be a mature person, who has "clearly demonstrated a high level of responsibility" in the time he has worked for his employer.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The retired Colonel states:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I understand that there are issues with law enforcement in his youth and young adulthood, as well as problems with the information provided with his original 
security clearance paperwork.  I strongly believe that those are a result of his youthful immaturity at the time of these events, subsequent chagrin, the fact that 
this has been his first experience with DoD, and the first time applying for a security clearance.  I can say that he has been trustworthy in the over three years he 
has been associated with this enterprise.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case 
are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;<A HREF="01-09874.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including the violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of drug abuse, criminal conduct and falsification, that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the 
Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used illegal drugs and engaged in drug related 
criminal conduct (Guidelines H and E); that he engaged in non-drug related criminal conduct (Guideline E); and that he intentionally made false material 
statements to DoD, in violation of a felony criminal statute (Guidelines E and J).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  Under Paragraph 1 (Guideline H), the Applicant's drug use ended approximately eight years ago and there is no 
evidence of recurrence.  Paragraph 1 and its subparagraphs are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant showed extremely poor judgment in not resolving his tickets in State A before moving to State B.  He then compounded the problem by driving 
on an expired license and winding up with substantial fines to pay to two states.  However, it has been approximately three years since the incidents and there is 
no evidence of subsequent problems.  Subparagraphs 2.c., 2.d., 2.e., and 2.f. are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's drug related arrests took place more than ten years ago.  It is obvious that he has learned his lessons from these incidents.  The adverse 
inference of these arrests has been mitigated by time and subparagraph 3.a. is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  The Applicant knew, or should have known, 
that his drug use after December 1991 fell within the parameters of question 27, and that his criminal history fell within the parameters of question 24.<A HREF="01-09874.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The 
Applicant's explanations for failing to give correct answers to these questions have been examined and are found wanting.  They are not credible given his 
obvious intelligence and background.  Guidelines E and J are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The laudatory letters of recommendation from his superiors have been considered.  It is noted that the most recent conduct by the Applicant occurred in 1998, 
when he falsified his questionnaire.  However, it is also true that the Applicant did not reveal the truth until his March 2002 interview by the DSS.  Because he 
has not yet been completely forthcoming concerning how these falsifications took place, it cannot be said that he is eligible for a clearance at this time. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  As set forth above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
