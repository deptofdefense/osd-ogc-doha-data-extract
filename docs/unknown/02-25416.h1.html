<P>Applicant submitted a security clearance application on December 20, 2000 in which she intentionally failed to disclose financial delinquencies and civil court 
actions as required. Her knowing and willful certification of that form with the intentional falsifications contained therein constitutes an offense under 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security clearance concern caused by her personal conduct and the related criminal conduct in providing 
false information. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR 
that was received by DOHA on October 28, 2003, and denied all SOR allegations. Applicant requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on April 26, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on May 18, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 8, 2004. An amended notice 
of hearing was issued on June 3, 2004, changing the time and location of the hearing, although in the same city and on the same date as originally scheduled. 
The hearing was conducted as rescheduled.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government submitted thirteen documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-13. Applicant's attorney initially interposed but 
later withdrew objections to GE 3, 8, and 9. All government exhibits were then admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing and 
submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received 
on June 18, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On June 20, 2004, I received a document entitled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Government's Objection to Additional Matters Submitted by Applicant </EM>signed by Department Counsel with 
proof of service upon myself and Applicant's counsel. That document has been marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) A, and has been included in the record. 
Attached to App. Ex. A was a memorandum addressed to me signed by the same individual who authored AE 1, apparently the Applicant's supervisor. The 
attachment has been marked as AE 2. App. Ex. A contained a section entitled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Notice to Applicant </EM>requesting that any response to the Government's objection 
be received by June 28, 2004 or such later date as I may grant. No response or request for additional time to submit a response was received by me.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel objects to the admission of AE 2 on the basis that: 1) AE 2 was submitted after the close of the record in this cause without a request 
having been made to leave the record open for such purpose; 2) AE 2 contains Applicant's hearsay statements made after the close of the hearing; and 3) certain 
portions of AE2 are irrelevant, lack a foundation, contain speculation, and would have been subject to rebuttal evidence that would have been presented by the 
Government had they been presented during the course of the hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The hearing in this case was adjourned and the record closed at 4:00 p.m. on June 8, 2004. Prior to closing the record, I asked Applicant's attorney if he had any 
additional evidence to submit on behalf of Applicant, and he answered "No." (Tr. p. 32) Applicant did not request the record remain open for the submission of 
additional evidence, nor did he object to closing the record and adjourning the hearing. I did not receive any post-hearing submission from Applicant requesting 
the record be reopened or seeking leave to submit AE 2. Department Counsel's objection on the basis that AE 2 is an improper post-hearing submission is well-founded and sustained.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel is also correct in his objections to the hearsay statements of Applicant contained in AE 2, and that the speculative nature of the 
declarations of the author of AE 2 constitute inadmissible opinion evidence. Further, admission of AE 2 would deprive Department Counsel of the right to 
subject the author of AE 2 to cross-examination as mandated by Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.16. Department Counsel's objections based upon these rules 
of evidence are well-founded and sustained.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">AE 2 will not be admitted in evidence, made a part of the record, nor will it be considered by me in arriving at a decision  in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">          </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 48 years old, married, and has been employed in an administrative staff position by a defense contractor since November 1997. She was previously 
employed as a junior analyst by defense contractors from June 1997 to November 1997, and as an office automation assistant by the government from March 
1992 to August 1997. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">She was previously married in August 1976, and that marriage ended in divorce in February 1986. She was married a second time in August 1989, and that 
marriage ended in divorce in September 1992. She has two adult children, ages 22 and 21, who reside on their own. She has held a security clearance since 
1992, without any complaints ever being made alleging she has mishandled classified material. The memorandum she submitted from her apparent supervisor, 
AE 1, asserts "she is a stellar employee, who has demonstrated high loyalty, performance, trust, and dedication . . . " to her employer's mission. The author 
strongly recommends that Applicant's security clearance be reinstated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant signed and submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on December 20, 2000. The application included the following certification above her 
signature:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>CERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States 
Code).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR subparagraph 1.a. alleges Applicant falsified the SF 86 she submitted in December 2000 by failing to disclose she had filed for bankruptcy in April 1993 
in response to question 33: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy - In the last 7 years, have filed a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include 
Chapter 13)? </EM>Because more than seven years had elapsed between the filing of the bankruptcy and submission of the SF 86, Applicant was not required to 
disclose the bankruptcy filing.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SF 86, Applicant answered "No" to question 38: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days - In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent 
on any debt(s)? </EM>The SOR alleges seven debts that Applicant failed to list in response to this inquiry. The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b.(4) was placed for 
collection in September 1999, and the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b.(5) was a judgment entered against her in October 1999. Those accounts clearly 
should have been listed. The remaining accounts were either submitted for collection or had a judgment entered on the account less than 180 days prior to 
submission of the SF 86 or there is no indication when they became delinquent. No conclusion can be drawn as to whether they were required to be listed or 
not.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SF 86, Applicant also answered "No" to question 40: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Public Record Civil Court Actions - In the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record 
civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form? </EM>She had been a party to six civil court proceedings between January 1994 and October 2000 that were 
required to be disclosed in response to this question. The last court action in the case listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c.(7) occurred on June 11, 1993 according to 
the information contained in GE 11, and was outside the seven-year period being inquired into by question 40.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a signed and sworn statement on July 8, 2002 (GE 2) in which she explained the above omissions from the SF 86 as follows: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Omission of financial delinquencies (debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b.7.)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not recall omitting information about this debt. My handwritten answers to the questionnaire (EPSQ) was (sic) submitted to the Facility Security Officer 
(company name and name of FSO omitted). (She) entered data into an electronic system, I signed the printed hard copy on 20 Dec 00 without reading it. The 
hard copy I provided was not retained in my personnel folder only the electronic copy I signed and without handwritten answers I am not sure if the electronic 
response was entered incorrectly. I did not intentionally omit answering this question correctly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Omission of civil suits</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not recall omitting information about these civil suits. My handwritten answers to the questionnaire (EPSQ) was (sic) submitted to the Facility Security 
Officer (FSO) [company name and name of FSO omitted]. (She) entered data into an electronic system, I signed the printed hard copy on 20 Dec 00 without 
reading it. The hard copy I provided was not retained in my personnel folder only the electronic copy I signed and without handwritten answers I am not sure if 
the electronic response was entered incorrectly. I did not intentionally omit answering this question correctly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a different explanation for the omissions during the hearing. She testified that she stopped by her company's office to sign the SF 86 on 
December 20, 2000, and was told by the receptionist that a man was looking for her to deliver flowers. She looked out the office window at that time and 
observed that her automobile was in the process of be towed because she was late on her car payments. At that instant the FSO came running out of her office 
and told Applicant to sign the SF 86. Applicant did so without reading the document. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also testified the FSO prepared the SF 86 without any input from Applicant. She was vigorously cross-examined about how the SF 86 was prepared, 
and was adamant in her answers that she did not provide a handwritten form to be used in preparing the application, nor did she sit down with anyone and 
provide information as they entered it into a computer. However, she could not explain how personal information that would have only been known to her came 
to be inserted into the SF 86.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-25416.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant failed to disclose six civil court actions and at least two delinquent accounts in the SF 86 
she submitted in December 2000. She provided a statement attempting to explain the omissions that was emphatically contradicted by her incredible testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> applies in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's false answers and the contradictory explanations she has provided in an attempt to mitigate the omissions or relevant and material facts from the SF 
86 raise significant security concerns and severely undermine the ability to place trust and confidence in her at the present time. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline E and none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. The false answers she gave in the SF 86 constitute an offense under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 
1001. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged </EM>and DC 2:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply in this case. I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline J and none apply. Guideline J 
is decided against Applicant.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the case against her and satisfy her ultimate 
burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
