<P>Applicant was a substance abuser who began using marijuana while attending college in 1998.  She regularly used marijuana at least 400 times from September 
1998 to September 2002 and  has purchased small quantities of marijuana.  In May 1999, she used psilocybin mushrooms at least once.  In August 2001, 
Applicant stated she had last used marijuana the night before and intended to continue using marijuana indefinitely.  She stopped using illegal substances in 
September 2002 when she realized her marijuana use might preclude her from getting a security clearance.  Her two-year abstinence from drug use is 
insufficient to overcome the government's case under Guideline H.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On September 13, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision:  security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant answered the SOR on 
September 30, 2004.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on November 30, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the allegations.  
Applicant received the FORM on December 7, 2004.  She did not respond to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on January 31, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in the SOR except the allegation in &para; 1.e. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor and is seeking a security clearance.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She works as a financial analyst and has been with her current

curiosity she tried it.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">She purchased small quantities of marijuana for her own use on numerous occasions.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In May 1999 she</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">used psilocybin mushrooms at least once.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  She has not sold, cultivated, bartered, or transported marijuana.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On August 20, 2001, Applicant executed a signed, sworn statement to an authorized investigator of the Department of Defense admitting that she intended to 
continue using marijuana indefinitely.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>  </STRONG>She had used marijuana the day before she made her statement.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Between September 1998 and September 2002, Applicant regularly used marijuana at least 400 times.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  She used marijuana after April 2001 when she 
submitted her security clearance application and after August 2001 when she was questioned about her drug involvement by a Department of Defense 
investigator.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On September 5, 2002, Applicant was counseled at work about her recreational drug use.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> She decided to stop using any illegal drugs after the counseling

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure two of the Directive sets forth Adjudicative Guidelines that must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke 
an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline H - Drug Involvement:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An administrative judge need not view the Adjudicative Guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in Section E2.2, Adjudicative Process, of the Directive, are intended to assist 
the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person" concept, all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The adjudicative process factors which </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation 
sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated on trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship, the government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
are predictive in nature and must often address potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline H.  An applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the purchase, possession, and uses of 
marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms, is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The Directive clearly expresses the 
government's concern regarding drug involvement in &para; E2.A8.1.1.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's 
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information).  </EM>Paragraph  E2.A8.1.1.2.1 identifies and defines drugs (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds . . . 
(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens)</EM>.  Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance abuse falls 
within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (and drug abuse) and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (illegal drug possession, including . . . 
purchase, sale, or distribution).  Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately September 1998 to September 2002.  She 
also used psilocybin mushrooms at least once.  Applicant's illegal use and possession of both marijuana and mushrooms reflect adversely on her judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness and suggests that she cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant last used marijuana in September 2002.  She has made a concerted effort to remain drug free and she no longer associates with individuals using 
illegal substances.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Applicant has abstained from use of marijuana for at least two years or more.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply since her 
use is considered recent use.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant initially experimented with marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms out of curiosity at college in about 1998.  Upon 
graduation from college, Applicant was now a young adult and she regularly continued to use drugs, notwithstanding the illegal nature of her endeavor.  She 
exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature behavior, and continued her substance abuse of marijuana.  Applicant used 
marijuana at least 400 times from 1998 to 2002.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Moreover, Applicant's signed, sworn statement for a security clearance, dated August 20, 2001, indicated 
that  "[m]y most recent use was Sunday August 19</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> 2001 (yesterday)."<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Applicant further states "[m]y intentions are to continue my use of marijuana as I have 
described in my history."  Applicant needs to be applauded for being honest and forthright with regard to her drug use.  However, her marijuana use is too 
extensive and occurred over a lengthy period of time, at least four years.  Based on the facts and circumstances here, her claim to remain drug-free is not 
credible.  Applicant's two-year abstinence of drug use is too short a period of time to show she really intends to be drug-free.  She should want to be drug-free 
because it is illegal to use and purchase marijuana and mushrooms and not because she wants to get a security clearance.  I conclude this mitigating condition 
does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On September 5, 2002, Applicant was counseled about her drug use and how using marijuana could adversely affect her government's confidence in her as well 
as her employment.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  At that moment, she decided to stop using any illegal drugs.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence in the record to rebut her contention she has abstained 
since September 2002.  I conclude that this mitigating condition applies since she demonstrated an intent not to abuse drugs in the future.<A HREF="04-03779.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  But, Applicant 
needs to be drug-free for a longer period of time to show the seriousness of her intent, which is not just for the sake of her job but because of the illegality of 
drug use and possession.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sufficiency or insufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the 
length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case based on a 
careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence record within the parameters set by the Directive.  An administrative judge has discretion in deciding what 
period of time is sufficient to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation.  Here, two years since Applicant's last use is insufficient to demonstrate reform or 
rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under &para; E2.A8.1.3.2 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "[t]he drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event."  Applicant used psilocybin 
mushrooms, on at least one occasion in May 1999.  I conclude this mitigating condition applies to the use of mushrooms because this was an isolated incident 
and not repeated but not to the use of marijuana.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the security concerns arising from her use of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
