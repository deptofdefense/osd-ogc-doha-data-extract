<P>Applicant was convicted of felony larceny and involuntarily terminated from her job in retail sales in 1991 for helping a relative to shoplift merchandise from 
the store where Applicant worked. She deliberately did not disclose her employment termination or her felony offense on her security clearance application and 
falsely denied any involvement in the theft in a sworn statement provided to a government investigator. Criminal conduct and personal conduct concerns 
persist. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 12, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct, why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On March 31, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 
2004, and a hearing was scheduled for October 7, 2004. On September 27, 2004, Applicant requested a continuance as she had contacted legal counsel about 
representing her and she was scheduled to meet with this attorney late that afternoon. During a conference call of September 29, 2004, Applicant indicated the 
attorney had declined to represent her. She was granted a brief continuance to November 2004 to allow her time to possibly retain legal counsel and to prepare 
her case.</P> 
<P>Pursuant to notice of November 9, 2004, the hearing was held on November 30, 2004. Applicant was represented by her spouse, a recent law school graduate 
not engaged in the practice of law. Five government exhibits and four Applicant exhibits were admitted into the record and Applicant testified, as reflected in a 
transcript received on December 9, 2004.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was convicted of a 1991 felony larceny offense involving aiding another to shoplift and she had not complied 
with the terms of her sentence as of mid-April 2002. Applicant was also alleged to have violated Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code for failing to 
disclose her felony arrest and consequent employment termination on her security clearance application (SF 86) dated January 8, 2000.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The alleged deliberate 
falsifications were also cited under Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant was also alleged under Guideline E to have falsified a June 2002 sworn statement 
by denying any involvement in the theft and claiming no knowledge as to the basis for the charges filed against her by her former employer.</P> 
<P>In her Answer, Applicant admitted her felony arrest, but asserted she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft with the understanding her record would be "wiped 
clean in a couple of years." Applicant contended she had complied with her probation, completed her community service in early 1992 and paid court costs. 
Applicant denied any intentional falsification of her SF 86 or sworn statement. She attributed her failure to list her felony arrest to her understanding that she 
had pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor which had been removed from her record and her failure to disclose her employment termination to a "miscalculation of 
the 10 years time period." Applicant indicated in her Answer that she was standing by her statement to the agent that she had not been involved in any theft; 
however, she admitted in clarification at the hearing that she had lied to the agent. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the 
following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old senior system analyst employed since August 2000 as a contractor in the logistics support center at a military installation. She seeks a 
security clearance for her duties.</P> 
<P>Divorced from her second husband, Applicant supported herself and her two children by working as a data entry operator at night and as a part-time retail clerk 
at a local department store. While working the cash register in July 1991, Applicant knowingly aided a close personal relation in the shoplifting of clothing 
merchandise from the store.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Store security observed Applicant ring up for sale an item of clothing and then place additional items in this person's shopping bag 
without charging her for them. Applicant registered total sales of only $28.01. Store security detained the customer as she attempted to exit the store, and they 
recovered merchandise with a total retail value of $552.57.</P> 
<P>Applicant was fired from her employment with the store due to her role in the theft. She was also charged criminally with larceny of property over $250, a 
felony.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant pleaded not guilty, but in September 1991 she was found guilty by a judge, and sentenced to six months in the house of correction, suspended 
for two years. Applicant appealed her conviction. Found guilty after a jury trial in late October 1991, Applicant was sentenced to unsupervised probation and 
ordered to pay $530 in fines and costs, or in the alternative perform 90 hours of community service, by February 7, 1992. Applicant completed the community 
service sometime in 1992.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant dedicated her efforts to supporting her family thereafter, working as a computer operator and then computer specialist for a variety of companies, 
including a bank. In September 1999, she married her present spouse, and she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in May 2002.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> In August 2000, she began 
her present employment as a contractor at a military installation where she monitors an automated inventory management system.  Needing a security clearance 
for her duties, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on January 8, 2001. In knowing concealment of her 1991 larceny conviction, 
Applicant  responded "No" to question 20 concerning termination of employment under adverse circumstances within the past 10 years, and to question 21 
concerning whether she had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 18, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). Applicant intentionally misled the agent about her role 
in the 1991 theft of merchandise from her former employer. Applicant admitted she had been fired after being charged with larceny, but she falsely denied any 
involvement in the theft. As reflected in a signed, sworn statement provided to the agent, Applicant described her role as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the day of the incident, I was working as a cashier. The company security people stopped a lady at the door. They took her to a back room and questioned 
her. She told them that after she came through the checkout line, another person took her bag and put other things in her bag. The receipt indicated that she 
came through my checkout line. Apparently the security people did not believe her and charged me.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I was not involved in any theft. I rang up only the items that she came through the line with. I do not know why the security people would say that they saw me 
pass two items through the checker and only ring up one item. That is not true.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed that when she went to court, the judge did not have enough information to determine the truth, so called for a jury trial after which she was 
sentenced to either pay a fine or complete community service. Applicant denied any intentional falsification of her SF 86 when she failed to disclose the offense 
or employment termination, contending she had been charged with a misdemeanor that did not have to be listed and her employment with the department store 
was more than seven years before her application.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 29, 2002, Applicant was reinterviewed by the DSS about her involvement in the 1991 larceny. Applicant admitted she knew "a lady" was leaving 
the store without having paid for items, but she continued to deny any involvement in the theft of merchandise:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As I was working the cash register line that day, a lady approached the line with some merchandise in a basket. She presented the merchandise for payment by 
placing the items on the belt. I rang up all of the items she presented for payment and placed them in a bag. The total came to approximately $28.00. The lady 
was also carrying two additional bags of [store X] merchandise for which she had not paid, and which I did not ring up on the register. I allowed the lady to 
proceed through the line without paying for the additional two bags full of merchandise, knowing she was going to depart the store without paying for them. 
This was the only time that I ever allowed anyone to depart the store without paying for their merchandise. . . . This statement is the complete truth regarding 
this incident.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant remains unwilling to acknowledge her criminal culpability with respect to the larceny. At her November 30, 2004 hearing, Applicant testified initially 
a "lady" came to her line, and she rang in the items put in front of her. When the woman was caught, she had two other bags with about $500 in merchandise 
that had not been rung up as sales. Applicant claimed she was convicted on the basis she should have stopped "the lady." (Tr. 49) Although she later 
acknowledged she had a personal relationship with the woman, who she described as her sister, Applicant directly contradicted her August 2002 statement by 
denying any knowledge of the extra bags at the time her sister proceeded through her checkout ("She had her pocketbook, I know, and then the things that she 
put on the counter, that's what I saw. . . ." Tr. 56).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also denies any intentional falsification of her SF 86, attributing her omission of her employment termination and larceny conviction to her belief she 
did not have to report incidents that occurred more than seven years before. Given the inquiries are clear in requiring reporting of adverse employment 
information within the preceding ten years and any felony offenses no matter when they took place, Applicant's explanations are not persuasive. The record 
evidence does not support her claim of June 2002 that she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in 1991. Where she lied to the DSS agent about her involvement in 
the larceny, her claim of miscalculation as to the date of her firing from her retail sales job is not credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning the evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct. </STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. (&para; E2.A10.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG>. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. ( &para; E2.A5.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude 
the government established its case with respect to Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant was convicted in October 1991 
after a jury trial of felony larceny for her involvement in the theft of merchandise from her employer. Moreover, she committed felony violations of Title 18, 
Section 1001 of the United States Code by deliberately not listing this offense or her resultant employment termination on her SF 86 and by intentionally 
misleading the DSS about her role in the 1991 theft.<A HREF="02-30039.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under Guideline J, DC E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether  
the person was formally charged</EM>, and E2.A10.1.2.2. <EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>, apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence of any theft-related misconduct by Applicant since 1991 <EM>(see</EM> MC E2.A10.1.3.1. <EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>). Yet, this criminal 
conduct cannot be viewed as remote in time or isolated in nature, given her intentional misrepresentations of material facts to the government--behavior that 
raises personal conduct as well as criminal conduct concerns. Under Guideline E, DC E2.A5.1.2.2., <EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,</EM> and DC 
E2.A5.1.2.3. <EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination, </EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's pursuit of her college degree and work contributions reflect positively, but they are not enough to meet her burden of rehabilitation. There was no 
prompt good-faith effort at rectification, so MC E2.A5.1.3.3. (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being 
confronted with the facts</EM>) is not pertinent. When interviewed by the DSS agent in June 2002, Applicant falsely claimed she did not know why the store filed 
charges against her. In August 2002, she told the DSS she had allowed "the lady" to pass through her checkout line with two bags aware the items inside had 
not been paid for. At her hearing, Applicant admitted the other female involved was her "sister," but she denied any knowledge of the theft and claimed her 
sister had been given a bag to hold after she had proceeded through her checkout line. Significant doubts persist about Applicant's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness where she lacks remorse for her involvement in the theft, and where she continues to place her self-interest ahead of her obligation of candor to 
the government. SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 2.a., 2.b, and 2.c. are resolved against her. SOR subparagraph 1.b. is concluded for Applicant as the government 
did not prove that Applicant had not complied with the terms of her larceny sentence by April 2002.</SPAN></P>

January 8, 2001, and that her reference to the year that just passed was an inadvertent error. While DOHA erred in alleging falsification of a January 2000 SF 
86, there is no dispute over which form Applicant is alleged to have falsified. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Asked at her hearing whether she had a personal relationship with the woman who presented the clothing for purchase, Applicant responded she is her sister. 
(Tr. 54-55) The other suspect named in the police report was residing at the same address as Applicant. (Ex. 2) Yet, Applicant did not list this person as a 
relative on her SF 86. Applicant listed as siblings one sister of a different name and one brother. She may well not have included all of her siblings on her SF

or by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars and imprisonment in jail for not more than two years; or, if the value of the property stolen, other 
than a firearm as so defined, does not exceed two hundred and fifty dollars, shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for not more than one year or by a fine of 
not more than three hundred dollars; or, if the property was stolen from the conveyance of a common carrier or of a person carrying on an express business, 
shall be punished for the first offence by imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than two and one half years, or by a fine of not less than fifty nor 
more than six hundred dollars, or both, and for a subsequent offence, by imprisonment for not less than eighteen months nor more than two and one half years,

<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Applicant indicated on her SF 86 that her B.S. degree was awarded on May 14, 1999. (Ex. 1) However, she presented a copy of her degree showing the award
