<P>Applicant has a history of excessive drinking during his high school years and beyond (to at least June 2002) and  five alcohol-related offenses over a period of 
time that stretches from August 1997 to December 2000.  With no documented recurrence of abusive drinking since June 2002, Applicant mitigates the 
government's security concerns over his drinking excesses and alcohol-related offenses.  However, Applicant's concealment of four of his alcohol-related 
offenses in his executed security clearance application is not mitigated under any of the pertinent mitigation guidelines covered by Guideline E and raises 
continuing security concerns about Applicant's judgment and reliability.  Criminal implications of his omissions are mitigated under the separate mitigation 
conditions governed by Guideline J.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 26, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 21, 2005 and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on August 31, 2004, and is credited with receiving it on September 7, 2004.  Applicant did not respond to the  FORM within the 30 
days provided him.  The case was assigned to me on November 8, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (1) consumed alcohol with varying frequency, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 
1997 to at least June 2002, and (2) been arrested and charged on five separate occasions between August 1997 and December 2000 in connection with alcohol-related offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application  (SF-86) of June 2001 by omitting four of his alcohol-related 
arrests/charges.  Under Guideline J, the allegations made under Guideline E are incorporated by reference.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his excessive drinking and alcohol-related arrests/charges but denied falsifying his SF-86.  Applicant claimed a 
misunderstanding of the question covering alcohol-related offenses and forgetfulness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 25-year-old parts control specialist for a defense contractors  who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to 
by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a high school student Applicant drank excessively at party functions, sometimes to the point of intoxication, and continued his excessive drinking (off and 
on) for several years after graduating.  Between 1997 and 2000,  he was involved in five separate alcohol-related incidents.  Specifically, in August 1997 he was 
arrested for public intoxication, found guilty and fined $250.00.  He was arrested again for public intoxication in January 1998 (found guilty and fined $450.00) 
and in March 1999 (found guilty and fined $350.00).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2000, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DuI) and was ordered to pay a $1,000.00 bond and complete a pre-trial diversion 
program, which he did.  And in December 2000, he was charged with furnishing alcohol to a minor.  A warrant was issued for his arrest on this charge in 
January 2002.  It is unclear how Applicant responded to the issued warrant and the arrest charges.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To what extent Applicant continues to consume alcohol is not clear from the record.  In a June 2002 signed, sworn statement he gave to a DSS interviewer he 
assured he had talked to a counselor  to ensure he did not have a drinking problem, but provides no specifics as to the advice he received and what he has been 
doing to avoid recurrent incidents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an SF-86 he completed in June 2001, Applicant listed his 1998 public intoxication arrest when responding to question 24, but omitted his other alcohol-related offenses.  He attributes his omissions of his remaining four arrests to memory lapse on his omitted convictions and not understanding the question's 
coverage of charges as well as convictions (<EM>see</EM> Applicant's response). Question 24, however, is very clear about asking for information pertaining to arrests and 
charges. Applicant doesn't provide very much information as to how he could have both forgotten about two of his convictions and failed to list his 
arrests/charges in the remaining ones (some of which occurred more recently than the 1998 arrest).  Without more documentation in this administrative record 
to gauge Applicant's intentions, he cannot avert inferences that his omissions were knowing and wilful.  While Applicant did acknowledge his omitted offenses 
when interviewed by a DSS agent two years later, his signed, sworn statement indicated he did so only after being confronted with the incidents (<EM>see</EM> ex. 9). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a parts control specialist who drank to excess and committed five alcohol-related offenses between 1997 and 2000. His five offenses reflect alcohol 
abuse by Applicant and documented proof of his having a recurring problem with alcohol through at least June 2002.  Never diagnosed as an abusive drinker or 
alcohol dependent, Applicant, nonetheless, drank excessively while in social situations in high school and  as a young adult. There is no record, however, of his  
being involved in an alcohol-related offense since  December  2000, a period of almostg four years, or drinking excessively since June 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since June 2002, there are no clear indications of whether Applicant has stopped abusing alcohol. While he claims to have matured and stopped abusing 
alcohol, he provides no documentation from which to gauge assurances.   Still, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">potential abuse  predictions, generally, may not be based on supposition or 
suspicion.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 (April1998).  The Appeal Board has consistently held that an unfavorable 
credibility determination concerning an applicant is not a substitute for record evidence that the applicant used marijuana since his last recorded use, or based 
on his past use is likely to resume usage in the future.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (May 2004).   Based on the lack of any evidence he has abused alcohol 
since June 2002, Applicant may invoke </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>)<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and 
E2.A7.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  While Applicant's recurrent alcohol abuse over four plus years raises some questions over 
the strength of his avoidance assurances, it is not enough to prevent Applicant's successful mitigation of the issue. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's manifest avoidance of any further incidents of alcohol abuse or excessive drinking over the past two plus years represents important restorative 
action on his part and is encouraging.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related conduct must be made on the basis of a review of the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely the 
information developed with respect to his identified six characterized alcohol-related offenses.  In making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance 
eligibility, major emphasis must be accorded his most recent drinking history, his lack of any probative recurrent alcohol-related problems in or outside the 
work place over the past four plus years, and the adequacy of the time elapsed since his last abuse of alcohol (<EM>i.e., </EM>in June 2002) in the face of his corroborated 
commitment to avert alcohol-related incidents in the future. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All in all, Applicant's mitigation efforts to date reflect both increased understanding about alcohol abuse, sustained efforts to control his drinking and stated 
motivational reasons to avert abusive drinking in the future.  His avoidance of any additional alcohol-related incidents and abusive drinking over the past two 
plus years reflects considerable judgment restoration. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant makes a sufficient showing that he has gained the maturity to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses 
related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with such conduct.  Favorable conclusions warrant 
with respect to the alcohol-related allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline G. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns over Applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under Guideline E, too, as the result of his omissions of his four alcohol-related arrests in the SF-86 he completed in June 2001.  By omitting his alcohol-related arrests and convictions (in two of the cases), Applicant failed to furnish 
materially important background information about his alcohol history that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate his security 
clearance application.  Appellant's omissions are covered by Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: specifically, 
E2.A5.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's omissions are not shown to have been mitigated through prompt, good faith corrections and are not covered by any of the mitigating conditions of 
the Guidelines for criminal conduct.   Considering all of the evidence produced in this record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations 
covered by Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That none of Applicant's SF-86 omissions resulted in formal charges and adjudication against Applicant does not mean that the falsification issues may not be 
raised and considered anew in a clearance proceeding such as the present.  The Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the government can prove applicant 
engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).   Accordingly, two of the 
disqualifying conditions of the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal conduct may be invoked: E2.A10.1.2.1 <EM>(Criminal conduct regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged</EM>) and E2.A10.1.2.2 (A<EM> single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unlike Guideline E-covered omissions, Guideline J is designed to afford more recognition to an applicant's overall judgment and reliability history.  Still, an 
applicant must meet the requirements of at least some of the mitigation conditions if he is to successfully mitigate its related falsification parameters under 18 
U.S.C. Section 1001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's belated coming forward with his full disclosure of his four additional alcohol-related arrests and convictions in his DSS interview represented a 
positive shift in his attitude about withholding drug involvement information that he had long felt could imperil his job and clearance if disclosed.   From the 
record, his omissions appear to be isolated to his responses to a single security clearance application and involve incidents of his youth.  His corrections under 
the circumstances are enough to meet the mitigation requirement of evidenced clear rehabilitation to entitle him to apply MC E2.A10.3.6 (<EM>There is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) of the Guidelines for criminal conduct.  Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed 
record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 3.a of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
