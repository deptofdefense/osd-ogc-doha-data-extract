<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM>, dated January 1987, as amended (the Regulation); and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. (Directive).</P> 
 
<P>The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline H (drug involvement) why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it was clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the Department of Defense, and recommended a referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR on June 12, 2006, and elected to have the case decided on 
the written record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel mailed the government's file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant on June 28, 2006. He received it on July 5, 2006. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant neither objected to any of the FORM submissions, nor filed any additional evidence to be considered. The case 
was assigned to me on August 29, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following allegation:</P> 
 
<P>1.d. You were arrested on about August 13, 2005 in Dane County, Wisconsin, and charged with Resisting or Obstructing an Officer, a misdemeanor. You pled no contest on January 24, 2006, and 
were sentenced to five days in jail and required to pay court costs and fines.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Department Counsel also moved to replace the phrase, "subparagraph 1.d.," with the phrase,"subparagraph  1.b.," in subparagraph 2.c., and the phrase "subparagraph1.g." with the phrase 
"subparagraph 1.c.," in subparagraph 2.d. Applicant did not file a response. </P> 
 
<P>This motion is granted. As amended, subparagraphs 2.c. and 2.d., with the amended portions italicized, read as follows:</P> 
 
<P>2.c. That information as set forth in <EM>subparagraph 1.b </EM>above.</P> 
 
<P>2.d. You received treatment as a condition of your probation, as set forth in <EM>subparagraph 1.c.</EM>, above, from about October 2004 to at least about December 2004, at Gateway Recovery, Madison, 
Wisconsin, for a condition diagnosed as Cannabis Dependence.</P> 
 
<P>I interpret Applicant's failure to file a response to this motion as a denial of the amended allegations.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have incorporated Applicant's admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough review and consideration of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 23-year-old single man with a high school education who works for his employer as a data analyst. He has a history of criminal conduct. In August 2000, while in high school, he was 
cited for disorderly conduct after fighting with another student in the school library. Three years later, in February 2003, he was charged with possession of a controlled substance after the police, 
pursuant to a routine traffic stop, discovered marijuana in his glove compartment.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Immediately before the stop, he had been smoking marijuana while driving his automobile. He was ultimately 
fined $159.00.</P> 
 
<P>Approximately five months later, Applicant, who was then 20 years old, began dating a 16-year-old girl. She later accused him of sexual assault, prompting the police to arrest and charge him with 
felony sexual assault. Subsequently, he pled guilty to the lesser offense of fourth degree sexual assault. The court then place him on probation for two years, and ordered him to attend counseling.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
He began counseling in July 2004, and completed it, as ordered.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In August 2005, Applicant was charged with resisting or obstructing a police officer.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In April 2006, he pled no contest, and was fined $88.00.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's arrest history corresponds with a history of drug use. By age 16, he had begun sporadically using marijuana. By age 18, he was using it daily. While attending counseling related to the 
sexual assault offense, Applicant was diagnosed with cannabis dependence. As of March 2005, he was no longer using marijuana.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> It is unclear from the record exactly when he stopped.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's drug abuse also included the use of cocaine and ecstasy. His cocaine use ranged from February 2003 through July 2003. For one month during this period, he used it daily.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His use of 
ecstasy was more sporadic. By 2003, he had used it approximately six times. He has used neither drug since 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation apply to ADP trustworthiness determinations. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive 
before any final unfavorable determination may be made.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible  rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in 
conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist in reaching fair and impartial common sense 
decisions.</P> 
 
<P>The standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, "based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the 
person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions 
and mitigating conditions under each guideline.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>The following adjudicative guidelines are raised:</P> 
 
<P>Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions pertaining to these guidelines that could raise a security or trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security or trustworthiness concerns, 
are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of national security (and sensitive information) is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be reached by applying the standard that the determination of 
an applicant's eligibility for occupying a public trust position is "clearly consistent with the national interest."<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, 
logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.</P> 
 
<P>The government is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have been controverted.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
trustworthiness determination.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> These 
same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's history of criminal conduct triggers the applicability of DC 1<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>and DC 2.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> I have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. His criminal activities span a 
period of six years, and his most recent offense was less than two years ago. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's history of heavy marijuana use, in tandem with his experimentation with cocaine and ecstasy, trigger the applicability of DC 1<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and DC 2.<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Although he told a security clearance 
investigator that he was diagnosed with cannabis dependence, the record contains no evidence of the credentials of the person who diagnosed him, nor any records detailing his treatment history. 
Therefore, DC 3<A HREF="06-07674.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> does not apply.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Although Applicant asserted in his Affidavit that he is no longer abusing marijuana, he did not specify when he stopped. 
Also, his rationale for stopping was glib and equivocal. Because of the extent and recency of his past marijuana abuse, it is too soon to conclude that it no longer poses a security concern. Applicant 
has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Nearly every year of Applicant's life since age 16 has been characterized by criminal conduct and drug involvement. His most recent arrest in 2005 demonstrates that he has neither matured, nor 
rehabilitated himself. Consequently, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress remains unacceptably high. Eligibility is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I conclude Applicant is not eligible to occupy a public trust position. Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 
of the Directive, are:</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position. Eligibility is denied.</P>
