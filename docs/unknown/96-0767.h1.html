<P><U><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On November 26, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to -----------------    (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 20, 1996. The case was received
by the undersigned on January 21, 1997, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on February 4, 1997.
A hearing was held on April 2, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><FONT FACE="Times">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</CENTER>
</U></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"></U>At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons by adding
an allegation that applicant deliberately provided false, material information to the Government in
response to two questions on a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ). Applicant did not object to
Department Counsel's motion. After considering the authority for granting such a motion (Paragraph
17, Page 3-3 of the Directive) and the evidence presented at the hearing, Department Counsel's
motion was granted in part and denied in part (TR at 48-50).  Pursuant to the ruling on the motion,
the SOR was amended by adding the following allegation:</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>Criterion E:  Personal Conduct</CENTER>
</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	1. On a NAQ signed by you on July 7, 1992, you answered "no" to question 20.a. which
asked: "Have you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or cocaine),
depressant (to include Quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to
include marijuana or hashish), or any mind-altering substance (to include glue or paint), even one
time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician?" when in fact, as you
well knew, you had used cannabis as alleged in paragraph 3.a. of the SOR.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On April 5, 1997, applicant filed a written response to this allegation. This response was
marked as Exhibit C and admitted into evidence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><U></U>	Applicant is a forty year old divorced man. He is employed as a systems engineer by a
defense contractor,  and has held a DOD security clearance since at least 1992.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Criteria D and J</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant engaged in voyeuristic activities with varying frequency, at times daily, from
approximately 1980 through May 1996. He engaged in this activity in his immediate neighborhood
"thinking that (he) wasn't hurting anyone because no one would know" (G-2). As a result of this
activity, applicant was stopped and questioned by the local police department on four or five
occasions (TR at 29, 46).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On June 6, 1988, the police went to applicant's home and spoke with him after someone in
the neighborhood filed a complaint following one of applicant's voyeuristic adventures. Applicant
testified that, contrary to SOR Allegation 1.b., he was not arrested on this occasion, but rather the
police talked to him about his "situation" and suggested that he do something to "solve the problem"
(TR at 47). Apparently, at least in part because of this conversation, applicant sought treatment for
voyeurism from------. However, because he did not feel he was receiving any benefit from this
treatment,  he discontinued it (TR at 28-29).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On December 20, 1994, applicant was arrested for Criminal Trespass after he jumped over
a fence into his neighbor's backyard "early one morning to see what (he) could see" (G-2). Although
he initially told the police they had the wrong man, he eventually admitted to them that he was the
individual in the neighbor's yard. Applicant testified that he pleaded guilty to the charge to get the
process over with so he could get into a treatment program. As a result of his guilty plea, he was
placed on probation for three years and ordered to get counseling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Within a week of his arrest, he contacted-------------  (Counselor 1). He saw Counselor 1 on
two occasions in January 1995. He stopped seeing Counselor 1 after the court instructed him to get
treatment from --------------  (Counselor 2). Applicant had his first appointment with Counselor 2 on
February 17, 1995. A March 27, 1997 letter from Counselor 2 was admitted in evidence and in
pertinent part is as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	"I am documenting (applicant's) completion of treatment in the Sex Offender
Program --------(Applicant) began treatment with an intake interview on February 17,
1995. Since intake he has attended nine individual and thirty-nine group therapy
sessions. (Applicant's) attendance and attitude towards treatment have been good. 
(Applicant) did suffer a relapse in 1996. Since his relapse he has worked hard on
developing additional skills in identifying and preventing his relapse process. He has
completed assignments in victim empathy, clarification/apology statements, and
identifying contributors and interventions to prevent any future relapses. Since
making a geographical move, (applicant) has developed additional interests, and
discontinued his substance abuse. He remained gainfully employed during his
treatment and has reported no relapses or other legal referrals since his relapse last
year. (Applicant) completed treatment today. His aftercare plans include locating and
attending local support group meetings." (Exhibit A)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	From the time of his December 1994 arrest to November or December 1995, applicant did
not engage in voyeurism. However, following what applicant described as "triggering events,"<A HREF="96-0767.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> he
resumed this activity and engaged in it approximately twenty-five times through May 1996. He
stopped sometime in May 1996 because he "got caught by one or more" of the residents of his
apartment (G-2). Although he was not arrested on this occasion, he was asked to move out of his
apartment, which he did in June 1996. When the court was notified of applicant's "relapse," his
court-ordered counseling period was extended beyond the original October 1996 completion date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant testified that as a result of his treatment with Counselor 2, he feels like he has the
training and tools to recognize the danger signs that lead to his inappropriate behavior. He believes
that this training will enable him to control his deviant behavior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Criterion H</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times daily, from approximately 1976
to March or April 1996. He purchased marijuana with varying frequency, at times weekly, from
approximately 1979 to March or April 1996.  Applicant used hash, speed and cocaine a few times
in the 1970s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant testified that his drug usage has "completely gone away."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Criterion E</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant intentionally provided false, material information to the Government when he
responded "no" to question 20.a. on the NAQ he executed on July 7, 1992 (G-1). He did so because
he was concerned that if he revealed his use of illegal drugs it might affect his chances of obtaining
a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A performance appraisal covering the period January 1 through December 31, 1996 was
admitted in evidence (Exhibit B). This appraisal establishes that in 1996 applicant performed well
at his job.</FONT></P>

</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT FACE="Times">	In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that
reasonably suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information. If the
Government meets its burden, it has established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT>case. Once the Government
establishes a <FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT>case, the burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation,
extenuation, mitigation or reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the Government's
<FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT>case, he or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the
Directive's requirement that a security clearance be granted only upon a finding that to do so is
clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criteria D and J</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Government established a <FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case under Criteria D and J. The evidence
establishes that applicant engaged in voyeuristic activity from approximately 1980 through May
1996, and that this conduct resulted in an arrest for Criminal Trespass in 1994. Applicant's sexually
perverted and criminal conduct reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness,
and strongly suggests that he can not be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant failed to establish that he has reformed. Although his December 1994 arrest and
subsequent conviction forced him into the much needed treatment with Counselor 2, and that as a
result of this treatment applicant believes he can now control his deviant behavior, it is too soon to
safely conclude that applicant can, in fact, control this sexually deviant and criminal conduct. In
view of (1) his approximately fifteen years of sexually deviant and criminal conduct, (2) his 
demonstrated inability to control this conduct, particularly from late 1995 to early 1996 when he had
already been in treatment for at least eight months, and (3) the lack of a favorable prognosis from
Counselor 2, I cannot conclude at this time that applicant is unlikely to engage in voyeuristic activity
and/or criminal conduct in the future. For this reason, Criteria D and J are found against applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Criterion H</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The Government established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case</FONT> under Criterion H.  The evidence establishes
that applicant (1) used marijuana with varying frequency, at times daily, from approximately 1976
to at least March or April 1996, (2) purchased marijuana with varying frequency, at times weekly,
from approximately 1979 to March or April 1996, and (3) used hash, speed and cocaine in the 1970s.
This abuse of illegal drugs, particularly after he received a DOD security clearance in 1992, reflects
adversely on applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and reasonably suggests that he
cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information for at least two reasons:</P>

<P>	First, individuals granted access to classified information are responsible for safeguarding
it twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, on and off the job. An applicant who uses illegal
drugs such as marijuana and cocaine cannot be relied upon to meet his or her security responsibilities
because the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information through neglect or
inattention while "high" on them is too great. Second, applicant used marijuana for many years with
full knowledge that each time he used it he was breaking the law. This suggests that applicant may
be unwilling to abide by security regulations if he finds them in conflict with his personal wishes or
desires.</P>

<P>	Applicant failed to establish that he has reformed. In view of his earlier intentional
falsification of material facts concerning his drug use, his uncorroborated testimony that he has
reformed cannot be considered credible evidence that he no longer uses marijuana or that he will not
use it in the future. For this reason, Criterion H is found against applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion E</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Government established a <FONT FACE="Times">prima facie</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> case under Criterion E. The evidence establishes
that applicant intentionally provided false, material information to the Government when he denied
any illegal drug use in response to question 20.a. on the NAQ he executed on July 7, 1992. This
dishonest conduct reflects adversely on applicant's judgment and reliability, and strongly suggests
that he lacks the </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">trustworthiness required of individuals with access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant failed to rebut the Government's </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. Other than one performance
appraisal, applicant failed to offer </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">any independent evidence </FONT>indicating that he is now a trustworthy
individual. In view of the recency and seriousness of applicant's falsification, the lack of such
evidence precludes a finding that he is now sufficiently trustworthy to be relied upon to be truthful
with the Government. For this reason, Criterion E is found against applicant.</P>
