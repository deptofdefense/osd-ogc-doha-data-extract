<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 25, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 8, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on May 2, 2002, and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on May 16, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on June 13, 2002, at which the Government presented four documentary exhibits, and called one witness.  Testimony was taken from the 
Applicant, who also submitted three exhibits.  The transcript was received on June 21, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 40, single and has a Bachelor's degree in Journalism.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a technical writer, and she seeks to obtain a 
DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is 
financially overextended.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  1.a.  This allegation concerns a $301 debt for an apartment security deposit.  The Applicant  does not believe she should owe this money.  The debt has not 
been paid and the Applicant has no present intention of paying it.  (Transcript at 19-21.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  This allegation concerns a bank credit card debt for $561.  A credit report of the Applicant dated March 1, 2002, shows that the Applicant has two credit 
card accounts with this particular bank.  (Applicant's Exhibit A.)  One account is current and the second shows as a bad debt.  The Applicant is uncertain, but 
she believes that this debt was paid off when she consolidated several credit cards.  (Transcript at 21-22.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant admits owing this credit card debt of $6,642.  No payments have been made on this debt.  (Transcript at 23.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  This subparagraph concerns a department store credit card debt in the amount of $1,518.  No payments have been made on this debt.  (Transcript at 24.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant admits owing this credit card debt in the amount of $9,289.  No payments have been made on this debt.  (Transcript at 24.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  This allegation concerns a debt to a dentist for $172.  The Applicant refuses to pay this debt because she alleges the dentist performed substandard work.  
(Transcript at 24-25.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g.  The Applicant admits owing this $99 debt to a medical group.  She testified that she has tried to contact the medical group to arrange payment but can 
never talk to a competent person.  No payments have been made on this debt.  (Transcript at 25.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h.  The Applicant makes enough money to cover her current expenses and have approximately $450-500 left over every month.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated at the hearing that she felt she had resolved this situation because the majority of the debts listed on the SOR were no longer on her credit 
report dated February 28, 2002.  (Applicant's Exhibit B, Transcript at 38-39.)  The Applicant's credit report dated March 1, 2002, showed the creditors in 
subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.g., as well as two additional creditors.  (Applicant's Exhibit A.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that she felt her first responsibility was to her son and that attempting to pay off the large debts would affect her ability to do that.  The 
Applicant also stated that her ex-boyfriend helped run up these debts and then ran out on her.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has made 
false statements during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 25, 2000, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which she stated that she had one account which had been over 180 days 
delinquent in the last seven years.  (Government Exhibit 1, Question 38.)  In the same application, the Applicant also stated that she was currently 90 days 
delinquent on only one account.  (Government Exhibit 1, Question 39.)  These were false answers to relevant questions concerning the Applicant's debt 
situation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant gave several conflicting reasons for answering the questions that way.  She first maintained that she did not have a copy of her credit report with 
her, and gave information on the debts she knew about.  The Applicant next stated that she felt several of the debts had been removed from her credit report 
and, therefore, she did not have to report them.  (Transcript at 40-43.)  The Applicant then testified that in filling out questionnaires for other jobs, "[Every] 
time I've filled something out, it hasn't been, you know, exact details.  I thought as long as I brought it up, yes, the fact that I do have debts, that that was 
sufficient."  (Transcript at 44.)  Finally, she stated that she felt it would be worse to put something on the forms that was wrong.  (Transcript at 45.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was subsequently interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in October 2000.  In a sworn statement (Government 
Exhibit 2 at 1), the Applicant stated that she "believed" three creditor accounts on her credit report (Government Exhibit 4) were actually one account.  In 
actuality only two of the accounts were the same account.  On page 3 of the sworn statement she says, "There are no current problems with my credit."  
(Government Exhibit 2 at 3.)  Records indicate that the Applicant is able to maintain payments on her current debt.  (Applicant's Exhibits A and B.)  In my 
opinion, the statements by the Applicant referred to her ability to her current debt situation and not her past due bills.  Subparagraph 2.b. is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have debt problems or be involved in acts of falsification that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has debt problems (Guideline F); and that she made 
false material statements to DoD (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against her, except in part.  Regarding Paragraph 2 (Guideline E):  Subparagraph 2.b. is found for the Applicant as I have determined that 
there was no willful falsification as alleged in this subparagraph.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a serious and long-standing debt problem which she either cannot, or will not, resolve.  She has not made a good faith effort to resolve her 
debts, and her reliance on the debts "dropping off" of her credit report is misplaced.  She has excess money every month, but has not even taken the time to 
resolve the smallest of the alleged debts, one for $99.  Her desire to do the best for her child is laudatory, but her actions, or lack thereof, do not demonstrate the 
good judgment required of clearance holders.  Paragraph 1 and its subparagraphs are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  I have closely examined the various reasons the 
Applicant gave for not giving the Government a fuller accounting of her debt situation in 2000 and find them wanting.  It is obvious that the Applicant knew, or 
should have known, that her answers were seriously incomplete.  There is a point where incompleteness becomes falsification.  That point has been reached 
here.  Subparagraph 2.a. and Paragraph 2 are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons. </SPAN></P>
