<P>Applicant, who was born, educated, and married in the People's Republic of China (PRC),</P> 
<P>became a U.S. citizen in 2000 and is employed as a systems engineer by a government contractor.  She is responsible for managing access to a database 
containing personal and medical information about military and civilian patients.  Applicant's parents, brother, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of 
the PRC.  In 1994, 1995, and 1996, when working for another employer, she was sent to the PRC to solicit information technology business for the employer.  
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising from having relatives who are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant's eligibility for assignment to 
a sensitive position is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 12, 2001, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant 
the application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM>, (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (the "Regulation"), and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the 
"Directive").  On July 28, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised 
under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 15, 2005.  She elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on November 25, 2005.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on February 1, 2006.  The government 
introduced two exhibits (Ex.), identified as Ex. 1 and 2, and four documents for administrative notice, identified as I through IV.  Applicant presented two 
exhibits, identified as Ex. A and B, and the testimony of one witness.  Additionally, Applicant testified on her own behalf.  The parties' exhibits and documents 
for administrative notice were admitted to the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript on February 8, 2006.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under the Foreign Influence Guideline of Appendix 8 of DoD 5200.2-R..  In her answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted the four allegations and noted mitigating conditions.  Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 48 years old and employed as a systems engineer by a defense contractor.  (Ex. 1, at 1-2.)  She administers a graphical user interface on a data base 
system that provides access to the sensitive personal and medical information of military and civilian patients.  (Tr. 37-38.)  None of the information in the 
system Applicant administers is classified, and there is no proprietary government software on the system.  (Tr. 33; 39.)  The interface software is a dual-use 
technology which has multiple uses and could be configured for military systems.  (Tr. 38.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and received an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering in the PRC.  (Tr. 51.)  In 1985 
Applicant and her husband, who was also born and raised in the PRC, were married in the PRC.  (Ex. 1.)  In 1989, the couple immigrated to the U.S. and earned 
advanced degrees.  (Answer to SOR at 1-2.)  Applicant's husband is also a data base administrator.  (Tr. 54-55.)  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2000, and 
her husband became a U.S. citizen in 1998.  They are the parents of one child, born in 1992, who is a U.S. citizen.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1994 to 1999, Applicant was employed as a senior systems engineer by a private telecommunications company.  (Ex. 1.)  The Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) of the company asked Applicant to travel to the PRC with him in 1994 as a technical representative and translator.  He described the purpose of the trip 
as "fostering international trade and assisting certain Chinese ministries in the area of telecommunications infrastructures."  (Ex. A at 1.)  After the CEO 
established business relationships with Chinese-owned companies, he assigned Applicant to travel back to the PRC as his representative in 1995 and 1996 "to 
investigate in person the technical capabilities of several companies for the purpose of determining whether we really wanted to further develop a business 
relationship with any of them."  (Tr. 47-50; Ex. A at 1.)  No business relationships with PRC companies grew out of Applicant's assignment.  (Tr. 49.)  When 
she was in the PRC on business in 1994, 1995, and 1996, Applicant took the opportunity to visit her parents and her brother.  (Answer to SOR at 3.)  She has 
not traveled to the PRC for pleasure or on business since 1996.  (Tr. 30.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and father are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant's father is 80 years old and a retired office manager. He was not employed by 
the Chinese government.  Applicant's mother is 74 years old and a retired telecommunication company manager. Because utilities such as telecommunications 
were state-owned, Applicant's mother was an employee of the PRC government.  (Answer to SOR at 1; Tr. 45.)  The parents live with Applicant's 38-year-old 
brother, who is also a citizen and resident of the PRC.  (Ex. 2.)  Until November 2005, Applicant's brother was employed by a financial securities research 
group in the PRC.  He is currently unemployed.  (Answer to SOR at 2; Tr. 45-46.)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  The father-in-law is retired and a former construction manager.  Applicant's 
mother-in-law is retired from work in the clothing manufacturing business.  Neither of Applicant's in-laws worked for the Chinese government.  The parents 
receive medical and retirement benefits from the government of the PRC.  (Answer to SOR, at 2; Tr. 46-47.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has close relationships with her father, mother, and brother.  She speaks often with her family members by telephone.<A HREF="04-12331.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  (Ex. 2.)  She speaks with her 
mother-in-law and father-in-law once a year by telephone.  Applicant's contacts with her family members in the PRC focus on health, retirement, and family 
matters. (Answer to SOR at 2-3; Ex. 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's line manager appeared as a witness at the hearing and testified to Applicant's professionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability.  (Tr. 32-33.)  He also 
supplied a letter of character reference for Applicant in which he identified her as "an exceptional performer, whose presence is highly valued." (Ex. B at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I take administrative notice that the PRC is an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), whose military and political goals are 
antithetical to the U.S.  China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), Country Reports on Human Rights Practices- 2004, U.S. Department of State: 
Government document IV for administrative notice)   In pursuit of its military goals, the PRC has stolen design information on the United States' most 
advanced thermonuclear weapons.  The PRC has used a variety of approaches to acquire military technology, including exploiting dual use products and 
services for military advantage in unforeseen ways.  Additionally, the PRC tries to identify ethnic Chinese in the U.S. who have access to sensitive information 
and sometimes to enlist their cooperation in information transfers.  (U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns With the People's Republic of 
China, Vol I, Report of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns With the People's Republic of China,  May 25,

Executive Order 12968, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information 
shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of 
character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and 
willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R.  "The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning 
the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."  DoD 5200.2-R, &para; C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation, are (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the 
available, reliable information about the person. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be 
made.  DoD 5200.2-R, &para; C8.2.1.  Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify 
the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to 
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to 
classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant's mother, father, brother, and mother-in-law and father-in-law  are citizens and residents of the PRC (&para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 
and 1.c.); and that Applicant traveled to the PRC in at least 1994, 1995, and 1996. (&para; 1.d.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under the Foreign Influence 
Guideline of Appendix 8 of DoD 5200.2-R.  The Regulation provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to 
whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>.</EM>"  The Regulation does not define the 
phrase "immediate family member," but the Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1, defines the phrase to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and 
sisters.  Applicant's mother, father, and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Additionally, Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to her 
mother-in-law and father-in-law, who are also citizens and residents of the PRC.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the security concerns related to Applicant's family members in the PRC, a concern arises over Applicant's travel to the PRC and her contacts, in 
1994, 1995, and 1996, on behalf of her employer, with PRC telecommunications companies.  These contacts, which occurred while Applicant was a citizen of 
the PRC, raise a concern under a disqualifying condition identified in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, Foreign Influence, as "conduct which may make an 
individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government."  This security concern can be mitigated under the Foreign Influence 
Guideline of the Regulation if an individual can demonstrate that "contacts with foreign citizens are the result of official U.S. Government business."  The 
record does not support a conclusion that Applicant's contacts with telecommunications officials in the PRC were the result of official U.S. Government 
business.  Accordingly, the security concern raised by Applicant's conduct is not mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The security concerns raised by Applicant's relatives who are citizens and  residents of the PRC may be mitigated where it is determined that "the immediate 
family member(s) . . .or associate(s) would not constitute an unacceptable security risk."  DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, Foreign Influence.  The Regulation does 
not provide a definition or explanation for the phrase, "unacceptable security risk."  However, in similar circumstances, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. of the Directive provides 
that it may be mitigating where the relatives in question "are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother, father, brother, mother-in-law and father-in-law are not "agents of a foreign power."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).  They are not employees 
of the PRC government, or otherwise associated with a "foreign power."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the character of the government of the relevant 
foreign country.  The PRC is an  authoritarian state controlled by the communist party and aggressive in its desire to acquire, through illegal methods, advanced 
U.S. military and technological information.  To carry out this aggressive policy, the PRC often seeks to identify ethnic Chinese living in the U.S. who have 
access to sensitive information and to elicit their cooperation in the illegal transfer of this technology or information to the PRC.  Individuals with family 
members in the PRC are vulnerable and can be targeted and pressured</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> to act adversely to the interests of the United States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is also important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives.  Applicant's father and mother are elderly and retired. Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are also elderly and retired. They rely on the government for retirement income and medical care.  Under these circumstances, 
Applicant's parents and parent-in-law are vulnerable to governmental pressure or duress.  Additionally, Applicant's brother recently lost his job and is 
unemployed, making him vulnerable to pressure and duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Another factor that can mitigate security concerns identified in the Foreign Influence Guideline is a finding that an applicant's contact and correspondence with 
foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.  Applicant's frequent contacts with her family members in the PRC are based on strong familial ties of affection and 
obligation.  They are not casual and infrequent , and they, in turn, raise the issue of  Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through 
her ties with her relatives.  In her affidavit, Applicant acknowledged strong familial and emotional ties to her mother, father, and brother. She is in frequent 
communication with them.  Through her husband, she has close familial ties to her mother-in-law and father-in-law as well.  These ties of affection and 
obligation could be exploited by an aggressive government seeking sensitive information or technologies.  I conclude that even though Applicant's loyalty, 
patriotism, and  allegiance to the U.S. are not in question in this proceeding, it is possible for a foreign power to exploit her familial loyalties in a way that 
would force her to chose between loyalty to the relatives in question and the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I balanced all the factual circumstances and applied them to the adjudicative criteria established in the Regulation in light of the whole person concept.  I 
considered the likelihood that the PRC government or a foreign power in that country would exploit Applicant's relatives.  I have also considered the relatives' 
vulnerability to pressure, coercion, or duress, and Applicant's ties of affection or obligation to them and to the United States.  I conclude the mitigating 
conditions set out in the Regulation do not apply to the facts of Applicant's cas</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">e.</SPAN></P>
