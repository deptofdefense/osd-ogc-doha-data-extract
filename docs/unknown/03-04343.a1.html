  Given the Administrative Judge's unchallenged findings about Applicant's family ties and financial interests in Lebanon, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude security concerns were raised under Guideline B that shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  Applicant's  disagreements with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence are not sufficient to demonstrate error by the Judge.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 14, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated June 20, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issue: whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by the Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence) allegations had not been mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations had not been 
mitigated.</SPAN>  Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Administrative Judge to conclude that he had 
rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations.  For the reasons that follow, the Board 
concludes Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge made unchallenged findings that: (1) Applicant has a large family in Lebanon, including his parents, two brothers, two sisters and 
other extended family members that he remains close to, (2) Applicant provides financial support to his parents in Lebanon on a regular basis, and (3) Applicant 
has done favors for one of his brothers, resulting in dishonest conduct when Applicant agreed to accept title to real estate owned by his brother, for the sole 
purpose of avoiding legal process against his brother.<A HREF="03-04343.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Given those findings, the Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with his immediate family members 
raised security concerns under Guideline B and that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 1<A HREF="03-04343.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> applied.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-22606 (June 30, 2003) at p. 
6.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.</P> 
<P>Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge gave insufficient weight to evidence that: (1) Applicant's relatives in Lebanon were not agents of the 
Lebanese government, (2) Applicant's contacts were exclusively familial, and devoid of political context, (3) Applicant is a loyal American citizen, with strong 
family and financial ties to the United States, and (4) Applicant's ties to Lebanese citizens, including many of his relatives, are casual and infrequent, and would 
not subject him to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  The Board interprets Applicant's contentions as raising the specific issues of whether the Judge (1) erred 
in not applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="03-04343.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 3,<A HREF="03-04343.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> (2) failed to consider mitigating evidence, and (3) made an unfavorable decision that is 
unsupported by the record as a whole.</P> 
<P>Even assuming none of Applicant's family members were agents of the Lebanese government, Applicant still had the burden of demonstrating that his family 
members in Lebanon were not in positions where they are likely to be exploited by a foreign power.  Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of establishing that his relatives were 
not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to those relatives and the United States.  Mere 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error without a showing that the Judge's weighing of the evidence was 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  After reviewing the record evidence, the Board concludes that the Judge's decision not to apply Mitigating Condition 1 
is sustainable.</P> 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members are not casual.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0484 (February 1, 2002) at p. 5.  
Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not 
met his burden of establishing that his contacts with his relatives were casual and infrequent.  After reviewing the record evidence, the Board concludes that the 
Judge's decision not to apply Mitigating Condition 3 is sustainable.</P> 
<P>Regarding the Administrative Judge's overall unfavorable security clearance decision, Applicant's ability to cite to record evidence to which he contends the 
Judge should have given greater weight--such as the length of Applicant's United States citizenship and the extent of his financial and other ties to the United 
States--is not sufficient to demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  Merely because a Judge does not give greater weight to record evidence cited by the 
appealing party, it does not follow that the Judge simply ignored that evidence.  The Government has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, Applicant is 
anything but a loyal United States citizen.  However, the issue is not Applicant's loyalty, but whether he is vulnerable to foreign influence that could result in 
the compromise of classified information.  Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that 
Applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation to support a favorable security clearance determination.</P>
