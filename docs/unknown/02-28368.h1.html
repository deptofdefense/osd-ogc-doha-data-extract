<P>Applicant was convicted of possessing marijuana on two occasions in 1997, and one additional time while he was still a juvenile. He was found to be in 
contempt of court in 1998 for failing to successfully complete a court-ordered drug treatment program. He has not abused any controlled substance since 1999, 
has credibly explained the incorrect information he provided in a security clearance application he submitted and during the course of an interview, and has 
demonstrated he has totally rehabilitated himself. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past use of marijuana. Clearance is granted.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline H for drug involvement, and Guideline E for personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on June 24, 2004, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations 
except subparagraphs 1.b. and 2.a.. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on October 18, 2004, scheduling the hearing for November 9, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, and admitted 
into the record without an objection. Applicant testified at the hearing and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked AE 1-3, and admitted into 
the record without an objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. 
Three additional documents were timely received, marked as AE 4-6, and admitted into the record without an objection. The transcript was received on 
November 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicants' admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 25 years old, has never been married, and has no dependents. He graduated from high school in June 1997. He began working at a fast food 
restaurant as part of a work-study program while in high school, and continued in that employment until he quit as a result of a disagreement with management 
in March 2002 because he believed he was being forced out of his position as a shift manager. He was hired by his present employer, a defense contractor, in 
April 2002 as a laborer (technician apprentice). He was granted an interim clearance in April 2002, and no allegations of mishandling classified information 
have ever been made against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's letters of reference indicate he has proven himself to be a valued employee within the defense industry. He was promoted to technician level I in 
June 2003, having displayed ship surface preparation and painting skills superior to significantly more experienced personnel. He graduated from a 15-month 
long voluntary apprentice training program in January 2003 that he attended twice a week averaging between three to five hours a week. Following his 
graduation from the program he was promoted early to corrosion control technician level II effective January 24, 2004. He completed a blaster certification 
course in October 2004, continuing to display his willingness to go above and beyond what is normally required for his position. Applicant disclosed his 
criminal record to his project manager who thereafter wrote a letter on Applicant's behalf asking that his clean work record, personal growth, and valued 
employee status be factored into the security clearance decision making process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged in August 1997 with possession of about two grams of marijuana he had purchased for $10.00. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 
days in jail (suspended) and ordered to pay $460.00 in fines and court costs. His driving privileges were also suspended. He was charged again in November 
1997 with possession of about two grams of marijuana, and was again convicted. For this conviction he was sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended) and 
ordered to pay $310.00 in fines and court costs. His driving privileges were again suspended, and he was ordered to attend a substance abuse program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was admitted to the substance abuse program on December 22, 1997 when he was 18 years old. During the intake screening, Applicant admitted 
having used marijuana for the prior two years, consuming about two cigarettes every other day. His diagnosis upon admission was cannabis abuse. He tested 
positive for marijuana during an intake urine screen and in all subsequent screens. More intensive care was discussed with Applicant in March 1998. He denied 
needing the  increase care, and shortly thereafter ceased attending the program. He was charged with and found guilty of failing to comply with the program in 
April 1998, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and assessed court costs of $210.00.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a security clearance application in April 2002 and in response to a question asking for disclosure of his use of controlled substances in the 
previous seven years or since the age of 16 answered he had used marijuana on three occasions. He credibly testified he misunderstood the question and thought 
it was asking how many times he had been convicted of using a controlled substance. Applicant submitted a signed sworn statement on June 18, 2002 and 
stated he used marijuana about twice monthly from 1995 until about 1998/1999. He credibly explained the discrepancy between that statement and the use of 
marijuana he admitted during the intake interview was because during the 2002 interview he was explaining the amount of marijuana he was using when he 
decided to straighten out his life and quit using marijuana all together in 1999. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, Guideline H, pertaining to drug involvement, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, 
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. If they do not respect 
the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency between approximately 1995, when he was 16 years old, and 1999, when he was 20 years old, 
ranging from two marijuana cigarettes every other day during the early years and tapering off to a twice monthly use in about 1999 when he decided to stop 
abusing the substance all together. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse </EM>applies.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having viewed Applicant's demeanor, appearance, and manner of testifying, and giving due consideration to his work history, and the letters of reference he 
submitted, I find totally credible his assertion that he decided to change his lifestyle in 1999, and that he has not used marijuana since then.<A HREF="02-28368.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Mitigating 
Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future </EM>apply. Applicant has mitigated the 
security concern caused by his use of marijuana that ended in 1999 and Guideline H is decided for Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J based upon Applicant's multiple convictions for possession of marijuana and his 
conviction for failing to successfully complete the court ordered substance abuse program. DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once again, having viewed Applicant's demeanor, appearance, and manner of testifying, and giving due consideration to his work history, and the letters of 
reference he submitted, I find totally credible his assertion that he decided to change his lifestyle in 1999, and that he has not used marijuana since that year. 
Further, his commendable work record, most notably his voluntary effort to complete the 15-month long apprentice training program on his own time, 
demonstrates Applicant has matured significantly since 1999 and is unlikely to commit criminal conduct in the future. (MC) 1:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> The criminal behavior was not 
recent</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM> and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply. Applicant has 
mitigated the security concern that arises from his criminal conduct. Guideline J is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant neither deliberately provided false answers in the security clearance application he 
submitted, nor did he intentionally provide false information in the statement he submitted. Further, I find credible his explanation for the circumstances 
surrounding his leaving employment with the fast food restaurant. No disqualifying condition exists under Guideline E, and it is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in 
this case, including Applicant's character references, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN></P>
