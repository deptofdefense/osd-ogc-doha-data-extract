<P>Applicant's ex-wife, a Russian citizen and a permanent U.S. resident, has custody of their six-year-old son, to whom Applicant is very devoted.  Applicant's 
current wife is a Ukrainian citizen and a permanent U.S. resident.  Her mother is a Ukrainian citizen residing in Russia.  Her father and brother are Russian

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 14, 2005, admitted the allegations, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me 
on July 27, 2005, and heard as scheduled on September 12, 2005.  I kept the record open to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence.  I received his 
evidence on September 20, 2005, and it is incorporated in the record as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) I through M.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
September 21, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since September 1997.  He previously served thirteen years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, 
transferred to the Air Force Reserve, and retired in November 1994 as a major.  He received numerous awards and commendations while in the Air Force.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He 
has held a security clearance since 1997.  His current employer regards him as talented, hard-working, dedicated, and trustworthy.  He has been commended by 
supervisors, including the president of his company, on numerous occasions, received outstanding performance reports, and several monetary awards.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  
Applicant's security officer attested to his talent, responsibility, and trustworthiness.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant is financially secure and has an excellent credit rating.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married to a U.S. citizen in April 1990 and divorced in June 1996.  In September 1997, he traveled to Russia to meet a Russian woman he had 
met on the internet.  Their relationship ended after this visit.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1998, Applicant traveled to Russia to meet another Russian woman he had met on the internet.  Sponsored by Applicant, she came to the U.S. on a K-1 
"fianc&eacute;" visa, and they were married in September 1998.  According to State Department records, K-1 visas from Russia and Ukraine are common.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his second wife separated in September 2002, because she refused to have any more children.  She is a citizen of Russia residing in the U.S. as a 
permanent resident.  Applicant has no ties of affection to his ex-wife.  To the contrary, Applicant is bitter about the divorce, but he is very devoted to his 6-year-old son from that marriage.  His ex-wife has custody of their son, and Applicant has visitation rights for two of every three weekends.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented no evidence about his ex-wife's background, current employment, education, connections to foreign governments, or vulnerability to 
coercion or duress.  He did not present any evidence regarding financial obligations he may have to his ex-wife as the custodial parent.  Applicant considers his 
ex-wife's parents as "good, kind people," but he has no contact with his former in-laws, in part because of the language barrier.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 2002, Applicant traveled to Russia to meet a Ukranian woman he met on the internet.  She came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa in January 2004, and 
they were married in March 2004. Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen of Ukraine residing in Russia.  His father-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and 
residents of Russia.  Applicant's mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law live in the southern portion of Russia, and they own and operate an 
agricultural tool business.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Neither Applicant's wife nor her immediate family has been connected with the Russian or Ukrainian Governments.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's current wife is now a permanent resident of the U.S., due to give birth to a child in March 2006, and states she intends to become a U.S. citizen.  
She obtained the U.S. equivalent of a master's degree in aviation engineering, but she has never worked in the aviation industry.  Before coming to the U.S., she 
managed a photo processing center in Ukraine.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Since coming to the U.S., she has formed friendships among several women of Russian heritage.  Applicant 
testified his wife "admires and respects the United States and its laws, as well as the natural beauty of the country."<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant's wife testified but did not 
express her views of the U.S. or Ukraine.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife has almost daily e-mail communication with her immediate  family, but they do not talk about Applicant's work.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  She has a grandmother, an 
aunt, and an uncle in Ukraine, but has contact with them only about twice a year.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Her parents cannot understand English.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant has virtually no direct 
contact with his wife's immediate family because of the language barrier. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ukraine has a presidential and parliamentary system of government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  It is governed by a directly-elected president, a prime minister, and a unicameral parliament.  After becoming an independent country, Ukraine established its own military forces, using 
troops and equipment inherited from the Soviet Union.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  It is undergoing significant economic, political, and social change.  Because of wide income 
disparities, crimes against institutions and individuals perceived to be wealthy are widespread.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ukraine has a poor human rights record.  Continuing problems include arbitrary arrest and detention, abuse of detainees and prisoners, police corruption, 
political interference with the judiciary, illegal searches of mail and monitoring of electronic communications, and infringement of freedom of the press and the 
right of peaceful assembly.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Because Ukraine does not recognize dual nationality, American citizens entering Ukraine with a Ukranian passport are treated as 
Ukrainian citizens.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">U.S. policy toward Ukraine is focused on fostering development of a democratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine, and integrating it into European and Euro-Atlantic alliances.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Although Ukraine unilaterally gave up its nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, problems between the U.S. and Ukraine have arisen 
in the past because of Ukraine's transfers of dangerous weapons to countries in the Balkans.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Russian government consists of a strong president, a prime minister, and a bicameral legislature.  The judiciary is the least developed branch of 
government, with problems of internal corruption and executive branch influence on high profile cases.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Russian government has a restrictive and complicated system of visas for foreign travelers.  U.S. citizens and dual-citizen  minors with Russian passports 
face complicated problems.  U.S. citizens who previously held Russian citizenship are often required to renounce Russian citizenship before they can apply for 
a Russian visa on a U.S. passport. Russian immigration and visa laws change regularly and unpredictably.  Every foreign traveler is required to have a Russian-based sponsor such as a hotel, tour company, relative, or an employer.  The Russian government does not recognize the standing of U.S. consular officers to act 
or intervene in visa problems.  Foreigners frequently are harassed or mistreated by law enforcement and other officials.  Extortion and corruption in business are 
common.  Travel to Chechnya and all areas that border it is dangerous.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Russia has generally respected the human rights of its citizens in some areas, but its record in areas such as Chechnya is poor.  Although the Russian 
constitution permits entering a private residence only in cases authorized by federal law or a judicial decision and requires judicial permission to monitor 
correspondence, telephone conversations, and other means of communication, these requirements are not rigorously enforced.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Numerous terrorist acts have occurred in Russia during the past several years.  Although these acts were not directed at U.S. citizens, there is a general risk 
posed by indiscriminate terrorist attacks.<A HREF="04-03354.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members 
of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's testimony regarding his inability to 
speak Russian and his limited contacts with his in-laws are sufficient to rebut the presumption of affection for his wife's immediate family, but insufficient to 
rebut the presumption that he has ties of obligation to them.  I conclude DC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brief relationship with a Russian woman in 1997, alleged in SOR &para; 1.a., apparently did not go beyond initial exploratory contacts.  I conclude this 
relationship has no security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The family circumstances of Applicant's ex-wife and son, referred to in SOR &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.d., have security significance, because they are relevant to "potential 
for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Directive &para; E2.2.1.8.  Applicant's ex-wife, who has custody of their son, is a Russian citizen, and her immediate 
family are Russian citizens and residents.  Applicant introduced no evidence rebutting or mitigating his vulnerability to coercion or pressure from his ex-wife or 
her immediate family by exploiting his strong affection for his son.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise if an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the 
potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  Because Applicant is married to and lives with a Ukrainian citizen with family ties in Russia and 
Ukraine, DC 2 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant rebutted the allegation in SOR &para; 1.c. that his current marriage is not legally recognized in the U.S.  The remainder of SOR &para; 1.c. duplicates the 
allegation in SOR &para; 1.e.  When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant's favor.  <EM>See</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR &para; 1.c. in Applicant's favor.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members. . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 2, the burden shifted 
to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly 
governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion.  The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's wife has very close ties to her immediate family, as evidenced by her almost-daily contact with them.  She has lived in the U.S. for 
less than two years.  Applicant's wife testified at the hearing, but revealed very little about her political views, familial relationships, attitudes toward the U.S. 
or Ukrainian governments, or her personal aspirations, due in part to her apparent shyness and limited ability to express herself in English.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant established that his wife and her immediate family are not agents of a foreign power, connected to the Russian or Ukraine governments, and not 
involved in businesses vulnerable to government sponsored industrial espionage or private economic espionage.  However, Applicant did not present any 
evidence about his ex-wife and her immediate family.  Thus, he has not established he is not vulnerable to coercion or pressure from his Russian ex-wife and 
her family through exploitation of his strong affection for his son.  After evaluating each family member's individual circumstances as well as the totality of 
Applicant's family ties to the Ukraine and Russia, I conclude MC 1 is established for his wife and immediate family members but not established for his ex-wife, her immediate family members, and his son</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  
Applicant continues to have contact with his ex-wife regarding visitation.  Such contacts, although not necessarily friendly, are not casual because they pertain 
to their son, to whom Applicant is very attached.  Thus, MC 3 is not established for Applicant's ex-wife.  Because of the language barrier, Applicant's contacts 
with his wife's immediate family are virtually non-existent.  Thus, I conclude MC 3 is established for his wife's immediate family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Likewise, the nature of the governments of Ukraine and Russia, their human 
rights records, and their relationships with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are relevant factors in determining whether Russia or 
Ukraine are reasonably likely to exploit or threaten their private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the final analysis, an applicant has
