  Under the Directive, the Board does not re-try a security clearance case on appeal.  Rather, the Board reviews an Administrative Judge's decision to determine whether an appealing party has raised an issue that demonstrates factual or legal error by the Judge.  Applicant has not shown that the Judge weighed  the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge's unchallenged findings of fact about Applicant's history of financial  difficulties provide a rational basis for the Judge's unfavorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 6, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated June 22, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether there is a rational basis for the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether there is a rational basis for the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge made findings of fact about 
Applicant's history of financial difficulties and concluded that Applicant had not presented evidence of extenuation or mitigation sufficient to warrant a 
favorable security clearance decision.<A HREF="03-16888.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge's findings of fact about his history of financial difficulties.  
However, Applicant does argue the following: (1) the Board should "rethink the decision to revoke or deny a clearance for me"; (2) he did not try to hide his 
financial difficulties from the federal government; (3) his military service and work record with a defense contractor should weigh in his favor; and (4) he 
would do nothing to harm the United States or the U.S. military.  The Board construes Applicant's arguments as raising the issue of whether there is a rational 
basis for the Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.</P> 
<P>Under the Directive, the Board does not re-try a security clearance case on appeal.  Rather, the Board reviews an Administrative Judge's decision to determine 
whether an appealing party has raised an issue on appeal that demonstrates factual or legal error by the Judge.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Item E3.1.32.  Accordingly, the Board will not review Applicant's case in order to decide whether it would reach the same decision as the Judge did.  The 
Board will consider whether Applicant's appeal identifies any factual or legal error by the Judge.</P> 
<P>Applicant's argument about not hiding his financial difficulties from the federal government is moot.  The Administrative Judge specifically found that 
Applicant did not falsify a security clearance application (as alleged in SOR paragraph 2.a) and entered a formal finding in Applicant's favor with respect to that 
aspect of the case.</P> 
<P>The record evidence concerning Applicant's military service and employment with a defense contractor was relevant to his case, but it did not compel the 
Administrative Judge, as a matter of law, to make a favorable security clearance case.  A Judge must consider the record evidence, both favorable and 
unfavorable, decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>, and reach a reasoned decision as to whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-00578 (April 6, 2004) at p. 3.  
Applicant's argument about his military record and employment history  does not demonstrate the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, or that the Judge reached conclusions about Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties that are not warranted in 
light of the record evidence as a whole.</P> 
<P>The federal government does not have to wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can deny or revoke access to classified information.  
<EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  A history of unresolved financial difficulties raises security 
concerns.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-13281 (October 22, 2004) at p. 4 (discussing security significance of a history of financial difficulties).  The 
Administrative Judge's unchallenged findings of fact about Applicant's history of financial difficulties provide a rational basis for his conclusion that security 
concerns were raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Furthermore, Applicant's appeal fails to demonstrate the Judge erred by concluding that 
Applicant had not presented evidence of extenuation or mitigation sufficient to rebut or overcome the security concerns raised under Guideline F.</P>
