<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><EM></EM>Applicant, a naturalized citizen of the US who was a citizen of Israel solely by virtue of his birth and has not actively pursued his dual 
citizenship with Israel since becoming a US citizen, extenuates and mitigates security concerns associated with his active maintenance of 
a dual citizenship between Israel and the US.  Applicant's immediate family members who reside in Israel are not shown to be at any 
potential risk to pressure or coercion sufficient to pose continuing foreign influence concerns.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 21, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed 
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR (undated) and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 21, 
2001and was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on September 21, 2001, for the purpose of considering whether it would 
be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the 
Government's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the 
proceedings was received on October 25, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the close of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence in accordance with E3.1.17 of 
the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive.  Specifically, Department Counsel moved to amend sub-paragraph 1.b to read 
Applicant would be willing to bear arms for Israel.  There being no objection to the amendment, and for good cause shown, the 
amendment was granted.  Applicant, in turn, was asked if the amendment would affect his answer in any way.  He replied that he would 
not want to take up arms for Israel against the US and had no reason to believe that Israel and the US would ever be adversaries.  His 
answer was incorporated by inter-lineation, sans any claimed need by Applicant to provide any additional evidence to clarify or 
reinforce his answer to the Government's amendment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the evidence, Applicant asked for leave to supplement the record with documentation of his being granted a 
security clearance.  No objections forthcoming from the Government, and good cause being shown, Applicant was afforded fifteen (15) 
days to supplement the record with documentation of his being granted a security clearance.  Government, in turn, was granted five (5) 
days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided a copy of his grant of an interim clearance in March 1999, which 
Department Counsel did not object to.  The interim clearance documentation is admitted as Applicant's exhibit A.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year old UPS specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a  security clearance at the level of secret.  He has held an 
interim clearance since March 1999, which provides him limited access to classified information (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 25-27).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is alleged to (1) consider himself a citizen of Israel, despite the requirement that he renounce his citizenship when naturalized 
as a US citizen and (2) disclaim any willingness to bear arms for the US against Israel.</P> 
 
<P>Additionally, Applicant is alleged to be at risk to foreign influence by virtue of having (a) his parents, brother, aunts, and uncles reside in 
Israel as citizens of Israel, (b) another sister who is an Israeli citizen currently residing in the United Kingdom and (c) a son with dual 
citizenship with the US and Israel.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to (a) to having dual citizenship with Israel by virtue of his birth in Israel, but to being a 
US citizen first and foremost, which does not conflict with his dual Israeli citizenship, and to (b) his unwillingness to bear arms for the US 
against Israel (he would be neutral were such a hypothetical conflict to arise).  He denies he would ever disclose or share any classified 
information with his relatives in Israel, regardless of the circumstances.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A citizen of Israel by birth, Applicant was raised in Israel by his parents of Israeli birth and citizenship.  As an Israeli citizen and resident, 
military service was mandatory.  Applicant served in the Israeli air force before  emigrating to the US in 1976.  He applied for and 
became a naturalized US citizen in September 1987.  Not required to renounced his Israeli citizenship with his US naturalization, he did 
not, and still considers himself an Israeli citizen by birth (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 34-35).  The only time he has traveled to Israel since 
emigrating to the US was in 1984 (before he became a naturalized citizen) to visit his family, which he completed with his Israeli 
passport (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 41-42).  Having allowed his old Israeli passport to expire some years ago (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 43), he does not hold an 
Israeli or any other foreign passport and has no intention of acquiring one.  He owns no land holdings in Israel and has no foreign 
business interests there.  To the best of his knowledge, he has no benefit entitlements by virtue of his Israeli citizenship and has no 
intention of ever returning to Israel.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant assures that while he would not want to take up arms for the US against Israel in a hypothetical conflict (R.T., at 37), he 
cannot conceive of the US and Israel ever being adversaries of each other.  He would never take up arms against the US for Israel and 
would defend US interests whenever he was called upon (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 36-37).  Only if Israel were not in a confrontation or conflict with 
the US would he be willing to take up arms for Israel (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 37-38, 62).  Applicant's claims appear to be straightforward and 
sincere and are accepted.</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant has no current intent to renounce his Israeli citizenship and perforce turn his back on his family, he has no intention 
either of ever acquiring an Israeli passport for travel to Israel (<EM>see</EM> R.T., 48-49).  Only if he were required to obtain an Israeli passport 
to exit Israel in a hypothetical situation would he consider obtaining one, and in such circumstances, he would immediately mail back to 
Israel authorities after he returned to the US (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 57).  And he reassures he has no intention of traveling to Israel in any case.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has maintained irregular contact with his parents and other relatives residing in Israel and the UK, respectively, since 
becoming a US citizen and does not provide them with any financial assistance (R.T., at 46-47).  Nor has he sponsored any other's 
application to emigrate to the US.  He assures he has no reason to believe that any of them is vulnerable to coercion or pressure (<EM>see</EM> 
R.T., at 53).  Applicant's  account is accepted.  While his father was at one time a high ranking officer in Israel's military, he has been 
retired for over seventeen years and is in no known position to pressure and coerce or be pressured or coerced by Israeli authorities to 
elicit classified information from Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision 
making process covering DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider 
all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the 
"Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative 
Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or 
she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: The exercise of dual citizenship</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or 
she may be bound by affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual 
potentially vulnerable to coercion</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be 
made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires 
Administrative Judges to make a common sense decision.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences 
which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are 
grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it 
must demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus </SPAN>to the</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny 
or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the 
applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings as an emigre from Israel who became a naturalized citizen of the US in 1987 and has never 
exercised any active indicia of dual citizenship with Israel since his becoming a US citizen</SPAN>.  Claiming his principal affections lie with the 
US, he, nonetheless, disclaims any willingness to take up active arms for the US against Israel, or <EM>vice versa,</EM> should a hypothetical 
confrontation or conflict erupt in the future. </P> 
 
<P>Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or 
not for the interests of the foreign country over the interests of the US.  In a different vein, the continued residence of his parents and 
immediate family members in Israel and the UK  raise potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future pressure or coercion that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant's  preference for a foreign 
country over the US and the potential for members of Applicant's immediate family being placed at risk to pressure or coercion to 
induce Applicant to divulge classified information he might be privy to.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of his birth in Israel to parents of Israeli descent and citizenship, Applicant was  endowed with Israeli citizenship through his 
parents.  This citizenship could not be lost except by express renunciation of the holder.  This, Applicant  has never done.   Since 
becoming a naturalized US citizen in 1987, Applicant has taken no actions and exercised no Israeli privileges that can be fairly 
characterized as active indicia of dual citizenship.  He has not served </SPAN>in the Israeli military or voted in Israeli elections since emigrating to 
the US in 1976.  He holds no property or financial interests in Israel and has accepted no educational, medical or other benefits from 
Israel since becoming a US citizen.  Nor has he ever perform or attempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the 
interests of Israel in preference to the interests of the US since becoming a US citizen.</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant hedges on his willingness to take up arms for the US against his native Israel, this reluctance by itself is not enough 
to create an indicia of preference for his birth country.  Americans are steeped in their ethnic roots with countries other than the US and 
can be expected to harbor varying degrees of pride for the countries of their parents.  Love of ethnic roots is not by itself a disqualifying 
preference under DC 9 of the Adjudicative Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>Overall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the US.  He satisfies his burden threshold in several ways: demonstrated lack of 
any prior exercise of any privileges associated with his Israeli citizenship and demonstrated firm support of the US and its institutions 
since becoming a naturalized US citizen.  Applicable  mitigating conditions entail: MC 1 (dual citizenship based solely on parent's 
citizenship).  Credited with being a dedicated and trustworthy defense contractor, he absolves himself of foreign preference concerns 
and carries his evidentiary burden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his birth country (Israel) or his adopted 
country (US).  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Besides foreign preference concerns, Government finds security risks associated with Applicant's parents, siblings, aunts and uncles 
being foreign nationals, residing either in Israel or GB.  Because  Applicant's parent and brother (immediate family members) continue 
to be citizens of and reside in Israel, their status raises security concerns covered by disqualifying condition 1 (DC 1) of the Adjudication 
Guidelines for foreign influence.  The continued residence status of these immediate family members in Israel pose some potential 
concerns for Applicant because of the risks of coercion or influence brought to bear on these family members that could compromise 
classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control.  From what is known from Applicant's testimony, none of 
Applicant's immediate family residing in Israel have a current working relationship with Israel's government: His father, a former Israeli 
officer, has long since retired and poses no present threat to exploitation by the Israeli government.  And none of Applicant's immediate 
family members are known to Applicant to be vulnerable to any risk of coercion or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate p<EM>er se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen 
set of guidelines covering risks of foreign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in 
another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for 
referencing.  Personnel security investigations continue to be governed by the same Change 2 requirements of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R for appraising the security risks associated with the individual's having family abroad: These investigatory requirements of the 
Regulation as they pertain to hostage situations were never deleted or replaced and retain their applicability according to the dictates of 
individual cases.  <EM>See </EM>32 C.F.R. Sec. l54.8 (1998) (corresponds to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Sec. 2-403).<A HREF="00-0317.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  And Section 6.1 of the 
Directive (under procedures) provides that industrial security clearance applicants be investigated in accordance with the governing 
DoD regulations.</P> 
 
<P>So, under these investigatory guidelines, while an applicant with immediate family domiciled in a hypothetical hostile country might pose 
a risk of a hostage situation, he might conversely be able to neutralize material risks of exploitation of immediate family members residing 
in a friendly country.  Israel is not considered historically to be a hostile country among those that have been the subject of studies of 
friendly and unfriendly  countries practicing industrial espionage in recent years.  <EM>Cf. </EM>G. Gilder, <EM>Geniuses from Abroad </EM>(Wall Street J. 
December 18, 1995); S. Wood &amp; C. Chandler, <EM>Selected Economic Espionage Incidents Against the United States, 1980-1994</EM>: 
<EM>An Open-Source Research Project </EM>(Defense PSRC), cited with approval in DoD's Adjudicative Desk reference (ADR).  Israel can 
be classed as a friendly country known to pose reasonably manageable hostage risks.</P> 
 
<P>While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the character of the subject country, 
they should not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  And in Applicant's 
case, the country of his ethnic heritage has a considerable history of stable democratic institutions and no corresponding history of 
exerting pressure or influence to compromise the security interests of the US.  Applicant may, accordingly, rely on the mitigation benefits 
of MC 1of of the Adjudicative Guidelines (immediate family members in a foreign country neither agents of foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited).</P> 
 
<P>So, notwithstanding the continued presence of Applicant's immediate family members in Israel their presence there does not present any 
potential risk of a hostage situation.  Their Israeli citizenship and residence constitutes an acceptable one, for which the mitigation 
benefits of MC 1 (presence of immediate family in host country does not pose an acceptable security risk) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines may be availed of by Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Considering the record as a whole, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having immediate family members in Israel 
are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure 
attributable to his familial relationships in Israel.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a through 2.c of 
Guideline B. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions 
enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
