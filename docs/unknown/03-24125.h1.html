survive the war.  He worked in Aden (now Yemen) for British Airlines and then for the United States Army in Iran and Ethiopia.  He was married to a Yemen 
citizen, but she divorced him and moved with their three children to Yemen in 1968.  He came to the United States in 1972 and has not visited Yemen.  Two of 
his three children now live in the United States.  He has infrequent contact with his former wife and son in Yemen.  He located his sister in France in 2001 but

foreign government.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 14, 2004, The Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb 20, 1990), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 9, 2004.  The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence) of the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 24, 2004.  He admitted allegation 1 and 3 and denied allegations 2 and 4 in the SOR.  He requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The request for hearing was received by the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) on July 1, 2004.  Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed with the case on September 3, 2004, and the case was assigned to me on October 20, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on 
October 27, 2004.  The hearing was held on November 17, 2004.  Three Government exhibits, two Applicant exhibits and the testimony of the Applicant were 
received during the hearing.  The transcript was received on November 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 67-year-old aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor.  He was born in France before World War II and lost all of his family, except a sister, 
during the war.  His father was a British citizen from what was then called Aden and now is Yemen.  His mother was German.  Applicant was a French citizen 
with a French passport, because he was born in France.  Applicant was raised in an orphanage in France after the war.  In approximately 1959, Applicant moved 
to Aden, a British Protectorate, to work for British Airlines.  He was a British citizen with a British passport since his father was British. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant lived in Aden (Yemen) for approximately four years.   He married a Yemen woman and shortly thereafter they left Yemen so Applicant could work 
for the United States Army as an aircraft mechanic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  Applicant and his wife had three children born in 1964, 1966, and 1968.  
Applicant's wife left him in 1968 and returned to Yemen taking the children with her.  Applicant was transferred to Tehran, Iran by the United States Army to 
continue working as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer.  When the British left Aden, he had to return his British passport and had to apply for a Yemen 
passport.  He did not go to Yemen to obtain the passport but sent his application by mail.  Applicant's first wife divorced him when she returned to Yemen and 
obtained custody of the children.  Applicant did not visit his children in Yemen and was only in Yemen for the four years.  When the United States Army left 
Iran and because of the unrest in Yemen and Iran and the Applicant's work with the United States Army, the Army sponsored Applicant to come to the United 
States in 1972 to work as an aircraft mechanic.  He is now married to a United States citizen and they reside together in the United States with their daughter.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had very little contact with his former wife, a retired phone company employee,  and children in Yemen from 1968 until 1998.  He heard from his 
former wife and children in 1998 when his daughter asked him to sponsor her entry into the United States.  His youngest son followed his sister and Applicant 
sponsored his entry into the United States in 2000.  His daughter and son are adults and reside together in the United States not far from Applicant.  They are 
employed but Applicant does help them financially.  He last talked to his wife four years ago when he was sponsoring his son to enter the United States.  His 
other son resides in Yemen and works for a bank.  He has not seen him since 1966 and has little contact with him.  His two children who reside in the United 
States are presently on a visit to Yemen to see their mother and brother as part of the religious observance of Ramadan.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's sister is his only living relative after World War II.  He was able to track her down and visited her in France in 2001.  He has not had contact with 
her in approximately two years.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to ... control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
... that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> At 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>&sect; 3.1 (b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility 
for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6</P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance." Directive &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM>Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</P> 
 
<P>The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. "[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</P> 
 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determination should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see</EM> Directive &para;E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a security concern exists when an individual's immediate family, and other persons to whom he may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive  &para; E2.A2.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's former wife and his son in Yemen and his sister in France brings this matter under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition Directive &para; 
E2.A2.1.1.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in 
a foreign country)</EM>.  Immediate family members are <EM>spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.</EM>  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  Applicant's former 
wife and his son in Yemen and his sister in France are immediate family members residing in and citizens of a foreign country.  I conclude that the 
disqualifying condition has been established.</P> 
 
<P>The conditions that may mitigate this disqualifying condition are:  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in 
a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved or the United States</EM>); 
and Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 (<EM>contact and correspondence with the foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>).  Applicant has little contact with his former wife 
and son in Yemen.  The last time he spoke to his former wife in Yemen was over four years ago.  The last time he saw his son in Yemen was in 1966 and he 
only talks to him rarely.  Neither the former wife or son work for the government.  While his two other children are presently in Yemen, they are there on their 
own to visit family as part of a religious custom.  Applicant and his sister were separated after World War II and did not see each other until 2001 when 
Applicant went to France to find her.  Applicant has not talked to his sister in over a year.  I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the disqualifying condition 
under Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude that Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1, Guideline B   FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:    For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:    For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c.:    For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.d.:    For Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.</P>
