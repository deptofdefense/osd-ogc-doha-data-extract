<P>While holding an interim security clearance, and for a period of several weeks, Applicant used his employer's computers to access pornographic web sites.  He was fired after his employer discovered 
his conduct.  Applicant asserts he used his employer's computer to access and view pornography because he suffered depression caused by his work situation.  Applicant has subsequently been 
diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Component by a psychiatrist, who has prescribed daily medication.  Applicant, who continues to access pornography on his personal computer,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 4, 2005, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="05-06924.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of 
Defense Directive,<A HREF="05-06924.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct)of the Directive. On November 28, 2005,  Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another 
administrative judge on March 29, 2006.  On June 20, 2006, the case was assigned to me when regional assignments were rotated.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 22, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no 
witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which were identified and numbered Ex. 1 through 5.  The Government withdrew Ex. 5 as redundant.  The remaining Government exhibits were admitted without 
objection.  Applicant called one witness and introduced three exhibits, which were identified as Exs. A, B, and C, and admitted without objection. At the conclusion of the evidence, I left the record 
open until October 2, 2006, so that Applicant could, if he wished, submit a letter from his psychiatrist specifying his diagnosis and treatment.   Applicant timely filed such a letter, which was identified 
as Applicant's  Ex. D and entered in the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on October 3, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR in this case contains one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems, and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, 
Personal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant will be 33 years old in December 2006.  He graduated from college in 2001 with a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering.  He has been employed since January 2005 as an 
applications engineer by a government contractor.  (Tr. 54; Ex. 1, Ex. A.)  Applicant has been married for approximately five years.  He and his wife met while in college. (Tr. 42, 44-45.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was hired by Employer A in August 2001 as an engineer/scientist 1.  He worked for his employer for two years at two job sites in State B.  After two years, Applicant transferred to another 
division within Employer A's company and took a position identified as flight engineer. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's position as flight engineer required that he transfer to a work site and to a project in another part of the U.S.  His employer also required that he apply for a security clearance. He was 
assigned to work temporarily in State C and to wait there until assigned to the work site in State D.  Applicant's wife accompanied him to State C.  The couple arrived in State C in the latter part of July 
2003. (Tr. 52.)  While on the temporary assignment, Applicant's household goods were placed in storage, and he and his wife lived in a hotel.  He received his regular salary of approximately $53,000 
per annum and per diem.  (Tr. 72-73.)  When he arrived in State C, Applicant was informed he had been granted a security clearance.  (Ex. 3; Tr. 61-62.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant began working for Employer A in State C, he was assigned to the first shift, where he worked for approximately three weeks.  On one occasion, after the other first shift employees had 
left for the day, Applicant stayed at work and accessed pornographic web sites on  the computer assigned to him by Employer A. (Ex. 2 at 8.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor, who was not aware Applicant had accessed pornographic web sites during the first shift, then asked him to work the second shift in order to fill in for an employee on vacation.  
Applicant was assigned to the second shift from August 22, 2003 through September 26, 2003.  He found he was able to complete his regularly assigned second shift work in about two hours.  He was 
then assigned to stand by to sign off on aircraft maintenance issues.  Applicant worked alone for several hours during the second shift.  He spent three to four hours a night surfing the Internet.  That 
activity included accessing pornographic sites when no other employees were in the work area.  (Ex. 2 at 8; Tr.58-60.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the period beginning August 22, 2003, and ending September 26, 2003, Applicant used two computers in his work area to access pornographic material.  (Ex. 2 at 2-7.)  After returning to first 
shift work, Applicant stayed after work and continued to access pornographic web sites when the other employees had left for the day.  (Tr. 60-61.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Employer A initiated an investigation of computer access when an audit of the company's  "access denied" report for September 2003 indicated an unusually high number of denials to web sites 
considered inappropriate for the workplace.  An internal investigation identified Applicant as the person accessing pornographic sites.  He was interviewed and signed a statement admitting using his 
employer's computers to access pornographic material and acknowledging his actions were against company policy.  (Ex. 2 at 8-9.)  On December 10, 2003, Employer A issued an Employee Corrective 
Action Memo to Applicant.  In pertinent part, the Memo read::</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">You have used [Company A's]-provided computer workstations to access, and/or attempt to access, non-work related, restricted and inappropriate websites, and you have mischarged your labor time 
while performing these activities during your normal work hours.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">You will be discharged from [Company A] effective Thursday, 11 December 2003 (last day on payroll). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Ex. 4 at 2, 3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In explanation, Applicant stated he and his wife felt considerable stress while in State C because they didn't know when they would be leaving to live in State D. They had expected to stay in State C for 
about one week and then transfer to State D.  Instead, his assignment to the company's facility in State C lasted for 2 &frac12; months.  During that time, Applicant's wife became ill with gall bladder 
problems.  Applicant suggested the stresses he and his wife experienced caused him to be depressed and to seek pornography to relieve his stress.  (Tr. 31-33.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been under treatment by a psychiatrist for approximately eighteen months.  He was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Component.  He takes daily medication for 
depression, and he consults with his doctor every three months.  He believes his depression is under control.  (Tr. 64-65, 77; Ex. D.)  He currently accesses pornographic material on his home computer.  
He thinks his use of pornographic material might be related to habit. (Tr. 70-72.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant took responsibility for his conduct and did not attempt to hide it from his family or on his security clearance application.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 18-19; 29-31; 39-41.)  His current employer praises 
Applicant's  professional work ethic and his dedication to his job.  His  performance review for the period January 17, 2005 to January 16, 2006 indicates he exceeds expectations on all job review 
elements.  (Ex. A, B, C.)  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The 
President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of 
character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is 
predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an 
applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the 
guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology Systems</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline M of the Directive that Applicant was fired from his job with Employer A after an investigation revealed he had accessed sexually explicit internet sites 
without authorization on two of his employer's computers, knowing that such access was non-work related, restricted, and inappropriate.  Additionally, DOHA alleged Applicant mischarged his labor 
time while performing these unauthorized activities during normal work hours, conduct that was specifically prohibited by company rules, procedures, and guidelines.(&para; 1.a.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's many unauthorized entries into his employer's technology system during at least August and September 2003 violated his employer's policy and procedures.  Applicant's conduct raises 
security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A.13.1.2.1. of Guideline M.  Three years have passed since Applicant misused his employer's computer system, and thus his misuse was not 
recent.  However, the misuse was significant.  The record evidence and Applicant's credible testimony indicate his misuse of his employer's computer system was knowing and deliberate.  His misuse of 
his employer's information technology system occurred repeatedly over a period of several weeks and was not limited to isolated events.  Accordingly, while Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A.13.1.3.1. 
applies in part, MC E2.A.13.1.3.2. and MC E2.A.13.1.3.4. are inapplicable to the facts of Applicant's case.<A HREF="05-06924.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, MC E2.A13.1.3.5. does not apply to Applicant's case, since his misuse was carried out surreptitiously and was not followed by a prompt, good faith effort to correct the situation.<A HREF="05-06924.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  I 
conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the disqualifying conduct alleged in &para; 1.a. of the SOR </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant misused his employer's information technology system as alleged in &para; 1.a. and that the misuse reflected questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and further suggested Applicant may not properly safeguard classified information. 
(&para;2.a.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E conduct raises security concerns because it involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations and could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct raises security concerns under three Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E.  First, reliable, unfavorable information about Applicant's alleged unprofessional conduct 
and questionable judgment was provided by his employer, raising a concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.1. of the Guideline.  Second, Applicant's alleged personal conduct, which included the secretive misuse 
of his employer's computer system to access pornographic material, increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, raising a concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.4.  Third, Applicant's alleged 
disqualifying personal conduct reflected a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, raising a concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.5.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to an examination of possible Mitigating Conditions (MC) under the Guideline.  The information about Applicant's unprofessional conduct that was provided by his employer is pertinent to a 
determination of his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  Therefore, MC E2.A5.1.3.1 is inapplicable.  At his hearing, Applicant provided evidence he had sought psychiatric treatment for his 
depression, a condition he said caused him to access pornographic material.  However, he also provided evidence that even after treatment, he continued to access pornography, albeit privately and 
legally on his personal computer, out of habit, thus raising the issue of continued vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Accordingly, MC E2.A5.1.3.5. is inapplicable, and the Guideline E 
allegation of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of evidence and under all the Directive guidelines that were generally applicable or might 
be applicable to the facts of this case.  Under the whole person concept, as specified at &para; E2.2.of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, I conclude Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the Government's case 
opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. </SPAN></P>
