<P>Applicant's financial problems began in 1991 when she sustained injuries which led to a period of unemployment.  After trying unsuccessfully to pay her debts, 
she filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 1992 and received a discharge of her debts.  In 1999, events beyond her control, including a job layoff and medical 
care for herself and an infant child, who later died, caused her to fall back into debt.  Applicant asserts that she was unaware of the status of many of her 
delinquent accounts at the time she filed her application for a security clearance.  Subsequently, she reviewed her credit report and developed a plan for paying 
her debts and rehabilitating her credit standing.  She has put in over 1400 hours of overtime work to earn the money to pay the debts alleged in the Statement of 
Reasons and to cure her financial instability.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On February 5, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-28896.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-28896.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its 
decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the 
Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 3, 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was initially 
assigned to Administrative Judge Roger Willmeth, but due to caseload considerations, was subsequently assigned to me on June 3, 2003.  A Notice of Hearing 
was issued on June 19, 2003 scheduling the hearing for July 10, 2003.  On July 10, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government submitted nine exhibits (Ex.) and Applicant submitted seventeen.  
The Government called no witnesses and Applicant called one.  At the conclusion of the hearing, without objection from either Party, the record was held open 
for 30 days for Applicant to submit additional evidence if she so wished.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 21, 2003.  On August 10, 2003, Applicant 
filed, by facsimile, a 9-page document, including her transmittal message, containing additional information on accounts that had a balance due on the day of 
her hearing.  Without objection from Department Counsel, Applicant's additional submissions were admitted into evidence in this matter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR in this case contains 23 allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Eighteen allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations.  Four allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and one allegation relates to conduct charged under Guideline 
J, Criminal Conduct. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the factual allegations as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i. of the SOR, involving Financial 
Considerations under Guideline F.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations at 1.j., 1.k., 1.m., 1.p., and 1.q., under Guideline F, the 
allegations at 2.a., 2.b., 2.b.(1), and 2.b.(2) under Guideline E, and the allegation at 3.a. under Guideline J.  She stated that she "agreed" with the allegations at 
1.l.,1.n., 1.o., and 1.r.<A HREF="02-28896.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of 
the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, who is 38 years old, has worked for two and one-half years as a radiological control technician for a defense contractor.  She is married and the 
mother of two daughters and a step daughter.  Since 2000, she has been a Navy reservist.  She is in the process of completing a college education.  Last year she 
put in over 1430 hours of overtime work to earn extra money to pay off her debts and rehabilitate her credit rating.  Applicant and her husband have 
prequalified for a home loan and have plans to build a house.  At present, they and their three children live in an apartment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1991, when Applicant was single and the sole support of her older daughter, she sustained back, neck and knee injuries and was unable to work for several 
months.  After falling behind in her bills, Applicant was unable to pay her debts and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1992.  By action of the bankruptcy court, 
her debts in the amount of approximately $21,000 were discharged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant met her husband in 1996.  In May 1999, Applicant gave birth, prematurely, to a baby girl, who died three days later.  In November 1999, Applicant 
lost her job when her employer lost its contract.  Her employer offered her another position in a neighboring State, but she declined to move her family and 
leave her mother, who was in ill health.  She returned to school, and the financial burdens of her two-earner household fell solely upon her husband.  In 
December 1999, Applicant's mother died.  Applicant reports that for the first 9 months or so of the year 2000, she was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">grieving and found it difficult to carry 
on.  To help her, her husband took over the family correspondence, bank accounts, finances, and bill paying.  (Answer, Personal Statement, at 1; Ex. 2, at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In August 2000, Applicant set about finding work again.  She joined the active reserves for the U.S. Navy.  In late January 2001, she was interviewed and 
subsequently offered a job with a government contractor.  She was directed to complete a security clearance application and to turn it in to her employer as soon 
as possible so that she could attend an orientation course for new employees.  When she completed and signed her security clearance application on February 
14, 2001, she was unaware of many of the debts attributed to her on her credit report.  When she was told by her new employer that a check of her credit status 
revealed unpaid debts and judgments, Applicant set about paying off her existing debts. She denies falsifying her SF-86 or failing to be candid about her 
financial status.  (Answer, Personal Statement, at 1.)  She denies falsifying her answers on the SF-86 with criminal intent.  (Tr. 41-42.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was interviewed by Defense Security Service agents about her financial problems  on May 29, 2002 and August 12, 2002.  In her signed, sworn 
statements, Applicant discussed her various debts and her progress in paying her creditors. (Ex. 2 and Ex. 3.)  The SOR issued by DOHA on February 5, 2003 
relied upon Applicant's signed sworn statement of May 29, 2002 and a Report of Credit dated August 6, 2002 to allege unpaid debts, judgments, and other 
unmet financial obligations.  At her hearing on July 10, 2003, and in her post-hearing submissions, Applicant presented persuasive evidence demonstrating that 
she had paid or settled the debts and financial liabilities alleged in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . .control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>. at 527.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to "United 
States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect;3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive, Enclosure 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore properly concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, or unreliability.  These concerns include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  In 
evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge must consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) 
the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Adjudicative Guidelines F, Financial Considerations (Attachment 6 to Enclosure 2), E, Personal Conduct (Attachment 5 to Enclosure 2), and J, Criminal 
Conduct (Attachment 10 to Enclosure 2) are most pertinent to this case.  The security concern identified under Guideline F is that a person who is financially 
overextended can be pressured to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Conditions that could raise a security concern in this case and which may be 
disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A6.1.2.1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A6.1.2.3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Relevant conditions that could mitigate security concerns about the Applicant's financial problems include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A6.1.3.1.  The behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A6.1.3.6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The relevant provisions of Guideline E which apply to the facts of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A5.1.1.  The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying is:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A5.1.2.2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the following conditions could mitigate security concerns :</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A5.1.3.1.  The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A5.1.3.5.  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The relevant provisions of Guideline J which apply to the facts of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A.10.1.1.  The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A.10.1.2.1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A.10.1.2.2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the following condition could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A10.1.3.4.  The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by an applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates 
security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts 
proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy 
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  In </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531, the Supreme Court concludes that "[t]he clearly 
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Accordingly, doubts against an applicant's 
security worthiness are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described above, I 
conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may  try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and, on its face, her 
financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1 and 
E2.A6.1.2.3 of Guideline F.  Applicant admitted the allegation at 1.a. of the SOR, that she had filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and that her debts of over $21,000 
had been discharged.  However, in her signed sworn statements of May 29, 2002 and August 12, 2002, in her answer to the SOR, and in her testimony and 
exhibits, Applicant provided persuasive evidence to show that she has taken charge of her financial life and has paid overdue accounts to creditors and resolved 
the debts and financial obligations alleged in the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Specifically, Applicant was able to show that she had paid or settled the debts or judgments  alleged at 1.b., 1.d, 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., 
1.p.,1.q., and 1.r. of the SOR.  She demonstrated that she had made agreements with the creditors to pay the debts alleged at 1.c and 1.l., totaling $1100, by the 
end of August 2003.  She demonstrated that allegation 1.j. of the SOR reflected a double charge, that the actual balance due had been paid in full in March 
2001, and that as of July 2003 the account balance was zero.  She also demonstrated that the unpaid judgment alleged at 1.i. of the SOR, in the amount of $130, 
and the unpaid judgment alleged at 1.k of the SOR, in the amount of $138, were likely duplicate debts for anesthesia services to a health care provider.  
Applicant provided evidence that she had paid one of the judgments in full and that the other was being investigated as a duplicate charge.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant persuasively demonstrated her financial problems had been caused in the past by conditions largely beyond her control and that her inability to meet 
her debts was not recent behavior, pursuant to mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.1 and E2.A6.1.3.3 of Guideline F.  She persuasively demonstrated that, pursuant 
to mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.6, she had initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or to otherwise resolve her debts. Accordingly, I find for 
Applicant on all 18 subparagraphs of the SOR relating to Guideline F, Financial Considerations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR also alleges that Applicant deliberately concealed or falsified relevant and material information about her financial indebtedness on her signed and 
certified SF-86, thus giving rise to allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  Applicant denied the allegations of 
concealment and deliberate falsification and stated that her failure to report her past financial obligations was an honest mistake and not pertinent to a 
determination of her judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR the Government alleged that, in executing her response to question 37 on the SF-86, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose 
the unpaid judgments alleged at subparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i of the SOR., thus raising a security concern under subparagraph E2.A8.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  In 
subparagraph 2.b. of the SOR the Government alleged that in executing her responses to questions 38 and 39 on the SF-86, the Applicant deliberately failed to 
list her financial delinquencies of over 180 days in the past seven years and current financial delinquencies of over 90 days, thus raising additional security 
concerns under subparagraph E2.A8.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  The Government further alleged in subparagraph 2.b(1) that Applicant's deliberate falsifications 
were identified in the allegations specified in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  In subparagraph 2.b(2) of the SOR the Government alleged that after completing her 
security clearance application, Applicant settled several accounts that she should have listed on her application.  Applicant asserts that she was unaware of the 
unpaid judgments recited in allegations 1.h and 1.I of the SOR and the financial delinquencies referenced in allegation 2.b. of the SOR.  In response to 
allegation 2.b(2), she acknowledges that after completing her SF-86, she obtained a copy of her credit report, learned of the judgments and delinquencies 
attributed to her, and set about paying her creditors as soon as possible by earning extra money through overtime work.  (Signed, sworn statement dated May 
29, 2002; Tr. 45-46.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In subparagraph 3.a. of the SOR the Government alleges under Guideline J that Applicant signed and certified her SF-86 knowing that she had made intentional 
false statements thereon.  Applicant denies signing and certifying her SF-86 with the knowledge that her responses were not true, complete, and correct to the 
best of her knowledge and belief.  (Tr. 41.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the conclusion of Applicant's testimony, the Government conceded her assertion that her failure to list judgements and delinquencies attributed to her on her 
credit report could be seen as an honest mistake and declined to pursue the SOR allegations related to Guidelines E and J.  (Tr. 57.) The extenuating 
circumstances offered by Applicant correspond to mitigating conditions E2.A5.1.3.1 and E2.A5.1.3.5 under Guideline E and subparagraph E2.A10.1.3.4. under 
Guideline J.  I find for Applicant on the four allegations in the SOR relating to Guideline E and the one allegation in the SOR relating to Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of evidence and under all of the Directive 
guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable under the facts of the case.  Under the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has 
successfully overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.</SPAN></P>
