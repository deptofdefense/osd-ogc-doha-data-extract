<P>Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a decision, dated June 29, 1999, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security
clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
January 20, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement),
Criterion E (Personal Conduct), and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).</P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR in which he indicated he did not wish to have a
hearing.  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.   A copy of the FORM was given
to Applicant, who did not submit a response to it.  The case was then assigned to the
Administrative Judge for disposition.</P>

<P>  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></P>

<P>The Administrative Judge found: (a) Applicant purchased and used of marijuana during the
period 1974-November 1997; (b) Applicant used cocaine about six times during the period
1993-1996; (c) Applicant was arrested on drug-related charges in 1974, 1983, and 1994, with
all the charges being later dropped or dismissed; (d) Applicant intentionally falsified a security
clearance form in April 1998 by denying he had ever been arrested or charged and denying that
he had ever used illegal drugs in the past; and (e) during an October 1998 interview by a
Special Agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant falsely denied that he had ever been
arrested or charged with a crime other than a 1992 arrest for driving under the influence.  The
Judge concluded Applicant's conduct warranted an adverse security clearance decision.</P>

<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's factual findings.  Rather,
Applicant asserts his past mistakes are not reason enough to deny him a security clearance. 
The Board construes Applicant's assertion as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Contrary to Applicant's assertion, Applicant's history of drug abuse and falsification provide a
rational basis for the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.  The federal
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted
access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). 
Security requirements include consideration of a person's judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness.  <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy</EM>, 284 F.2d 173,
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  A history of drug abuse raises questions
about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g., AFGE Local
1533 v. Cheney</EM>, 944 F.2d 503, 506 n.6 (9th Cir. 1991)(noting various ways that drug abuse
could pose security risks).  Persons who engage in deliberate acts of falsification in connection
with a security clearance application or investigation raise serious questions about their
suitability for a security clearance.  <EM>See Harrison v. McNamara</EM>, 228 F. Supp. 406, 408 (D.
Conn. 1964)(lying on application for government position requiring a security clearance raises
questions as to person's reliability and justifies dismissal), <EM>aff'd per curiam</EM>, 380 U.S. 261
(1965).  Given Applicant's history of drug abuse and falsification, the Judge's adverse
conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's June 29, 1999 decision.</P>
