<P>Applicant's history of alcohol abuse is not mitigated where it was punctuated by two alcohol-related incidents between November 1999 and October 2001, and 
where Applicant continues to drink. Falsification of his clearance application in April 2000 suggests he cannot be relied upon to disclose the truth if it conflicts 
with his personal interests. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 22 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-10077.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> recommending denial or revocation 
of Applicant's clearance.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record on 31 December 2003 and 21 January 2004. He 
responded to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 29 April 2004; the record in this case closed 17 June 2004, the day Department 
Counsel indicated no objection to the response. The case was assigned to me on 18 June 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the DWI arrests in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b., but otherwise denied the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's 
admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 43-year-old engineer for a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he has held since approximately 1985.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of alcohol abuse punctuated by two alcohol-related incidents. He continues to consume alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant describes his alcohol consumption as moderate, but he has had two convictions for DWI. In November 1999, he was stopped for DWI after being 
observed swerving between traffic lanes. He failed a field sobriety test and was cited for violating his state's implied consent law.<A HREF="03-10077.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He later pled guilty to DWI 
on the advice of retained counsel. In October 2001, Applicant was again stopped for DWI after being observed swerving between traffic lanes. He again pled 
guilty to DWI.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is also alleged to have had a third alcohol-related arrest in August 1995. However, the record contains no local agency records describing the 
incident, and Applicant has given two conflicting explanations for the event, neither one of which establishes that Applicant was operating a vehicle under the 
influence of alcohol.<A HREF="03-10077.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 6 August 2002, Applicant disclosed his October 2001 DWI, but failed to disclose his November 1999 DWI and his August 1995 summons.<A HREF="03-10077.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant 
denied falsifying his clearance application, claiming he got bad advice from his lawyer regarding the November 1999 charge. However, the court records from 
the 1999 arrest demonstrate the providency of his guilty pleas made with the advice of counsel.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's senior manager considers him an excellent worker who should have his clearance. He has neither observed nor received reports of any faulty 
workmanship that could be attributed to alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (GUIDELINE G)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1. The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and 
increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents 
related to alcohol use.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's two DWI convictions in 1999 and 2001 establish a history of alcohol abuse--without 
considering the August 1995 incident--that shifts the burden of persuasion to Applicant to demonstrate that he does not have a problem with alcohol. His 
evidence falls short of meeting that burden. Consequently, I conclude Guideline G against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's DWI convictions denote criminal involvement, thus establishing the Government case under Guideline J, the security significance of the 
incidents lies in demonstrating Applicant's substance abuse issues. I conclude Guideline J for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant certainly knew he had more than the one alcohol-related arrest he reported on his 
clearance application. His willingness to withhold that information from the Government suggests he may be willing to put his personal interests ahead of those 
of the Government. I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
