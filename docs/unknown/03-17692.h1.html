<P>Applicant was arrested for or charged with criminal conduct six times between 1983 and 1999. Also, he deliberately omitted information about his criminal 
conduct when he completed a security clearance application (SF 86) and when he was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent. He has 
failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On December 28, 2004, DOHA issued 
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR, admitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on February 16, 2005, and I convened a hearing March 25, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented 
seven exhibits (GE 1 through 7), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on April 7, 
2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>At hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. Specifically, the government requested that SOR &para; 2.b be changed to delete reference to Applicant's 
1999 arrest as also listed in SOR &para; 1.a. Without objection, I granted the motion.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 44 years old and employed as a technician for a defense contractor. He requires a security clearance as part of his job description, which includes 
physical access to DoD sites for cable installation projects.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1976 until 1999. During that time, he was arrested for possession of marijuana in 1999 (SOR &para; 
1.a), possession of marijuana in 1989 (SOR &para; 1.b), possession of a weapon and carrying prohibited narcotic equipment in 1985 (SOR &para; 1.d), and possession of 
marijuana in 1982 (SOR &para; 1.f). When he was arrested in 1999, rather than "rat" on a friend, Applicant lied to police by stating the very small amount of 
marijuana found in his car belonged to him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in January 2002. In response to question 24, which asked whether he had ever been charged with 
or convicted of any alcohol or drug-related offense, Applicant disclosed only his 1999 arrest. Applicant did not ask for help or advice before he submitted the 
SF 86. However, at or after the time he submitted the form, his boss asked him if he had told the truth. Applicant answered he had been truthful given his 
understanding he only had to go back seven years. His boss corrected Applicant and made clear Applicant was required to disclose his drug arrests even beyond 
seven years.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the background investigation conducted after he submitted his SF 86, agents from the Defense Security Service (DSS) interviewed Applicant three 
times. During the first interview in June 2002, Applicant described his use of marijuana and his 1999 arrest. In a follow-up interview in July 2002, Applicant 
discussed much of the same information, but also asserted he had "never had any other adverse contacts with law enforcement agencies."<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In his next interview 
in June 2003, Applicant stated he omitted his other arrests from his SF 86 and during his July 2002 interview because he thought he only had to disclose such 
adverse information if it had occurred in the preceding seven years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was arrested for carrying a weapon in 1985, the weapon in question was a night stick. There is no information in the record to the effect that he 
has ever been arrested for having a firearm. Nor is there any information in the government's documents identifying the weapon he was carrying when arrested. 
In response to SF 86 question 22, which asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms charge, Applicant answered "no."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1989, Applicant was charged with contempt of court after he failed to appear in court pursuant to a moving violation (SOR &para; 1.c). Applicant had 
also been charged with the same offense in April 1981 (SOR &para; 1.g). In 1983, Applicant was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, driving on a 
suspended license, and careless driving. He was eventually fined $500 (SOR &para; 1.e).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears he deliberately falsified his SF 86 and a statement he gave to DSS 
during one of his subject interviews. SOR 2.a alleges he deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 question 22 regarding firearms charges. However, other than 
Applicant's testimony, there is no available information about the weapon in question. I conclude the government has failed to establish the allegation in SOR &para; 
2.a. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the remaining allegations in SOR 2.b and 2.c, the government has established that Applicant deliberately omitted from his SF 86 and his second DSS 
interview his drug-related arrests from 1989, 1985, and 1982. Applicant insists he thought the scope of question 24 was limited to the preceding seven years; 
however, I conclude from the weight of all the available information about Applicant's truthfulness that Applicant intended to mislead the government about 
these incidents. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, after he submitted his SF 86, but before his first DSS interview, his boss told him the scope went beyond seven years to include any drug or 
alcohol-related offenses in his past. Nonetheless, when Applicant was interviewed by DSS a second time about his drug use and arrest record, Applicant denied 
having been arrested at any time other than the 1999 arrest alleged in SOR &para; 1.a. Further, Applicant lied to the police about whose drugs were in his car when 
he was arrested in 1999. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While it may be understandable that Applicant did not understand the SF 86 questions, once his boss clarified the scope of the inquiries, Applicant could not 
then use the same rationale to withhold the information during his DSS interview. I conclude Applicant deliberately attempted to mislead the government about 
the true extent of his arrest record in both his SF 86 and during his interview with DSS. In light of the foregoing, Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
and DC 3<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. By contrast, Applicant's Answer and hearing testimony are not sufficient to support application of any of the listed mitigating conditions 
(MC) under Guideline E. I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct, as addressed under Guideline J, is a security concern because it may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, and may 
show the applicant to be lacking in reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government has established through record evidence and Applicant's own 
admissions that Applicant was arrested for or charged with various minor criminal offenses between 1981 and 1999. Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's criminal conduct was generally related to his drug use, which ceased in 1999. The absence of any recent similar conduct,<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> combined 
with Applicant's more stable lifestyle, supports Application of Guideline J mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 6.<A HREF="03-17692.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Based on available information about Applicant's 
unwillingness to fully disclose information about his arrest record, reasonable doubts persist about his ability to protect classified information and to exercise 
the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Given the record before me, I conclude Applicant has 
not overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
