<P>Applicant's falsification of his clearance application and financial irresponsibility renders him an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 7 June 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his 
clearance because of financial consideration and personal conduct.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 27 June 2005 and requested a decision on the record. He 
did not respond to DOHA's 30 August 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). DOHA assigned the case to me 28 October 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR except for 1.e.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and the falsification allegations except for 1.a.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>; accordingly, I incorporate his 
admissions as findings of fact.  He is a 53-year-old mail services supervisor employed by a defense contractor since January 1988. He seeks to retain the 
clearance he has held since approximately April 1989.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to at least 1997. He filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in December 1997.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The plan was 
ultimately confirmed and Applicant appears to have made about six (of 60) payments before defaulting. The chapter 13 was later dismissed, then re-instated and 
converted to a chapter 7 filing. Applicant was discharged from nearly $15,000.00 debt in July 1999. The relief was short lived.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges--and Applicant's admissions and the government's evidence establishes--eight delinquent debts totaling over $13,000.00, all of which 
became delinquent between May 1999 and January 2005.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> His debts include deficiency amounts for a repossessed automobile, collection accounts, and charge-off/bad debt accounts. None of the delinquent accounts have been paid off despite a February 2004 personal financial statement showing positive cash flow of 
$375 per month. While the bulk of his debt ($11,300.00) is from three accounts that are each more than $1,000.00, the remaining five are less than $1,000.00. 
Three of those are less than $400.00 each; one unpaid collection account is $26.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence that Applicant contacted any of his creditors about his delinquent accounts, or that he has sought any kind of financial counseling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his clearance application in September 2002, he answered "no" to every question requiring him to disclose certain aspects of his 
financial situation. He failed to disclose his 1999 chapter 7 discharge and his 1999 unpaid judgment.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline F case, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect over $13,000.00 of delinquent 
debt acquired after Applicant's bankruptcy discharge in 1999.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He has offered no credible explanation of how his finances deteriorated so quickly after his 
discharge. He offers no explanation why he has undertaken no repayment efforts, despite the apparent ability to do so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and not isolated;<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> indeed they appear to be 
ongoing. Applicant has not demonstrated that his continuing financial difficulties are due to circumstances beyond his control.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> There is no evidence that he 
has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Finally, he has made no effort to contact his creditors to arrange repayment 
schedules for his debts,  despite having the apparent means to do so.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his 1999 bankruptcy and his 
1999 unpaid judgment.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> To examine his clearance application, you would not know he had ongoing financial problems. Further, none of the Guideline E 
mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was relevant to a clearance decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the falsifications were isolated, they were recent, and 
there is no evidence demonstrating that Applicant provided the correct information voluntarily.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> There is no evidence demonstrating that he corrected the 
falsification before being asked about it.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence to suggest that Applicant received bad advice about what he was required to disclose on his 
clearance application.<A HREF="04-08855.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant denied this debt, asserting that the account should be his ex-wife's responsibility. However, the credit reports on file show this to be an individual 
account in Applicant's name only. Applicant has provided no divorce decree or property settlement allocating this account to his ex-wife. Applicant also 
acknowledged responsibility for this account in his February 2004 sworn statement. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant denied deliberately omitting his 1997-1999 bankruptcy proceeding from his clearance application, asserting that he thought the filing was more 
than seven years before applying for a clearance. This claim is not credible. Applicant did not offer this explanation in his February 2004 sworn statement. He 
raised if for the first time in his answer to the SOR. Further, the chapter 13 petition filed by Applicant in December 1997 was an individual petition in 
Applicant's name only, that was later dismissed for failure to make required payments, and ultimately converted to a chapter 7 petition. Applicant's discharge in 
bankruptcy was in July 1999--only slightly more than three years before Applicant's clearance application.  
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Applicant's stated timelines and explanations are inconsistent. Although his sworn statement attributes the financial problems to his divorce, his clearance 
application state that he and his wife did not separate until June 2000, nearly a year after his chapter 7 discharge. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>The May 1999 debt (1.b.) is for a judgment obtained by Applicant's dentist that was not included in Applicant's bankruptcy filing. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>Although not alleged in the SOR, he also failed to disclose the delinquent debts reported at 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e., each of which had been charged off as a bad 
debt or referred for collection before Applicant completed his clearance application.
