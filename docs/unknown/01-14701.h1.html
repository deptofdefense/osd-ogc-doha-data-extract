<P>Applicant's excessive indebtedness has been mitigated.  His deliberate falsifications on two security clearance applications concerning his arrest history and 
illegal drug use has not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On February 12, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 1, 2002, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on July 8, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 15, 2002.  The hearing was held on August 2, 2002, at which the Government 
presented thirteen exhibits.  The Applicant presented six exhibits.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
August 12, 2002.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 34 years old, and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a truck driver, and is seeking to retain his Secret 
security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on August 24, 2000.  (See, Applicant's Exhibit F).  Each of the debts listed in the Statement of Reasons were 
discharged on November 29, 2000.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1(a)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of approximately $2,922.00 for an account delinquent 
since August 26, 1999.  The Applicant stated that he is uncertain as to the specific amount he owed to the creditor.  However, the debt was discharged in his 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 2000. (Applicant's Exhibit F).        </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1(b)</SPAN>  The Applicant admits that he was indebted to a hospital in the amount of $122.00 for an account delinquent since August 26, 1999.  
However, the debt was discharged in  his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 2000.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).        </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1&copy;)</SPAN>  The Applicant admits that he was indebted to a hospital in the amount of approximately $162.00 for an account delinquent since August 26, 
1999.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, the debt was discharged in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 2000.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).       </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1(d)</SPAN>  The Applicant admits that he was indebted to a hospital in the amount of approximately $135.00 for a account delinquent since August 26, 
1999.  However, the debt was discharged in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 2000.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1(e)</SPAN>  The Applicant admits that he was indebted to a hospital in the amount of $397.00 for an account delinquent since August 26, 1999.  
However, the debt was discharged in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 2000.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Subparagraph 1(f)</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Government alleges that on October 13, 1993, a civil judgment was entered against the Applicant in the amount of approximately 
$1,000.00.  The Applicant states that he has no knowledge of this judgment, but contends that it was discharged in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29, 
2000.  (Applicant's Exhibit F).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (DD form 398-2) dated March 7, 1995.  In response to question 18, which asked, "Have you ever 
been arrested, charged, cited, held, or detained by Federal, State, or other law enforcement or juvenile authorities regardless of whether the charge was dropped 
or dismissed or you were found guilty?" the Applicant listed his arrest in 1991 for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  He failed to disclose his arrest in 
January 1991, for Public Intoxication, Disturbing the Peace and Resisting Arrest; in June 1991 for Public Intoxication; in January 1994 for Buy/Sell Articles 
with ID removed, Impact Wrench; and in February 1994, for Use/Under Influence of Controlled Substance.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 2,Question 18).  The 
Applicant stated that to his knowledge he did not complete an "SF 86" on March 7, 1995.  Question 18, on the security clearance application he had refers to 
"Selective Service Record."  (See, Government Exhibit 3).  After being provided a copy of his National Agency Questionnaire he still did not remember it, but 
acknowledged that his signature appears to be on the document.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated June 30, 1999.  In response to question 24, which asked, "Have you ever 
been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?" the Applicant listed his arrest in 1991 for Driving Under the Influence.  He failed 
to disclose his arrest in January 1991, for Public Intoxication, Disturbing the Peace and Resisting Arrest; in June 1991, for Public Intoxication; and in February 
1994, for Use/Under Influence of Controlled Substance.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 3, Question 24)     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire, in question 26, asked, "In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses(s) not listed in 
modules 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25."  The Applicant answered "NO" to this question.  This was a false response.  The Applicant failed to list his arrest in January 
1994 for Buy/Sell Articles with ID removed, Impact Wrench.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 3, Question 26).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same application in response to question 27, asked, "Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, which ever is shorter, have you illegally used a controlled 
substance or prescription drugs?"  The Applicant answered "NO" to this question.  This was a false response.  The Applicant failed to disclose his use of speed 
from 1993 to February 1994.  The Applicant stated that he did not know the dates that he used speed.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 3, Question 27). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There was some initial confusion in the record with respect to whether the Applicant intentionally falsified his security questionnaires concerning his arrest 
history and illegal drug use.  The Applicant first testified that he denied the allegations in answering the Statement of Reasons, because he did not have 
Government Exhibit 2, but thought questions were being asked about Government Exhibit 3.  (See, Tr. p. 42 and Applicant's Response to SOR).  (It is also 
noted, that each allegation set forth under Guideline E, paragraph 2, of the Statement of Reasons was erroneously alleged in some fashion.  Either the title of the 
document was alleged wrong, or the date of the incident was alleged wrong.  The Government moved to amend these allegations at the hearing to comply with 
the evidence presented.  Even so, this does not explain why the Applicant did not answer the questions on his security clearance applications truthfully in the 
first place).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant further testified that at the time he filled out his security clearance application in 1999, he had forgotten specific dates and times and was not sure 
how far to go back in answering some of the questions.  He states that he honestly thought that he had resolved the matter when he was able to clarify these 
details during his interview with the Defense Security Service (DSS).  The Applicant stated that at no time did he deliberately attempt to conceal his arrests or 
his past illegal drug use, he simply did not remember dates and times until his interview with DSS.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government concedes that when the Applicant met with the DSS, he voluntarily provided all of the information concerning his arrests and drug use in 
detail.  (Applicant's Exhibit E). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation from the Applicant's Lead, a coworker, his apartment manager and the man that hired him, indicate that the Applicant is reliable, 
trustworthy, dedicated to his job and an asset to his company.  (See, Applicant's Exhibits A, B, C, and D).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6. The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or statute, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant was, in the past, financially irresponsible (Guideline F); and he intentionally 
falsified material facts in his security clearance application (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the 
part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance 
eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to his finances, the Applicant has filed bankruptcy, his debts were discharged and he has resolved his indebtedness.  He and his wife are current 
with all of their bills and plan to stay that way.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even considering the fact that the Applicant was confused about the time and dates that his arrests and drug use occurred, he knew that he had been arrested and 
that he has used speed and he should have revealed those matters in response to the questions on his security clearance applications.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, I do not find his excuses credible or believable.  I have been provided no reasonable excuse for the 
Applicant to have failed to reveal his arrest history and illegal drug involvement.  Consequently, the evidence proves that the Applicant has not been completely 
honest with the Government regarding his arrest history and illegal drug involvement.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to 
the Government. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant 
has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal background.  This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and 
does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has not provided this Administrative Judge with sufficient evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact his falsifications have on 
his security worthiness.  At this time, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant the Applicant a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  As stated above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant. </SPAN></P>
