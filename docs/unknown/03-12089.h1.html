<P>Applicant used marijuana and cocaine on various occasions from 1987 to March 2002. Applicant used cocaine and marijuana after being granted a security 
clearance in 1999.  Concerns about her illegal drug use have been mitigated by the absence of illegal drug use in over four years and her assurances that she 
does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future.  However, her deliberate pattern of minimizing her drug use on two security clearance applications and in a 
signed, sworn statement provided during her background investigation is not mitigated and raises security concerns about her judgment and reliability. Security 
concerns based on personal conduct and criminal conduct are not mitigated. Clearance is denied.</P>

1.a and 1.c and all allegations under Guideline E and Guideline J. Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, 
after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 34-year-old project control/subcontracts administrator for a defense contractor.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  She received a SECRET clearance in 1999 while employed as a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 28, 1999, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Question 27 of the application reads:  <STRONG>"Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug 
Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs. </STRONG>Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, 
marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbituates, methaqualone, 
tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?"  She answered "No" to that question.  She did not list the illegal drugs she used 
within 7 years of filling out her security clearance application.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 20, 2002, Applicant submitted another security clearance application.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She answered "Yes" in response to question 27.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She indicated that she had 
used marijuana on at least eight occasions from 1996 to present and had used cocaine once in July 2000.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No" to question 28. <STRONG>"Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions. </STRONG> Have you EVER illegally used a 
controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a 
position directly and immediately affecting public safety?"  She did not mention her use of cocaine and marijuana while holding a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 9, 2002, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She indicated that her first use of 
marijuana occurred in the fall of 1987 while in high school.  Between 1987 and June 1989, she smoked marijuana about twice a month.  From September 1989 
to June 1990, she smoked marijuana about ten times.  From 1990 to 1995, she smoked marijuana on average about twice a year.  She smoked marijuana on one 
occasion between 1995 and 1996.  She used marijuana once in 1999.  Her last use of marijuana was in September 2001.  She indicated that she used cocaine on 
three occasions between the summer of 1989 to June/July 2001.  She also used LSD once while in high school.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

In this statement, she indicated  that she had snorted cocaine on six occasions. In the summer of 1989 she used cocaine two times on the same day.  In the fall of 
1989, she used cocaine once.  In the summer of 2001, she used cocaine on two occasions. On one occasion she used cocaine twice on the same day.  She used 
cocaine once on the other occasion.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> She also listed marijuana use as follows:  from 1987 to 1992, once or twice a month; from 1992 to 1996 about ten times; 
one time between 1996 to 1998; once in 1999; once in 2000; and anywhere between five to ten times to as much as 15 times in the summer of 2001.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> She 
purchased a small amount of marijuana on two occasions while in high school for her personal use.  Her drug use occurred in social situations.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted to providing false information on her June 28, 1999, security clearance application in response to question 27 regarding her illegal drug use 
because she believed she would not get a security clearance if she told the truth.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> She also minimized her illegal drug use in response to question 27 on her

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She claims she answered "No" to question 28 on her March 21, 2002, security clearance application because she did not recall having a security clearance when

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When I was interviewed on 9 Apr 02 by Defense Security Service, I purposefully minimized the amount and frequency of my marijuana and cocaine use.  I 
believed that if I told the truth, I would not get my security clearance.  I had recalled almost all of my drug use during the interview but decided to admit only a 
portion of it to increase my chances of getting cleared. I also provided false information concerning my drug use in the sworn statement I gave during that 
interview, by not disclosing all of it.<A HREF="03-12089.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position … that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(<EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).)  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H - Drug Involvement:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.(Directive &para; E2.A8.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E - Personal Conduct:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. (Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
(<EM>Id.</EM>) <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.15.)  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines H, Drug Involvement; E, Personal Conduct; and J, Criminal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While not a habitual user, Applicant used illegal drugs (cocaine, marijuana) on various occasions between 1987 to October 2001. On two occasions while in 
high school, Applicant purchased marijuana for her own personal use.  On other occasions, Applicant used illegal drugs while in social situations.  Under the 
Drug Involvement Guideline, Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1: (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM>) applies as well as DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2: (<EM>Illegal drug possession, 
including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.</EM>) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns based on possession and use of illegal drugs can be mitigated.  I find that Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1: (<EM>The 
drug involvement was not recent</EM>) and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future) </EM>applies.  Applicant has not used illegal 
drugs since October 2001. She married in October 2003 and is expecting her first child.  She no longer associates with people who use illegal drugs. Her 
priorities have changed. The security concerns raised by Applicant's use of illegal drugs are mitigated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's deliberate falsification of her security clearance applications submitted on June 28, 1999, and March 20, 2002, supports the application of Personal 
Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).</EM>  Applicant admitted in her February 3, 2005, 
signed, sworn statement that she minimized her drug use out of concern that she might not get a security clearance.  She denied using any illegal drugs within 
seven years of submitting her June 28, 1999, security clearance application.  She minimized the extent her illegal drug use in her March 20, 2002, security 
clearance application. Although she denied intentionally falsifying her security clearance applications during the hearing, I find her February 3, 2005, signed, 
sworn statement to be more credible than her testimony during the hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3: (<EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, 
competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personal security or trustworthiness determination</EM>)<EM> </EM>applies with respect to 
Applicant's deliberate minimization of the extent of her illegal drug use in her  signed, sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service on April 9, 
2002.  She admitted in her February 3, 2005, signed, sworn statement that she minimized the extent of her illegal drug use in her April 2002 statement in order 
to increase her chances of getting a security clearance.  I find her actions were deliberate and the information about her illegal drug use was relevant and 
material.  As such, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), only PC MC  E2.A5.1.3.3: (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
falsification before being confronted with the facts) </EM>has the potential to apply to the facts of this case. I find that it does not apply.  Applicant deliberately 
falsified two security clearance applications and one signed, sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service before she admitted to minimizing her 
illegal drug use. She  first deliberately provided false information in June 1999.  She subsequently provided false information about her illegal drug use in 
arch 2002 and April 2002. Applicant did not provide an accurate assessment of her illegal drug use until February 5, 2005.  I cannot conclude her final 
disclosures were prompt.  As such PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 does not apply. I conclude the personal conduct security concern is not mitigated. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's deliberate falsifications on two different security clearance applications and in a signed, sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service 
during her background investigation, violates Title 18, United States Code Section 1001, a felony.   A such, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC 
DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant's deliberate falsifications occurred during a current background investigation, as such her criminal conduct 
is recent.  Since she falsified two different security clearance applications and one signed, sworn statement, her criminal conduct cannot be described as an 
isolated incident. Applicant maintained her deliberate deceptions pertaining to her drug use over a five-year period.  Considering she did not fully disclose the 
extent of her drug use until February 2005, I find that not enough time has passed to establish clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  The security concern 
raised by Applicant's criminal conduct is not mitigated. </SPAN></P>
