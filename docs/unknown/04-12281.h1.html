<P>Applicant admitted using marijuana three or four times a year for seven to ten years.  He intentionally did not disclose his marijuana use and a bankruptcy on 
his security clearance application (SF 86).  Security concerns based on personal conduct and drug involvement are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to 
not grant a security clearance to Applicant.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and H (Drug Involvement).  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2005, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant admitted using 
marijuana three or four times a year for several years (SOR &para;&para; 1.b.(1), 1.c.(1), and 2.a.).  He admitted failing to disclose an alcohol-related arrest and a drug-related arrest on his SF 86 (SOR &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.c.) but offered explanations. He admitted failing to disclose his marijuana use and a bankruptcy (SOR &para;&para; 1.c. and 
1.d.).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on January 9, 2006.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to 
Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant 
received the FORM on January 12, 2006, but he did not respond.  The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 42-year-old financial analyst working for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his present employer since November 1993.  He received a 
clearance in December 1993.  He served in the U.S. Navy from September 1985 to September 1989, attaining the rate of petty officer second class (E-4).<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 14, 2003, Applicant executed a SF 86.  He answered "no" to question 24, asking if he had ever been charged with any offenses related to alcohol or 
drugs.  He failed to disclose an arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in August 1982 and an arrest for possession of marijuana in July 1998.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In a signed 
and sworn statement on September 25, 2003, he told a security investigator he did not think he was required to list the two arrests.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In his answer to the SOR, 
he  explained that he did not disclose the DWI because it was more than 10 years old, and he did not disclose the arrest for possession of marijuana because he 
was sentenced to community service and told the arrest would be expunged from the records.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the same SF 86, Applicant answered "no" to questions 27 and 28 pertaining to illegal use of drugs.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In his signed and sworn statement to the security 
investigator, he admitted his failure to disclose his use of marijuana, explaining he "didn't want anyone to know about it."<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant answered "no" to question 33 on his SF 86, asking if he had filed a bankruptcy petition in the last seven years.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In his statement to the 
security investigator as well as his answer to the SOR, he admitted filing for bankruptcy in September 1999, but he offered no explanation for not disclosing it 
on his SF 86.<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his interview with the security investigator, Applicant expressed his reluctance to give up his longtime marijuana-smoking friends, but he promised he would 
"attempt to stay away from settings where any illegal substances are being used."<A HREF="04-12281.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted failing to disclose his arrests for DWI and marijuana possession, but asserted he did not think he was required to disclose them on his SF 86.  
When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not prove an 
applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is 
direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 
17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).  Applicant's explanation for his negative answer to question 24 on his 
SF 86 is plausible.  I resolve SOR &para; 1.a. in his favor.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions that he intentionally omitted facts regarding his marijuana use and bankruptcy petition from his SF 86 prove the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 
1.b. and 1.c. and establish DC 2, shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant has the 
burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 
22, 2005).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant to this case.  MC 2 applies when the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  MC 3 applies when the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  Neither condition is established.  Applicant's falsifications were recent, 
involving his current application for continuance of his clearance, and he did not make any effort to correct the falsification until he was questioned by a 
security investigator.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the disqualifying conditions and the absence of mitigating conditions, and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on falsification of his security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under this guideline, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified 
information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Any illegal use of a controlled substance can raise a security concern and may be a disqualifying condition (DC 1).  
Directive &para; E2.A8.2.1.  Illegal drug possession also is a disqualifying condition (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A8.2.2.  DC 1 and DC 2 are established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns based on possession and use of marijuana can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent (MC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.3.1.  There are no 
"bright line" rules for determining when conduct is "recent."  The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the record.  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 
at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge 
must determine whether that period of time demonstrates "changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation."  <EM>Id</EM>.  
Applicant told a security investigator he used marijuana three or four times a year for a period of seven to ten years.  He also told the investigator he last used 
marijuana in February 2003, shortly before he executed his SF 86.  Since that time, he has been under the pressure of maintaining his clearance, but there is no 
evidence he has completed a drug rehabilitation program or made any significant lifestyle changes.  He is unwilling to abandon his marijuana-smoking friends.  
The most he has promised is to "attempt to stay away from settings where any illegal substances are being used."  Three years without using marijuana is a 
"significant period of time" in the abstract, but it is less significant in the context of seven to ten years of regular marijuana use and Applicant's reluctance to 
distance himself from his marijuana-using friends.  I conclude MC 1 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2 applies if "drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event."  Directive E2.A8.1.3.2.  Applicant's marijuana use was neither isolated nor 
aberrational.  I conclude MC 2 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 applies if there is "demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future."  Applicant stated his intent to stop using marijuana in his interview with the 
security investigator.  For the reasons stated above under the discussion of MC 1, I am not satisfied he has demonstrated his intent by a track record of changed 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the absence of mitigating circumstances and evaluating all the evidence under the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on drug involvement.</SPAN></P>
