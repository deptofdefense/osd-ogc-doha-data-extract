  Applicant is a 43 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People's Republic of China.  Applicant's father, brother and in-laws reside in the People's Republic of China. The evidence establishes that Applicant has extremely limited and infrequent contacts with his family, none of whom are  involved with the Chinese government.  He is not vulnerable to foreign influence because of his strong attachment to the United States and because his family is  not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People's Republic of China.  Applicant's father, brother and in-laws  reside in the 
People's Republic of China. The evidence establishes that Applicant has extremely limited and infrequent contacts with his family, none of whom are involved

position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> By

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 15, 2003. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 5, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on May 6, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to me 
to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 7, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 20, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibit 
and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on June 2, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress. </SPAN>In his response to the 
SOR, Applicant admits all five allegations. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor. He </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in the People's Republic of China in 1961, moved to the United States in 1989, and 
became a naturalized United States citizen in 1999. He received a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from a United States university in 1991. His wife is a 
Chinese born, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen, who became naturalized in 1999. Applicant and his wife have one 16 year old daughter, who also became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 1999.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father, brother, father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in the People's Republic of China</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. (Transcript at 32-33.) Applicant 
traveled to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> on four occasions between 1995 and 2002 to visit his father and brother. (Transcript at 33.) Applicant's only contact 
with his father is by letter approximately three or four times a year. Applicant telephones his brother two times a year and exchanges emails with him two or 
three times a year. While his wife has some contact with her parents he does not have any contact. (Transcript at 33, 34.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father has been retired for approximately eight or nine years, after working his entire adult career for a local railroad in China.(Transcript at 40.) 
Applicant's brother</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> works as a professor for a university, and he has never worked for the Chinese government. Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">father-in-law</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> worked as a research 
engineer, but has been retired for approximately 17 to 20 years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">father-in-law</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> received his Ph.D. in the United States, and because of that fact, he was always treated as a United States spy by the 
Chinese government. "That is part of the reason my wife and I decided to stay here instead of in China." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 41, 42.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that one of his dreams was to serve as part of the reserve military in the United States. He contacted the Air Force Reserve in 1995, to 
attempt to enlist but was informed that since he was over 35 years of age he was ineligible. He also stated that he has voted in every election since he became a 
naturalized United States citizen. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 44.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he was questioned as to what he would do if the Chinese Government threatened  his family, if he did not cooperate with the government, he testified, "I 
would feel very painful but I would say no, never.  I'm sure it is going to be a very difficult decision for me, but I would not hesitate, I would never 
compromise." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 45.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He was also questioned as to what he would do if he were contacted by representatives of the People's Republic of China.  
"Of course I'm going to report to my security officer, and also if they contact me I would be very careful in how to deal with them not compromise any security 
information. If they have any requests I would turn them down and report it." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 46-47.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FOREIGN INFLUENCE</SPAN> (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's 
immediate family members including his father, brother and in-laws are citizens of and reside in the People's Republic of China. The Chinese citizenship and 
residency of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information 
because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to 
require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>The evidence of existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the People's Republic of China</SPAN> comes within Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) 1.  However, based on the nature of the overall record, including: the lack of government involvement of Applicant's family members, the fact 
that his father and in-laws are elderly and have long been retired, his brother is not employed as a professor by a private university, Applicant's family history 
since coming to the United States and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his extremely strong testimony about his feelings concerning the United States</SPAN> and what he would do if faced with a 
threat from a foreign government, I have determined that his family members do not constitute an unacceptable security risk and Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1 
applies.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, based on his extremely limited and infrequent contacts with his father, brother and in-laws, MC 3 also applies to this case. Guideline B is 
found for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P>
