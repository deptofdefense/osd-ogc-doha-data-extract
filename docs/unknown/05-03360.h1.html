<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old executive for a defense contractor.  Prior to 1983, he had extra-marital affairs which he divulged to his wife in 1999 while in marriage counseling.  In 2002, he was convicted 
of driving under the influence of alcohol.  In 2004, after drinking alcohol, he sexual harassed a female employee.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for sexual behavior and alcohol 
consumption.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 29, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 12, 2005.  The SOR alleges security concerns under 
Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), and Guideline D (sexual behavior) of the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2005.  He admitted all of the allegations under Guidelines E, G, and J, but provided an explanation for his actions.  He elected to have the matter 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on July 31, 2006.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 6, 2006, and was provided the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant provided additional information on October 26, 2006. On October 31, 2006, 
Department Counsel noted no objection to consideration of the additional material.  The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant admitted the facts associated with the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old executive for a government contractor for the last eight months.  Before that time, and when the security clearance application was submitted, Applicant worked for another 
defense contractor for over six years.  He held a security clearance, to include sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access, for over ten years.  He is a college graduate, married, with two children.  
Applicant signed a security clearance application  on October 16, 2003.  In response to question 21 asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense, Applicant listed a 2002 
driving while intoxicated offense (DWI).  In response to question 19 asking if in the last seven years he consulted a mental health professional, Applicant acknowledge seeing a mental health doctor for 
marital-related problems.  In response to question 30 asking if in the last seven years his use of alcohol resulted in alcohol-related treatment or counseling, Applicant listed medical treatment and 
counseling in 2002-2003.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In June 2002, Applicant played in a golf tournament and consumed six to eight beers.  On his way home, he was stopped by police for DWI.  He pled guilty to the offense, and was sentenced to 
probation before judgment, fined, placed on probation for 90 days, and required to attend alcohol counseling.  He completed all aspects of his sentence.  As part of his sentence, he attended an alcohol 
counseling program from June 2002 to April 2003.  He was diagnosed as a "problem drinker", but not considered an "alcoholic."  He states he still drinks a beer or two a week but does not drive after 
drinking.  He was not recommended for further alcohol counseling.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In February 2004, Applicant was on an authorized business trip with female employees, A and B.  Applicant consumed about five drinks with the females while at dinner and a jazz club.  On return, 
they went to the hotel room of female A.  Shortly after, female B left.  Applicant laid on the bed and started sexually touching female A.  Female A objected, Applicant stopped, and left the room.  After 
returning from the trip, female A reported the incident to Applicant's supervisors.  The company took immediate action.  He was issued a formal reprimand, forfeited a sizable performance bonus, 
placed on probation within the company for six months, and directed to attend sexual behavior counseling.  Applicant consulted the same counselor that counseled him on his 2002 DWI incident.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not reported the sexual harassment incident to his wife.  Prior to 1983, Applicant had numerous extra-marital affairs that he reported to his wife in 1999 during marriage counseling.  His 
wife was anguished when she learned of these affairs.  He does not want to tell her of the 2004 sexual harassment incident so she does not experience the anguish again.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant related in his response to the SOR that since February 2004, he has been treated for sleep apnea.  His doctor informed him that he probably had the condition since the early 1980s.  He 
believes the June 2002 DWI and the February 2004 sexual behavior event were a result of his sleep apnea condition.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The medical literature provided by Applicant shows the results of sleep apnea are 
falling asleep inappropriately, morning headaches, memory problems, feelings of depression, reflux, and frequent need to urinate during the night.  The condition may result in job impairment and motor 
vehicle accidents.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  His medical doctor stated he has treated Applicant for sleep apnea since 2004.  His disease is chronic and is associated with poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, decrease in 
daytime alertness, and poor work performance.  Applicant has followed the prescribed medical routine and is one of the doctor's most successful patients.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant states in his response to the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Although the record as documented in the SOR is shameful, I believe I am a good and honorable man who is worthy of a security clearance.  I have worked hard all of my life and have accomplished 
much both professionally and personally of which I am proud.  However, I have on occasion done terribly stupid, thoughtless, and irresponsible things.  And I have spent a lot of time and energy to 
figure out why this paradoxical behavior has happened.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In his response to the FORM, Applicant notes:</P> 
 
<P>I have long recognized that alcohol abuse has been a problem for me and has had a tremendous impact on my life.. . . In fact, dealing with this Case for the past two years has reinforced my 
understanding of the need to get control over this problem so that it never has an adverse impact on my life.  </P> 
 
<P>He further relates that he maintained sobriety for 14 months.  He and his wife are still married and recently went on a cruise with others.  He has a new position with another defense contractor.  His 
brother was in an automobile accident and Applicant handled the stress of his brothers's injuries and decision making as his medical next of kin.  His son was married in May 2006.  Through all of these 
events, he has maintained his sobriety.   He has also continued with his sleep apnea procedures.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Chief Executive Officer of Applicant's prior  defense contractor employer until December 2005 stated he has known Applicant for over five years and believes him to be a decent, trustworthy, 
reliable, and honest man.  The incidents in the SOR are not indicative of Applicant's general character.  He believes Applicant is worthy of a security clearance.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His present employer in response to 
the FORM notes that Applicant is a thoughtful, focused individual with balanced thinking and consideration.  He is dedicated to his family and balances work and family life.  He is considered a solid 
professional and citizen.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give 
that person access to such information."<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to 
classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</P> 
 
<P>The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative judge must 
apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  It is merely 
an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  
Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative 
Judge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condidtion.<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>"[T]he 
Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  "Any doubt as to whether access to 
classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="05-03360.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline D - Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or 
reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline G - Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information due to carelessness.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in 
the conclusions section below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</P> 
 
<P>The government raises security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) because of Applicant's sexual harassment of a female employee in 2004, his extra marital affairs prior to 1983, and his 
refusal to tell his wife of the 2004 sexual harassment incident.  Applicant's admission to these actions establishes Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (<EM>reliable, unfavorable 
information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>); DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>personal conduct or concealment of information that increases and individual's 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities, which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible 
to blackmail</EM>; and DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between and individual and the agency</EM>).  Applicant's 
conduct in engaging in extra-marital affairs and his sexual harassment of a female employee is unfavorable information concerning him, and shows a pattern of dishonesty.  His refusal to tell his wife 
about the sexual harassment because of concern for her feelings increases his vulnerability to coercion or exploitation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raises, by his responses to the SOR and FORM, Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A5.1.3.1 (<EM>the information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of 
judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability; </EM>and MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>).  Applicant 
admitted to the facts so the information is substantiated.  Even though the extra-marital affairs happened more than 20 years ago, they are still pertinent to a determination as to his judgment, 
trustworthiness, or reliability.  The sexual harassment happened only two years ago and shows a course of conduct similar to the extra-marital affairs.  His proclivity to engage in extra marital affairs 
shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.  Even though he has not told his wife about the sexual harassment incident, his explanation that he wants to spare her the anguish is 
reasonable.  While telling her about the incident will help him, it may be difficult for her because of her prior feelings from his previous disclosure.  His failure to tell her under the circumstances does 
not make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  I find against Applicant as to the security concerns for personal conduct since the extra-marital affairs and the sexual harassment incident 
are similar conduct and show a continued security concern.</P> 
 
<P>The government raises security concerns under Guideline D (sexual behavior) because of extra marital affairs and Applicant's sexual harassment of a female employee.  Applicant's admission to the 
extra-marital affairs and sexual harassment allegations raises Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A4.1.2.1 (<EM>sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been 
prosecuted</EM>); DC E2.A4.1.2.3 (<EM>sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>); and DC E2.A4.1.2.4 (<EM>sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which 
reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM>).  Applicant's admission that he engaged in numerous extra-marital affairs prior to 1983 and to sexually harassing one of his female employees while on a business 
trip in 2004 establishes the disqualifying conditions.  The sexual harassment incident is a criminal offense of at least assault.  The extra-marital affairs and the sexual harassment of an employee are 
sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment because they both violated the marital trust.  The sexual harassment of an employee causes difficult workplace problems and demonstrates a 
significant lack of judgment by a person in Applicant's position in a company.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's responses to the SOR and FORM raise Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A4.1.3.2 (<EM>the behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar 
nature</EM>); MC E2.A4.1.3.3 (<EM>there is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM>); and MC E2.A4.1.3.4 (<EM>the behavior no longer serves as a basis of coercion, 
exploitation, or duress</EM>).  The extra-marital affairs happened prior to 1983 and Applicant told his wife about them in 1999.  The behavior is over 20 years old and thus not recent.  Since he told his wife 
about them, they no longer serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. However, the sexual harassment incident occurred in 2004 and thus is recent.  This puts the extra-marital affairs in a 
different perspective since the sexual harassment is recent conduct similar in nature to the extra-marital affairs.  Applicant's sexual behavior towards the female employee could have led to extra-marital 
sexual activity if the female employee had consented.  The act was criminal in nature, even though probably a misdemeanor, because it was offensive touching that was not consented to by the female.  
There is recent or subsequent sexual behavior similar to the extra-marital affairs, and his sexual harassment action is evidence of questionable judgment and irresponsibility.  However as noted above, 
Applicant's reasons for not telling his wife are reasonable under the circumstances and no longer a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  I find against Applicant for sexual behavior.  Applicant has 
failed to present sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns for sexual behavior based on the extra-marital affairs followed by a DWI and a recent act of sexual harassment caused by alcohol 
consumption.</P> 
 
<P>The government raises security concerns for Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) based on the 2002 DWI, and the 2004 sexual harassment incident that was precipitated by alcohol consumption.  
Applicant's admission to the DWI and the sexual harassment after drinking alcohol raises Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use)</EM>: and DC E2.A7.1.2.2 (<EM>alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting 
for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job</EM>).  DWI is one of the examples used for an alcohol-related incident away from work.  Applicant was drinking with other 
employees while on a business trip.  After an evening of drinking alcohol, he sexually harassed a female employee.  The sexual harassment incident can be considered an alcohol-related incident away 
from work because it was not at the normal workplace and an alcohol-related incident at work since it happened with a subordinate while on a business trip.  The driving while intoxicated and the sexual 
harassment after drinking alcohol establish the disqualifying conditions under alcohol consumption.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised by his response to the SOR and FORM Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A7.1.3.1 (<EM>the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern); </EM>MC E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>the 
problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>); and E2.A7.1.3.3 (<EM>positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>).  Even though there are a few years 
between the driving while intoxicated offense and the sexual harassment incident after drinking alcohol, there is a pattern.  Applicant drinks alcohol and then engages in conduct that shows questionable 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  The last alcohol-related incident was in 2004, and is recent.  In response to the FORM, Applicant related a number of incidents that he handled well to indicate 
his sobriety.  He notes in the response, he has maintained his sobriety for 14 months.  However, other than his response, he presents no other information supportive of sobriety.  He provides no 
information on any programs or steps he has taken to support his sobriety.  The events do show a pattern, there are recent alcohol-related events that raise a security concern, and Applicant has not 
established sufficient positive changes supportive of sobriety.  Applicant has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns for alcohol consumption.</P> 
 
<P>The determination of Applicant's security worthiness requires a very careful and full analysis of his conduct under the "whole person" concept.  The adjudication of security worthiness is an 
examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  The whole person examination is a weighing of a number of 
variables.  All available, reliable information about the person past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching an overall common sense determination based on the careful 
consideration of: (1) <EM>the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </EM>(2) <EM>the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</EM>; (3) <EM>the frequency and recency of the 
conduct</EM>; (4) <EM>the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</EM>;<EM> </EM>(5) <EM>the voluntariness of participation;</EM> (6) <EM>the presence or absence of rehabilitation or other pertinent behavioral changes;</EM> (7) 
<EM>the motivation for the conduct</EM>; (8) <EM>the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; </EM>and (9) <EM>the likelihood of continuation or recurrence</EM>.  I considered Applicant's sleep apnea medical 
condition, but find the condition does not affect his thought process related to his alcohol consumption or engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior.  I considered that Applicant's supervisors state that 
he is highly regarded for his work and is a benefit to his company.  The allegations in the SOR taken together and in considering the "whole person," indicate a trustworthiness, reliability and judgment 
problem.  Applicant admits alcohol abuse is a problem for him.  After drinking alcohol, he drove while under the influence on one occasion and sexually harassed a female employee on another 
occasion.  This shows unreliability, questionable judgment, and untrustworthiness.  He has not mitigated the alcohol consumption concern.  The extra-marital affairs and the affirmative actions to 
engage in sexual harassment shows Applicant is not trustworthy and has poor judgment.  Even though, he knows alcohol abuse causes a problem for him, he still drinks.  His past history of exercising 
poor judgment after drinking alcohol raises a concern that he may engage in conduct that does not safeguard classified information.  Applicant's conduct indicates he is a security risk.  I conclude he is 
not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
