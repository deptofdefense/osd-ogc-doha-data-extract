<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On March 28, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied
or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached.</P>

<P>	Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about April 11, 1997.</P>

<P>	Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.
Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 8,
1997.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or
mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on May 13, 1997,
and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on July 22. 
The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted drug abuse militates against the granting
of a security clearance.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File
of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 49 years of age, and is employed by  a defense contractor
as a Visual Communications Manager.  He currently holds a secret security clearance, and his
employer seeks retention of this level clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</P>

<P><U>Criterion H - Drug involvement</U></P>

<P>	1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in August of 1981
(Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at page 8).  In about September of 1993, however, the Applicant began
to use marijuana (GX 5 at page 1).  He continued this use for the next three years.  He describes his
usage as "six times between September, 1993 to September, 1996" (GX 5 at page 1).</P>

<P>	On August 19, 1996, the Applicant inadvertently dropped a marijuana pipe from his pocket,
while at his place of employment (GX 5 at page 1).  As a result of this transgression, the Applicant
was "counseled regarding both company policy and government security clearance requirements
regarding drug use" (GX 6 at page 1).  He was also suspended for one day without pay.</P>

<P><U>Mitigation</U></P>

<P>	In his February 1997 sworn statement, the Applicant avers he has "absolutely no intention
of using marijuana again in the future" (GX 5 at page 1).</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 and Section F.3. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and
conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration
in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions<FONT FACE="Times"> should be followed in every case
</FONT>according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative
of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Drug Involvement</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner
that deviates from approved medical direction);</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession . . . .</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common
sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P> 		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequence involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in
the future.</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have
a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or
conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must make out a <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U> case under Criterion H (drug involvement)
which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational
connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely
to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P>	The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. The Government must be able to place a high
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at
all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his
private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude
towards security rules and regulations.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant's marijuana abuse spans a period of about three years.  It culminated with him
being caught with a smoking device at the work place in August of 1996.  Although the Applicant's
drug abuse was sporadic during this three year period, his last usage was less than eight  months ago
(the date of the Government's FORM ends the time line used for adjudication purposes in this case). 
It now appears that the Applicant intends no future drug abuse, however, it is too soon to say that
his fairly recent usage, as evidenced by his bringing his marijuana pipe to his place of employment, 
is not of present security significance.</P>

<P>	Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U>
case regarding his drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of
Criterion H, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden
of persuasion under Criterion H.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1:<CENTER>AGAINST THE APPLICANT</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	a.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	b.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	c.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and
<STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <U>supra</U>.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
