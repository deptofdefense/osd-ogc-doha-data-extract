</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On July 1, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-08103.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-08103.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on July 18, 2003,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 30, 2003.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 16.  By letter dated January 5, 2004, a 
copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  On 
February 17, 2004, Applicant filed  two additional documents in response to the FORM.  Department Counsel did not object to Applicant's submissions. On 
February 26, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains 17 allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Eight allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; eight allegations 
relate to conduct charged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption; and one allegation relates to conduct charged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the eight allegations charged under the criminal conduct guideline, eight allegations charged under the alcohol 
consumption guideline, and the one allegation charged under the financial considerations guideline.<A HREF="02-08103.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's  admissions are incorporated as findings of 
fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, who is 48 years old, has been employed as a station mechanic by a government contractor since 1990.  He works in a rural environment.  He was 
married in 1994 and divorced in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal conduct included an arrest and conviction in November 1975 for non-aggravated assault and criminal trespass; an arrest and charge of 
disorderly conduct in April 1979; and an arrest and conviction in October 1979 for driving while his license was suspended.  In August 1989 Applicant was 
again arrested and charged with driving while his license was suspended.  He pled <EM>nolo contendere</EM>, was sentenced, fined, and placed on probation for five 
years. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a familial history of alcohol abuse.  Both parents were alcoholics, and Applicant's three brothers have abused alcohol.  Applicant and his siblings 
were physically abused by their parents when they were children.  (Item 10, at 5, 15)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking beer in high school.  (Item. 6)  After high school, as a construction worker, he began drinking whiskey and vodka.  In November 
1978,  June 2000, and January 1984, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was found guilty of all three offenses 
and was fined and sentenced.  In 1984, Applicant was transferred from jail, where he was serving a sentence for driving under the influence of alcohol, to an in-patient alcohol abuse treatment program, where he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a credentialed medical professional.  He completed the treatment and 
after care program and remained sober for 15 years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's marriage ended in 1999 and he was divorced from his wife.  The break-up of his marriage caused Applicant  to drink alcohol again.  In January 
1999, Applicant was arrested, charged, and found guilty of driving while intoxicated.  He entered an alcohol treatment program and was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent by a credentialed medical professional.  He successfully completed the treatment program and the aftercare program in 2001.  His diagnosis was 
alcohol dependence in remission.  Applicant acknowledges he is an alcoholic.  He is committed to sobriety and an alcohol-free life.  He attends Alcoholics 
Anonymous (A.A.) meetings regularly, reads material and guidance produced by A.A., and stays in touch with other recovering alcoholics he has meet in the 
program. (Item 3)  He has not had a drink of alcohol since December 2000.  (Item 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant described his work environment as one in which inspectors and co-workers often drink alcohol at the job site.  He stated he was not motivated to join 
them in drinking and, despite these pressures, has elected to remain alcohol free. (Response to File of Relevant Material, at 1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant states he and his former wife agreed to divide their debts when they were divorced.  He says his former wife was responsible for a debt listed on a 
2003 credit report as in collection status and identified in the SOR as belonging to him.  He reports she is paying the debt, but he will pay it if she does not. 
Since October 2003, Applicant has successfully applied for a home loan and a personal loan.  His financial situation appears stable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant had been arrested and found guilty in 1999 of driving while intoxicated and that he had been 
sentenced and fined (&para; 1.a.); that he had been arrested and charged with driving with a suspended license in 1989, that he had pleaded <EM>nolo contendere </EM>to the 
charge, was fined $3000, and placed on probation for five years (&para; 1.b.); that he had been arrested, charged, and found guilty of driving under the influence of 
alcohol in January 1984, and was sentenced, fined, and placed on probation for five years (&para; 1.c.); that in June 1980 he had been arrested and charged with 
driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a suspended license, was found guilty of both crimes, sentenced, fined, and placed on probation for one 
year for driving with a suspended license (&para; 1.d.); that in October 1979 he had been arrested, charged, and found guilty of driving while his license was 
suspended (&para; 1.e.); that in April 1979 he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct (&para; 1.f.); that in November 1978 he was arrested, charged, and found 
guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol, and was sentenced and fined (1.g.); and that in November 1975 he was arrested, charged, and found 
guilty of assault/non-aggravated and criminal trespass, and was sentenced and placed on probation for 180 days (1.h.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, is that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about his or her 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include allegations or admissions of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.) and evidence the individual committed a single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses (E2.A10.1.2.2.)  The record in this case and Applicant's admissions establish both of these disqualifying conditions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's criminal conduct. The record shows that the criminal conduct 
for which Applicant was arrested, charged and found guilty began in November 1975, almost 30 years ago, when he was approximately nineteen years of age.  
His most recent criminal activity occurred in January 1999, more than six years ago.  Applicant's criminal behavior is therefore not recent, and mitigating 
condition E2.A10.1.3.1 applies.  Additionally, the record shows Applicant has not been involved in criminal behavior for more than six years.   He has accepted 
responsibility for his actions and provides clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, thus making mitigating condition E2.A10.1.3.6 applicable to his case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's Criminal Conduct as described in &para;&para; 1. a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.g. was also evidence of excessive alcohol consumption, 
creating a concern under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  Under Guideline G, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested , charged, and found guilty of driving 
under the influence of alcohol in 1999 (&para; 2.a.); 1984 (&para; 2.b.); 1980 (&para;2.c.); and 1978 (2.d.).  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  
Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use (E2.A7.1.2.1.); diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional 
(<EM>e.g.</EM> physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol dependence (E2.A7.1.2.3); and consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism 
by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. (E2.A7.1.2.6.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline G conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits four convictions for driving under the 
influence of alcohol, disqualifying conduct under E2.A7.1.2.1. He admits to being diagnosed and treated for alcohol dependence and cocaine abuse in 1984 and 
graduating from a chemical dependency aftercare program in 1985.  He admits to relapsing into alcohol use in 1999 when his marriage was ending.  He admits 
to being diagnosed again as alcohol dependent and receiving treatment from September 2000 to October 2001.  Applicant's admissions thus raise concerns 
under disqualifying conditions E2.A7.1.2.3. and E2.A7.1.2.6. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits to being alcohol dependent.  He points out that he has been sober since 2000 and has no intention to use alcohol in the future.  He attends A. 
A. meetings regularly, reads counseling literature prepared by A.A., and consults with recovering alcoholics he has met through the A.A. program.  The medical 
professional who diagnosed Applicant's alcohol dependency provided a positive but guarded prognosis. She attested to his commitment to sobriety and his 
successful completion of the alcohol dependence program in 2001.  She assessed him as an open and honest individual.  The doctor stated she was unable, 
because she was not his primary clinician, to evaluate whether the Applicant's condition might cause a defect in his judgment or reliability and his ability to 
withstand social and employment pressures.  She speculated that if Applicant were to experience personal emotional stress in the future that was as debilitating 
as he experienced at the break-up of his marriage, he might be vulnerable to relapse. (Item 9, at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's circumstances suggest three mitigating factors apply to his case.  First, mitigating condition E2.A7.1.3.2. is applicable because Applicant's alcohol 
dependence occurred a number of years ago, and there is no indication of a problem since 2000.  Second, Applicant demonstrates a strong desire to overcome 
his alcohol dependence.  His conduct demonstrates positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety, making mitigating condition E2.A7.1.3.3. applicable.  
Third, following a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence, Applicant has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare 
requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and has received a 
favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  I conclude that mitigating condition E2.A7.1.3.4 also applies to Applicant's case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had one unpaid delinquent debt in the amount of $4,200 that had not been paid as of June 2003. (&para; 3.a.)  An applicant 
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  Applicant's delinquent debt raises 
security concerns under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1 and E2.A6.1.2.3 of Guideline F..</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debt and indicated it arose during his marriage.  He stated he and his wife agreed he would pay 
her debt on her repossessed automobile and she would pay the debt specified in the SOR.  Applicant stated his former wife told him in June 2003 that she was 
paying down the debt as they had agreed.  Applicant expressed his intent to make arrangements to pay the debt if his former wife did not. He stated he has 
established good credit, settled or paid debts he was responsible for, and has no current financial problems. (Item 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through the FORM and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant owes a delinquent debt of approximately 
$4,200.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquency involves a long-standing debt which continues to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. does not apply to this case.  
However, the debt is singular and a carry-over from Applicant's former marriage.  Applicant's former wife agreed to retire the debt and then apparently did not 
do so, giving rise to the delinquency alleged in the SOR.  In his signed, sworn statement and in his answer to the SOR, Applicant offers evidence that he 
initiated good-faith efforts to see that the debts he was responsible for were repaid or otherwise resolved. (Ex. 3; Ex. 6)  He has indicated he will pay the debt 
alleged in the SOR if his former wife is unwilling or unable to do so.  Thus, mitigating condition E.2.A6.1.3.6 applies to Applicant's case.  Additionally, the 
delinquency is an isolated incident and the result of circumstances beyond Applicant's control, thus making mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.2 and E2.A6.1.3.3 
also applicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of evidence and under all of the Directive 
guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable under the facts of the case.  Under the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has 
successfully demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
