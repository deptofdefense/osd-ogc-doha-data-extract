</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant--a 57-year-old married man employed by a defense contractor as a telephone mechanic--falsified his security-clearance application when he 
deliberately omitted or concealed two incidents of bad checks resulting in arrest and criminal charges. Applicant's evidence in mitigation or extenuation is 
insufficient to overcome the negative security implications stemming from the falsifications, the related criminal conduct, as well as a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 25, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline E for personal conduct, Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline F for financial considerations. </P> 
<P>On July 22, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record. In his Answer, Applicant's responses to the 
SOR allegations are mixed, admitting some, admitting some with qualifications, and denying other allegations.</P> 
<P>On October 23, 2002, DOHA assigned this case to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Thereafter, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties 
scheduling the hearing for November 25, 2002, at a location near Applicant's place of employment. </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 4); no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered 
his own testimony, and offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - D). DOHA received the hearing transcript on December 4,  2002. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old married man. He and his spouse have two children, ages 11 and 8. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a telephone 
mechanic installing telephones and telephone lines in buildings. He has worked for his current employer since October 1991. In conjunction with his 
employment, Applicant is required to hold a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant is active in his local community as demonstrated by his involvement with a church.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The church's pastor has known Applicant for more than 20 
years and vouches for Applicant's general character and honesty.</P> 
<P>From May 1963 to May 1967, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force serving as a security policeman. He was honorably discharged at the rank 
of sergeant (pay grade E-4).</P> 
<P>On two occasions Applicant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of "fraudulent check." On the first occasion, in October 1997 Applicant wrote a $20 
check to a local restaurant and the check bounced. After the check was returned NSF, Applicant went to the restaurant and paid it. Nevertheless, in January 
1998 the local sheriff's office issued an arrest warrant for Applicant. He reported to the sheriff's office where he was fingerprinted and briefly held in a jail cell 
until being brought to court where he was released. The next month Applicant appeared in court, the merchant did not, and the court dismissed the charge.</P> 
<P>The second occasion took place in about December 1999 when Applicant wrote an NSF check for $25 to a medical-service provider. Applicant also made good 
on this check after learning it had bounced. Nevertheless, in August 2000 the local sheriff's office issued an arrest warrant for Applicant. He again reported to 
that office where he was fingerprinted and briefly held in a jail cell until being brought to court where he was released. The next month, on or about September 
27, 2000,  Applicant appeared in court, pled guilty and was awarded a sentence of 30 days confinement, which was suspended conditioned on paying a $166 
fine. Applicant paid the fine and served no confinement. </P> 
<P>A credit report<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> was obtained as part of Applicant's background investigation. In summary, it revealed two accounts 30-days past due, one account 90-days 
past due, two accounts 120-days past due, six accounts in a collection/charge off status, and one foreclosure, but no repossessions.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Concerning the five debts 
alleged in the SOR, the record shows as follows:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>Foreclosure proceedings started against his residence in approximately June 1995 after Applicant fell 90-days past due with his monthly mortgage payments.</LI> 
</UL> 
<P>On or about October 13, 2000, Applicant completed and signed a security-clearance application.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> For Questions 12 through 43, he submitted a "clean" 
application in that he answered all questions "No," thereby denying any potential derogatory information called for by the scope of the particular question. 
Concerning the falsification allegations in the SOR, Applicant answered Question 26 "No" indicating he had not been arrested for, charged with, or convicted 
of any offenses  within the last seven years not otherwise listed in the application. Applicant also answered Question 35 "No," thereby denying having any 
property repossessed within the last seven years. Also concerning  his financial record, Applicant answered Questions 38<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and 39<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> in the negative thereby 
denying any past-due debts for the relevant periods.  </P> 
<P>Applicant was also interviewed during the background investigation and that interview resulted in a written statement.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In his August 2001 statement, 
Applicant agreed that the credit report accurately reflected the foreclosure account and the collection accounts. He explained the circumstances surrounding the 
foreclosure (family medical problems) and said he had obtained a waiver from the VA for any unpaid balance. Concerning the collection accounts, he explained 
the three medical bills, which were apparently not covered by his insurance, stemmed from his hospital stay following a car accident. The remaining $5 
collection account was for a returned check fee that he had forgotten to pay. </P> 
<P>Applicant's hearing testimony was consistent with this explanation. In addition, other than making a single $25 payment on the largest medical bill in July 
2002, Applicant had made no payments on the four collection accounts. He did so on the advice of a financial counselor he and his spouse having been working 
with for the past year or so to improve their overall credit. Applicant was unable to find any information on the $5 collection account.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He also presented 
evidence that his checking account was in good standing with no NSF items within the past year.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Although Applicant produced some correspondence<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
relating to the home foreclosure, he did not produce the actual "waiver" document issued by the VA.</P> 
<P>Concerning the alleged falsifications, Applicant maintains he had no intention to deliberately omit or conceal his criminal history or his derogatory financial 
history. Based on the record evidence as a whole, I specifically make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<OL> 
  <LI>Applicant's "No" answer to Question 26, which concerned other criminal offenses not reported elsewhere in the security-clearance application, was 
deliberately false; his explanations to the contrary are not credible.</LI> 
repossessions. Moreover, the foreclosure action against Applicant's former residence does not constitute repossession as that word is commonly used and 
understood.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Indeed, the government's own exhibit, the credit report, distinguishes between foreclosure and repossession.</LI> 
contrary are not credible. </LI> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following adjudication guidelines are most 
pertinent here: Guideline E for personal conduct, Guideline J for criminal conduct,<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and Guideline F for financial considerations.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an 
applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against them.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> In addition, an 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN><EM>Section 1-Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. Omission of a past arrest or past drug use, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported. </P> 
<P>Here, considering the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline E. I'm persuaded by substantial evidence that 
Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed material information when responding to three questions on his security-clearance application.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> He omitted or 
concealed both bad check offenses, the home foreclosure, and four collection accounts in response to Questions 26, 38, and 39. Concerning Question 26, I 
cannot reconcile his explanation for his negative answer in light of his age, prior military service in the security police, and the fact that he was processed, 
fingerprinted, held at the sheriff's office, and went to court for both bad check offenses. This is especially so considering Applicant pled guilty to the most 
recent bad check offense on or about September 27, 2000, about two weeks before completing and signing his security-clearance application. Concerning 
Questions 38 and 39, given the financial troubles he had experienced, especially the foreclosure in 1995 and the $85 medical bill referred for collection in May 
2000, Applicant knew or should have known that he was required to make some sort of disclosure of his derogatory financial history. Instead, he revealed 
nothing.</P> 
<P>By submitting a "clean" application, he painted a picture of a person without a history of financial troubles. That was not the case. His failure to fully reveal the 
bad check offenses and other derogatory financial information suggests he cannot be relied upon to tell the truth if the truth presents possible adverse 
consequences for his own interests, which is inconsistent with having access to classified information. And I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) 
under Guideline E and conclude none apply given the record evidence. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><CENTER><STRONG>Section 2-Criminal Conduct</CENTER> 
</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern where a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline J. In addition to his two fairly recent bad check 
offenses, Applicant's falsification of his security-clearance application in violation of federal criminal law is evidence of a history of illegal behavior. </SPAN>These 
facts justify applying two disqualifying conditions,<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> which, in turn, raise security concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN> And I have 
reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline J and conclude none apply given the record evidence. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against 
Applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><EM>Section 3-Financial Considerations</CENTER> 
</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in their obligation to protect 
classified information. <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline F. The record shows (1) a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations, (2) illegal financial practices, and (3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The NSF checks, the foreclosure, and the collection 
accounts support these conclusions. The same facts also support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. His financial irresponsibility is a security concern 
because it raises the possibility he may be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in his obligation to properly safeguard or handle classified 
information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none apply. Although Applicant presented some evidence that he and his spouse are 
working with a financial counselor to improve their overall credit, the evidence was not so strong as to persuade me that there are clear indications their 
financial problems are being resolved.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Likewise, given the four collection accounts are still outstanding, coupled with no affirmative evidence that Applicant 
did in fact receive the VA waiver for any outstanding balance stemming from the foreclosure, I cannot conclude Applicant has engaged in a good-faith effort to 
repay the creditors or otherwise resolve the debts.<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Finally, although Applicant experienced family medical problems that contributed to the financial 
problems, those circumstances ended when his father passed away in October 1990 and his mother-in-law passed away in March 1994. Substantial time has 
since passed and Applicant's financial problems persist, and so, the relevant mitigating condition<A HREF="01-21864.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> cannot be applied. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To sum up, the record evidence establishes Applicant has a history of financial  troubles including collection accounts and NSF checks resulting in criminal 
charges against him. Making the situation worse, Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed this derogatory information when completing his security-clearance application. Taken together, these facts and circumstances create a reasonable doubt about Applicant's fitness for access to classified information. As 
required by the clearly-consistent standard, that doubt is resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P>
