<P>On September 15, 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 85P).<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On October 4, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her,<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges trustworthiness 
concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her access to sensitive information, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a such access 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer, notarized on October 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  On December 21, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  
Applicant received fifteen days oral notice of her hearing, and waived her right to fifteen days written notice (record of proceedings (R.) 15).  Her hearing was held on January 30, 2007.  DOHA 
received the hearing record (R.) on February 7, 2007, and I received it on February 8, 2007.   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guidelines F and E, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.d; 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.l to 1.p.  She denied the other SOR-alleged 
debts without elaboration.  In her response to the SOR, she did not address the falsification allegation in SOR &para; 2.a.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 47 years old (R. 44).<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She is a high school graduate.  She is not married (R. 45).

month remaining until her car is paid off (R. 47; Ex. B at 2).  She currently has three active credit cards with balances of $400, $600, and $7,000 (R. 48).  The payments are current and not 
delinquent on these three credit cards (R. 48-49).  She is paying off the two credit card debts with the least balances at the rate of $100 each per month (R. 49).  She has allocated monthly payments

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. You said you misunderstood the question.  Can you tell us what you thought at the time when you were filling out this application?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A. Well, if I had anything over 180 days, and I wasn't paying on anything over 180 days for years, and I just didn't have anything that I was paying on, so I thought I didn't have it.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. Let me see if I can - - tell me if I'm getting it wrong - - try to figure this out.  You're saying because you weren't making payments on any of these debts, you didn't consider them delinquent 
debts.  It that a fair - - I just trying to understand what you were thinking.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A. Well, I just hadn't paid on them, and I forgot about them, I guess.  It's been years and years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. Some of the debts we talked about had been placed for collection as late as 2003 . . .? </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A. I think because I started making payments on them, it started activating again.  Otherwise, they hadn't had any.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. So because you hadn't made any payments on any of these debts, you just considered them not a part of your credit?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A. I didn't - - like I hadn't paid for them in years, and I didn't - - I knew they had to be there, but I hadn't paid on them, and I didn't consider them as my current status.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. So even though you knew you had them, because you hadn't paid on them, you didn't consider them current debts that you had.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an evaluation of an applicant's trustworthinss suitability, an administrative judge must consider the "Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information" 
(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are 
used to determine an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines &para; 2. An administrative judge's over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guidelines &para; 2(c).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Guidelines &para; 2(a): "(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that "[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security." Guidelines &para; 2(b); Regulation &para; C2.1.2.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions 
that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for 
presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion 
as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the Government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guidelines &para; 18 articulates the Government's concern concerning financial problems. "Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor 
self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified

In July and August 2006, she made 2 or 3

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;</SPAN></P>

<P>The Guidelines do not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> I conclude 
Guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 20(a)</SPAN> does not apply because Applicant had multiple (five) delinquent SOR debts at the time of her hearing, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and she is not making payments on the </SPAN>debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.c, 1.g, 1.l, 1.n, and

However, her financial difficulties remain largely unexplained.  Although unemployment caused her financial problems, she has not provided enough information about changes in her financial

<P>The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they</SPAN> stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The 
cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential 
defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their 
rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.</P>

<P>The record evidence does not establish that she has taken timely actions to resolve her financial jeopardy over the last several years.  Moreover, she has not provided sufficient information about how 
she attempted to resolve or repay her SOR debts. In sum, she has not demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns because over the last 5 months she has not made any payments on the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant gave an incorrect answer to question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P.  The evidence of record, however, does not establish deliberate falsification.  Although she admitted preparing her SF 85P, 
and answering incorrectly, she did not fully understand what information the question was designed to obtain.<A HREF="06-12656.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Her statements show confusion about which debts were supposed to be disclosed. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
At the time she completed her SF 85P, she thought that the answers she provided were correct. A trustworthiness concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of personal 
conduct mitigating conditions.  Guidelines &para; 17(f) provides </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"the information was unsubstantiated." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The allegation in SOR &para; 2.a is not established by substantial evidence because her erroneous

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guidelines  &para; 2(a)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">.  As noted 
above, Applicant's failure to make progress resolving five of her SOR debts is a serious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to be a trustworthiness concern. Her actions were 
knowledgeable and voluntary.  </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Five of her SOR debts are currently unpaid, are not in a payment plan and are not otherwise resolved.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">She is 47 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for 
her conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><SUP></SUP>The motivation for her failure to pay her debts was caused by low income as well as poor financial choices.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> A person "who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds" and as such there is the potential for pressure and exploitation.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  The likelihood of recurrence cannot yet be determined because insufficient evidence was presented about 
improvement in her financial situation, and corroborating evidence of change is sparse.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence.  Her financial problems were aggravated by her unemployment, especially in 2004.  She was unemployed through no fault of 
her own.  The reduction in the magnitude and number of her debts that creditors can legally enforce because of the application of the statute of limitations has reduced her potential vulnerability to 
improper financial inducements. The degree that she is "financially overextended," is also greatly reduced.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She received some financial counseling and budgeting assistance from her brother.  The 
absence of evidence of any prior violation of her employer's rules or requirements, her forthright and candid statement at her hearing, her solid performance as an employee and her evident sincerity 
about making future financial progress all weigh in her favor.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her lack of financial sophistication was illustrated in her confused statement at her hearing about completion of her SF 85P, as well as 
her conflicting descriptions of her responsibility for various debts and her attempts to resolve her debts.  The adverse information about some debts in her credit report is not sufficient to outweigh her 
statement denying knowledge of 12 SOR debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude after careful consideration of all the evidence that the SOR debts in &para;&para; 1.a to 1.b, 1.d to 1.f, 1.h to 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.q are not 
substantiated</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is, however, a paucity of supporting evidence of actions taken to establish her financial rehabilitation over the five months preceding her hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> She acknowledged the validity of the debts in 
SOR &para;&para; 1.c, 1.g, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.p, and I conclude that these five delinquent debts are substantiated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I<STRONG> </STRONG> conclude she has not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations, but she has mitigated concerns about her  personal conduct.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG>The 
evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's trustworthiness eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v.
