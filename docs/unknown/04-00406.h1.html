<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 24, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  It alleges Applicant's father is a citizen and 
resident of the Republic of Korea (ROK) (&para; 1.a.); his mother is a citizen of the ROK and resides with Applicant in the U.S. (&para; 1.b.);</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> his sister is a citizen and 
resident of the ROK but maintains U.S. resident alien status (&para; 1.c.); Applicant traveled to the ROK from about July 2 to August 7, 1996, May 8 to August 13, 
1997, July 31 to August 13, 1999, and January 30 to March 14, 2002 (&para; 1.d.); and he traveled to the People's Republic of China (PRC) from July 17 to July 31, 
1999, to visit his father (&para; 1.e.).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 23, 2005.  He admitted all the allegations and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on June 27, 
2005, and I convened the hearing on August 22, 2005.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 29-year-old unmarried employee of a defense contractor.  He was born in the ROK, where  he lived for 11 years.  In 1987, he and his family 
moved to Hong Kong and lived there for four years.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He came to the U.S. in 1991, attended college, and received a bachelor's degree in computer science in 
December 2001.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on April 20, 2001, and obtained a U.S. passport on June 29, 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant held a ROK passport from May 1996 until it expired on May 23, 2001, but he did not use his ROK passport during the one month between its 
expiration and his naturalization.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  His father has removed him from the ROK census family register.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  As a naturalized U.S. citizen, he has no military 
obligation in the ROK.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He has held interim clearances as a State Department contractor and in his current position as a contractor for the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is a citizen and resident of the ROK.  His father intends to come to the U.S. and live in the house jointly owned by Applicant and his mother, 
but he has remained in the ROK to care for his mother, who is in her late 80s.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He intends to live in the U.S. after his mother is no longer requires his care.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  
Applicant's father visits the family in the U.S. often, staying with Applicant and Applicant's mother for two or three months on each visit.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father worked for a large chemical conglomerate in the ROK.  He was assigned to a branch office in Hong Kong for four years, accompanied by his 
family.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He is now retired, but he still works as a consultant to the company.  He occasionally travels to the PRC to promote business for ROK companies.  
Except for military service during his youth, Applicant's father has no past or present connection with the ROK government.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and sister are citizens of the ROK but they are registered in the U.S. as permanent resident aliens.  His mother resides with him in the house 
they jointly own.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant's sister attended high school and college in the U.S., but she lives in the ROK for a U.S.-owned company doing business in the 
ROK.  Her company designs corporate logos and creates corporate marketing slogans.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Applicant communicates with his sister once or twice a month.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother has been a homemaker and housewife all her life and has no connection with the ROK government.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  She returns to the ROK twice a year 
to visit her husband, and stays for two or three months each time.  She is financially supported by Applicant while she is in the U.S. and by her husband while 
she is in the ROK.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother's sister is married to a retired Army colonel who spent his career as a military intelligence officer with a top secret clearance and has been 
employed for the last five years for a defense contractor currently supporting the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Applicant's uncle-in-law has known him 
since 1997-98, when Applicant was in college.  His uncle-in-law knows Applicant's parents well and regards them as loyal to the U.S.  He testified Applicant's 
family has been planning for two years to live permanently in the U.S., but full execution of the plan has been delayed by the need for Applicant's father to care 
for his aging mother.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has traveled to the ROK three times to visit his family.  He visited Beijing, PRC, once while his father was working there.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ROK does not have a repressive or authoritarian government.  It is a stable democratic republic with an elected president and legislature and an 
independent judiciary.  It is a friend and ally of the U.S.  The U.S. is obligated under the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty to help the ROK defend itself against 
external aggression.  The ROK economy is growing, and the ROK is a major trading partner with the U.S.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Privately sponsored economic espionage and government sponsored industrial espionage are matters of serious concern to the U.S.  The U.S. is vulnerable to 
economic and industrial espionage from friends like the ROK as well as enemies.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The ROK intelligence community is known to target the U.S.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  Furthermore, a disqualifying condition (DC 2) may arise if an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or 
persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists." The totality of an applicant's family ties to a 
foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 1 is established because 
members of Applicant's immediate family are citizens or residents of a foreign country.  DC 2 also is established, because Applicant and his mother share 
living quarters.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members . . .  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted to 
Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although the ROK historically has been regarded as 
friendly to the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes 
dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is not an agent of a foreign power.  He has worked in private industry all his adult life.  He has no present or past connection with the ROK 
government.  His travel to the PRC was to promote the business of his private employer in the ROK.  He does not depend on the ROK for financial support.  
His work as a consultant is connected with seeking new business opportunities rather than development of new technology.  As such, his business connections 
are not likely to make him vulnerable to coercion, persuasion, or duress by practitioners of private economic espionage or government industrial espionage.  He 
intends to emigrate to the U.S. as soon as he is relieved of his obligation to his aging mother.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is a permanent resident of the U.S. and spends more than half her time in the U.S.  She has never been connected with the ROK government 
and is not dependent on the government for financial support.  She has no business connections that would lend themselves to exploitation, private economic 
espionage, or government industrial espionage.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's travel to the ROK and the PRC was related to his relationships with his parents, and it raises no security concern independent of his relationship 
with his parents and sister.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sister is a permanent resident of the U.S.  She temporarily resides in the ROK for business purposes, and is not connected with the ROK 
government.  Her work in commercial graphic design does not lend itself to exploitation, private economic espionage, or government industrial espionage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative.  They must be considered together in light of the record evidence as a whole.  
The Appeal Board has made it clear that the burden of disproving a mitigating condition is never shifted to the Government.<A HREF="04-00406.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, Applicant's 
evidence of his family's absence of governmental connections, financial dependence on the government, or business connections susceptible to industrial 
espionage is relevant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against clearing applicants with foreign family ties.  After evaluating each 
family member's individual circumstances as well as the totality of Applicant's family ties to the ROK, I conclude MC 1 is established.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ROK is a close ally, friend, and trading partner of the U.S., and relies on the U.S. for help defending itself.  It has a good human rights record.  The nature 
of the ROK's government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are all relevant factors in 
evaluating the likelihood that the ROK would risk damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to force a 
U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and making a commonsense evaluation of the evidence, I conclude 
the security concern based on foreign influence is mitigated.</SPAN></P>
