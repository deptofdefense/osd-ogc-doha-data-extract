<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant </SPAN>an application for a trustworthiness determination<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Department of Defense 
Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, (</EM>Jan. 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On </SPAN>December 23, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under </SPAN>Guideline H (drug involvement), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and 
Guideline E (personal conduct).</P> 
 
<P>On January 5, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 14, 2006, Applicant 
received a complete copy of the government's file of relevant material (FORM) dated March 7, 2006.  Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation. On April 13, 2006, Applicant 's response to the FORM was due. No response has been received. 
On May 1, 2005, I was assigned the case.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges security concerns under the Guidelines for Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the 
allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 30 years old and has worked as a technical assistant for a defense contractor since August 2000.  In March 2004, Applicant submitted a Public 
Trust Position Application. </P> 
 
<P>In August 2004, Applicant separated from his spouse.  In September 2004, Applicant-- then 28 years old--received a marijuana "blunt," which is slightly 
larger than a marijuana cigarette (Item 5), from a friend. After smoking the marijuana at a hotel, the police arrived. He was taken to the police station, 
processed, released, and received a summons in the mail. He was charged with violation of controlled substance/drug/device and cosmetic act. In a November 
2004 sworn  statement (Item 5), Applicant states he did not tell his spouse or family about the incident because he was embarrassed.  In his January 2006 
answer to the SOR, he denied embarrassment was the reason for not telling them, but provided no additional reason for his decision not to tell his spouse or 
family. There is no evidence his spouse and family were ever informed of his arrest. </P> 
 
<P>In  October 2005, Applicant was placed in the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) program, which required supervision by the county probation and 
parol office.  Upon successful completion of the program the charge would be dropped.  In December 2005, he was notified by the probation and parole office 
that if he paid $75, he would be dismissed from the ARD program and the charges against him dismissed. </P> 
 
<P>His prior use of marijuana had occurred when he was a teenager and during his early 20's, Applicant used marijuana once or twice a year at parties, due to peer 
pressure. In his November 2004 sworn statement, Applicant asserts he will refrain from future use of marijuana. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. The President has "the authority to 
. . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that 
will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  To be eligible to occupy an Information Systems Position designated ADP II/III, an applicant must meet 
the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  The standard that must be met is that based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, 
and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The Regulation sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Considering the evidence as a whole, I 
conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are drug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. </P> 
 
<P>DoD contractor personnel are afforded the rights to the procedures contained in the DoD Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be 
made.<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  An 
applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  "[T]he 
Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant's security 
suitability."<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national 
security."<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation, Appendix 8.  A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the 
government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="05-07943.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline H, drug involvement.  Under drug involvement, the security eligibility of an applicant 
is placed into question when that applicant is involved with illegal drugs. The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an 
applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the 
risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Applicant used marijuana in his late teens, his early 20's, and in September 2004 his use lead to 
arrest. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM>) applies. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant last used marijuana in September 2004 after having submitted a Public Trust Position Application in March 2004. This was a stupid thing to do. 
None of the Mitigating Condition apply.  His last usage was recent so Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 (<EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>) does not apply.  He 
used marijuana in his late teens, his early 20's, and at age 28.  His usage was not isolated or an aberrational event. Therefore, MC2 (<EM>The drug involvement was 
an isolated or aberrational event</EM>) does not apply. Applicant says he will not use marijuana or any other illegal drug again.  He has stated an intent to refrain 
from future usage, but the record is insufficient to establish a demonstrated intent not to use again. MC3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the 
future</EM>) does not apply. </P> 
 
<P>There is no evidence of any drug treatment program so MC 4 (<EM>Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and 
aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional</EM>) does not apply. </P> 
 
<P>Because his failure to reveal his arrest to his spouse and family is a personal conduct concern not a drug involvement concern, I find for him as to SOR 
paragraph 1.d.  I find against Applicant on the other drug related paragraphs and as to drug involvement.  </P> 
 
<P>The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under criminal conduct, Guideline J.  Under criminal conduct, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets.  A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break the rules.  Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession in September 2004 and illegally used marijuana at 
other times which violates the law.  DC 1 ( <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) applies. </P> 
 
<P>None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply.  MC 1(<EM>The criminal behavior is not recent</EM>)  does not apply because his most recent arrest occurred in 
September 2004, which is less than two years ago and is considered recent criminal behavior. MC 2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) does not apply 
because there was only one arrest but his illegal conduct, i.e., marijuana usage, occurred repeatedly, and therefore, his criminal behavior was not an isolated 
incident. MC 3 (<EM>The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life</EM>) and 4 (<EM>The 
person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>) do not apply.  Applicant's earlier marijuana usage 
was due to peer pressure and he states his most recent was due to family problems.  There is no evidence he is no longer subject to peer pressure, that his 
family problems have been resolved, or family problems will not recur in the future.  Under the circumstances, he failed to convince me his illegal drug use 
would not recur.</P> 
 
<P>MC 5 (<EM>Acquittal</EM>) is inapplicable.  MC6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) does not apply because the record does not establish clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation.  I find against the Applicant as to criminal conduct. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, personal conduct.  Under personal conduct the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination. Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security.</P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Following his arrest for marijuana possession, Applicant failed to disclose his arrest to his spouse 
and family. DC 4 (<EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>) 
applies.  Over a number of years Applicant used marijuana which is a pattern of rule violation, which makes DC5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, 
including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>) apply.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not told his spouse or family about his arrest.  Initially, in his November 2004 sworn statement, he says this was due to embarrassment.  In his 
January 2006 answer to the SOR, he says it was not due to embarrassment.  The question is not why he failed to reveal the arrest, but the fact he has failed to 
do so. As of January 2006, Applicant still had not told his wife or family of his arrest.  This failure to inform his spouse and family is troubling.  Not only did 
he fail to tell them about the initial arrest when it occurred, but failed to tell them when he went to court, when he was placed in the ARD program, when he 
was under the supervision of the country probation and parol office, and even after he had completed the ARD program. </P> 
 
<P>None of the mitigating factors relating to personal conduct apply.  I find against Applicant as to personal conduct. </P> 
 
<P>In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant 's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P>
