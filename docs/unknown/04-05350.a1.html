<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July 14, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the 
basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant 
requested the case be decided on the written record.  On June 13, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  
Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-05350.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  Rather, it contains new evidence in the form of documents and additional statements which indicate 
that Applicant has paid off, is making payments on, or is disputing the debts listed in the SOR.<A HREF="04-05350.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  Applicant has not made an allegation 
of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.</SPAN></P>

insufficient documentary evidence to corroborate his assertions that he had paid off, disputed, or otherwise resolved the debts at issue.  The Board has previously noted that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present 
documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P>
