<P>Applicant's falsification of clearance applications in January 2000 and August 2002 suggested he could not be relied upon to disclose the truth if it conflicted

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 23 October 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-13657.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 8 
November 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the File of Relevant 
aterial--issued 28 March 2003. The record closed on 5 July 2003, the date the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 21 July 2003.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 49-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously had a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 8 January 2000 and again on 28 August 2002, Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(Items 4, 5) by answering "no" to a 
question requiring Applicant to disclose any bankruptcy in the last seven years. In fact, he had filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 1997, obtaining 
a discharge in May 1997.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 30 July 2002 (Item 6)<A HREF="01-13657.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>, when questioned about his bankruptcy and his failure to disclose it, Applicant acknowledged getting in over his head with his credit 
cards. He also stated "I think you are asking to (sic) many personal questions, even though its (sic) your job, the reason for not putting the bankruptcy on the 
paper is its (sic) my personal business and didn't think that is any one elses (sic) business."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record is otherwise silent on Applicant's character or work performance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant knew he had filed bankruptcy in 1997, yet decided that information was none of the 
Government's business. While the failure to disclose did not prevent the Government from discovering the bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy itself was found to 
have no current security significance, neither fact is relevant to an assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information. The Government has 
an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The Government relies on 
Applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an Applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some 
indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the Government relies upon in order to 
perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs and 
assessment of his privacy issues ahead of legitimate Government interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
