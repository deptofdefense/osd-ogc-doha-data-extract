  Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, and Department Counsel does not have the burden of disproving its applicability.  Nothing in Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 distinguishes between agents of a  foreign power based on whether they work for an agency, department or entity that is defense-related or one that is not defense-related.  Department Counsel is  not required to prove that there is a clear and present danger or imminent threat to classified information before access to classified information is denied or  revoked.  Nor does Department Counsel have to prove that a particular foreign country is targeting a particular applicant before access to classified information  is denied or revoked.  The Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3 is not sustainable.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 27, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued a favorable security clearance decision, dated August 30, 2004.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1; (2) whether 
the Administrative Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3; and (3) if the Board concludes that Department Counsel has 
demonstrated the Administrative Judge erred in applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3, whether the Board should affirm the Administrative 
Judge's favorable decision on alternate grounds.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's ties to 
his parents and brothers living in Taiwan were mitigated under Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> because: (a) there is no evidence that Applicant's 
relatives are agents of Taiwan; (b) there is no evidence that Applicant could be influenced by agents of Taiwan because of his ties to relatives in Taiwan; (c) 
although Applicant's brothers work for agencies of the Taiwan government, they work for public utilities and not for any defense-related agency of Taiwan; (d) 
there is not a substantial likelihood that Applicant's immediate family members in Taiwan would exercise foreign influence over him; and (e) there is evidence 
that Applicant is not vulnerable to duress merely because of his family ties in Taiwan (Decision at p. 5).</P> 
<P>Department Counsel contends the Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues 
the following:</P> 
<P>(a) the record evidence shows that Applicant's brother worked for the agencies of the Taiwan government;</P> 
<P>(b) nothing in the plain language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 supports the Judge's distinction between (i) persons working in defense-related 
agencies or entities, and (ii) persons working in agencies or entities not related to defense matters;</P> 
<P>(c) Applicant did not meet his burden of demonstrating that application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 was warranted;</P> 
<P>(d) the Judge did not have a rational basis for concluding Applicant's immediate family members in Taiwan were not in a position to be exploited by the 
Taiwanese government;</P> 
<P>(e) application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 does not turn on what choice an applicant might make if a foreign government tries to exert 
influence or pressure on the applicant because of the applicant's ties to immediate family members in the foreign country;  and</P> 
<P>(f) the Judge erred by focusing on the possibility of Taiwan making threats or exerting coercive pressure on Applicant and ignoring the possibility of Taiwan 
trying to exert noncoercive influence on Applicant.</P> 
<P>Applicant asks the Board to sustain the Administrative Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 on the following grounds:</P> 
<P>(i) the record evidence shows Applicant's brothers are not agents of a foreign power;</P> 
<P>(ii) the record evidence shows Applicant's brothers work for companies "that have nothing to do with the Taiwanese government's magisterial functions, let 
alone its security apparati";</P> 
<P>(iii) the two Taiwanese companies for which Applicant's brothers work "were either privatized or nearly privatized," and Applicant's third brother "only works 
for the [Taiwanese] government in the most attenuated sense";</P> 
<P>(iv) in the alternative, even if Applicant's brothers could be considered agents of the Taiwanese government, they are not connected to that government "in any 
meaningful way";</P> 
<P>(v) the record evidence shows Applicant's immediate family members are not a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to 
choose between his family members and the United States; and</P> 
<P>(vi) the Administrative Judge could take notice of the nature of the historic relationship between Taiwan and the United States and conclude it is unlikely that 
Taiwan would engage in conduct that would put at risk its relationship with the United States.</P> 
<P>For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is not sustainable.</P> 
<P>First, Department Counsel is correct that Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant application of Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1.  Department Counsel does not have to disprove the applicability of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Moreover, the Administrative 
Judge does not have unfettered discretion when deciding whether or not application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is warranted.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Second, given the record evidence in this case, Applicant's three brothers are agents of a foreign power for purposes of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 
1.  Nothing in the plain language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 indicates or suggests that an Administrative Judge can conclude a person is not an 
agent of a foreign power merely because their employment with an agency, department or entity under the control of a foreign government is not defense-related.  Nothing in the language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 supports the Judge's distinction between (a) agencies, department, or entities 
under the control of a foreign government that are defense-related, and (b) agencies, departments or entities under the control of a foreign government that are 
not defense-related.  Moreover, there is no rational basis for a Judge to assume or conclude that a foreign government can exert influence or pressure on or 
through its citizens only if they are employed by, or are associated with, a defense-related component of the foreign government.</P> 
<P>Third, Department Counsel is correct in arguing that nothing in Guideline B (Foreign Influence) indicates or suggests that security concerns are raised only if an 
applicant is vulnerable to coercive forms of influence or pressure.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  To the extent that the Administrative Judge referred only to the possibility that coercive 
forms of influence or pressure might be used against Applicant, the Judge's analysis under Guideline B is flawed, incomplete, and not sustainable.</P> 
<P>Fourth, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to decide that Applicant was entitled to the application of Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1 based on the Judge's conclusion that even if the Taiwanese government were to try to exert influence or pressure on him  because of his ties to 
immediate family members in Taiwan Applicant would report the matter to company security representatives and would not compromise classified information.  
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 refers to an applicant not being in a position where a foreign power could force the applicant to have to make a choice 
between immediate family members and the United States; it does not mitigate a case based upon what choice the applicant might make if  forced to make such 
a choice.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  A person in a conflict of interest situation based on family ties is still in a conflict of interest situation regardless of what decision the person might 
make if a third party seeks to influence or pressure the person through the person's family ties.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  A federal employee in a conflict of interest situation does not 
alleviate the conflict of interest problem by asserting that he or she will make the right decision(s) despite the existence of the conflict of interest situation.  
Since the federal government is entitled to accept less risk with respect to security clearances than it does with routine civil service matters,<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> applicants in 
conflict of interest situations should not be held to a lesser standard than that required of federal employees.</P> 
<P>Fifth, the Board does not find persuasive Applicant's arguments concerning the nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations and the absence of evidence that Taiwan is 
targeting classified U.S. information.  The United States has a compelling interest in protecting classified information.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The  United States is entitled to protect 
classified information from all entities and individuals not authorized to have access to such information, not just those entities and individuals who are hostile 
to the United States.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Moreover, Department Counsel is not required to prove that there is a clear and present danger or imminent threat to classified 
information before access to classified information is denied or revoked.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Nor does Department Counsel have to prove that a particular foreign country is 
targeting a particular applicant before access to classified information is denied or revoked.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion that his access to 
classified information is clearly consistent with national security.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded Applicant's contacts 
with his immediate family members in Taiwan were mitigated under Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> (Decision at pp. 4, 5).  Department Counsel 
contends the record evidence does not support the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3.  Applicant counters by arguing the record 
evidence does support the Judge's application of that mitigating condition.</P> 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant's contacts with immediate family members are not casual.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, in assessing an applicant's 
contacts with foreign citizens, an Administrative Judge must consider the totality of those contacts, and not engage in a piecemeal evaluation of such 
contacts.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The Judge appears to be giving Applicant the benefit of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 because she concluded Applicant's contacts with 
his immediate family members have been casual and infrequent (Decision at p. 5).  Given the Judge's own findings about Applicant's contacts with his mother 
in Taiwan (Decision at p. 3), it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to conclude those contacts were infrequent.  Furthermore, Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition 3 refers to contacts that are "casual <STRONG>and</STRONG> infrequent" not "casual <STRONG>or</STRONG> infrequent." (emphasis added).<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the Judge's decision to 
apply Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 is arbitrary and capricious because: (a) it is not consistent with the plain language of the mitigating condition; 
(b) it is not supported by the record evidence as a whole; and (c) it runs contrary to the Judge's own finding about Applicant's contacts with his mother in 
Taiwan.  Applicant's argument in support of the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 is wholly unpersuasive.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">If the Board concludes that Department Counsel has demonstrated the Administrative Judge erred in applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1 and 
3, whether the Board should affirm the Administrative Judge's favorable decision on alternate grounds</SPAN>.  As discussed earlier in this decision, Applicant argues 
the Board should affirm the Administrative Judge's decision.   In the alternative, Applicant argues that if the Board concludes Department Counsel has 
demonstrated the Judge erred, then the Board should affirm the Judge's favorable decision because the Judge's errors would be harmless since the Judge's 
favorable decision can be affirmed on "multiple, independent bases."</P> 
<P>The errors identified on appeal, when viewed in their entirety, are not harmless.  However, the Board notes that it has held that the nonappealing party can argue 
that the Board should affirm the Administrative Judge's decision on alternate grounds.<A HREF="02-24267.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Construing Applicant's argument as raising that possibility -- 
because of its assertion that there are "multiple, independent bases" for affirming the Administrative Judge's decision -- the Board concludes that Applicant 
has not articulated persuasive reasons for affirming the Judge's decision on alternate grounds.  Furthermore, the Board does not find persuasive Applicant's 
fallback position that the Board should not reverse the Judge's decision, but rather should remand it to the Judge with instructions to issue a new decision after 
correction of her errors.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated errors that, viewed in their entirety, warrant reversal of the Administrative Judge's decision.   Pursuant to Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the Board reverses the Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
