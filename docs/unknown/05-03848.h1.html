<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a country other than the United States. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">applied for and was issued an Iranian 
passport, even though he was a United States citizen, and he used the Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran. </SPAN>He returned his Iranian passport to the proper Iranian authorities, but without expressing 
a desire to relinquish the passport. He also has expressed an unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship. Applicant has a close relationship with his <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">father-in-law and mother-in-law</SPAN>, who are 
citizens and residents of Iran. Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P>_______________________</P> 
 
<P>*Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">'s</SPAN> name was incorrectly transposed on the SOR.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 19, 2005, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to 
an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns related to 
his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran, and on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and citizenship of family members.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized response dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 19, 2005</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and initially requested a decision on the written record. On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 8, 2005, 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>January<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 20, 2006, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on </SPAN>February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 16, 2006, and 
the hearing was conducted on March 16, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit at the hearing (Exhibit A) 
and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN>March<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 30, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a., and  </SPAN>1.b.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline C and one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admissions are incorporated 
herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He received a Bachelor's degree in 
electrical engineering from a United States university and will receive a Master's Degree in Computer Science shortly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Iran. He came to the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 1978 with his family, and he became a </SPAN>United States citizen<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 1990. He is  married and has no children.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His wife was born in Iran and is 
now a dual citizen of Iran and the </SPAN>United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considers himself a dual citizen of Iran and the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He applied for an Iranian passport which was issued on March 7, 1996, even though he was a United States citizen. His wife 
obtained an extension on his Iranian passport in March 17, 2004, so that it would not expire until July 6, 2006. He traveled to Iran from June 19, 2004, until July 9, 2004, and he used his Iranian 
passport to enter and exit Iran( Exhibit 3). Applicant's</SPAN> wife still maintains her Iranian passport, and she has used it to travel to Iran in 1995 and 2000, as well as the trip in 2004.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>relinquish<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ed his Iranian passport in December 2005, by tearing it up and returning it  to the Embassy of Pakistan  (Exhibit A). However, at that time he did not communicate why he was 
returning his passport, nor did he take any affirmative step to</SPAN> renounce his Iranian citizenship (Tr at 34). </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing,  Applicant testified that he still desires to retain his Iranian citizenship (Tr at 44). Based on his retaining his Iranian <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens</SPAN>hip and failing to explain to the Iranian <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> that 
he did not desire to have an Iranian passport, it appears that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> may be able to apply for another Iranian passport in the future.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who 
are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens </SPAN>and residents of  Iran. They are in their 80s and are long retired. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She was a teacher, and he worked in an administrative position for the 
courts.</SPAN> They live half the year in Iran and half in the United States, and they live with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> two or more months every year when in the U. S. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> talks to them every two months when 
they are in Iran, and his wife talks to them at least one time a week <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 35)</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Iran in 2004, as discussed above. He has no set plans to return to Iran in the future <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 27, 29)</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account in 
reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent 
criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and 
surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the potential 
for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every 
case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and 
conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of 
witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified 
information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a security 
concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government raise 
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United 
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side 
of denials." Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, 
Section E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with respect to 
guidelines C and B:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's application and use of an Iranian passport, while a United 
States citizen, and his unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, which does allow him  the option of renewing his passport, must be considered adversely to Applicant and it raises serious 
Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. </P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A3.1.2.1.) applies because  Applicant's use of his Iranian passport after he became a United States citizen is a continuing example of Applicant's exercising dual 
citizenship. DC (E2.A3.1.2.2.) also applies because of Applicant's use of his Iranian passport. I find that because of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> stated unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, no 
itigating Condition (MC) applies in this case under Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation, are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. As Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law, with whom he has a self-described close personal relationship are citizens and residents of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to 
the Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes 
Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 
2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This, Applicant has not been able to do. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are  citizens and residents of Iran, comes within DC</SPAN> (E2.A2.1.2.1.), an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.  I can not find that MC (E2.A2.1.3.3.) applies because the contact between Applicant 
and his in-laws could not be described as limited, particularly since they live with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> two or more months every year.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence , I conclude that the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any mitigating evidence.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline C:  AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1. a.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2. Guideline B:  AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 2.a.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. </P>
