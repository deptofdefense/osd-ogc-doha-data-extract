<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to 
not grant a security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 
1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct).  The 
concern under both guidelines was based on falsification of material facts during a security interview.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 28, 2005, 
denied intentional falsification, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the 
Government's written case on November 17, 2005.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded 
an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on November 
23, 2005, and he did not submit any additional material.  The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, including Applicant's admissions in his response to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 28-year-old software developer for a federal contractor.  He graduated from college in December 1999 and was unemployed until February 2000, 
when he began working for a federal contractor in a computer support position.  He applied for a security clearance in March 2000, but his application was 
denied in December 2001.<A HREF="04-11704.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He began working for his current employer in September 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In preparation for his current position, he executed a SF 86 on August 28, 2002.  He was interviewed by a security investigator on April 12, 2004, and he 
executed a signed, sworn statement asserting he had never engaged in misuse of information technology systems, to include hacking, pirating, illegal or 
unauthorized downloads.<A HREF="04-11704.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In a second security interview on September 21, 2004, he admitted using a port scanner, "a sort of hacking device," while in college 
in 1999.  He used it to download MP3 files from the internet, connect to other individuals' computers, search for shared files, and access those of interest to 
him.  He did not know if the MP3 files were pirated, but he recognized the possibility they were.<A HREF="04-11704.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant repeated his admission 
of misusing information technology systems, but insisted it "slipped his mind" during the first security interview.<A HREF="04-11704.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 3) 
may apply when an applicant deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator or security 
official in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  Directive &para;E2.A5.11.2.3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is 
direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time of the omission.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 
2004). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits his statement of August 28, 2002 was false, but claims his computer hacking in 1999 "slipped his mind."  I find his explanation implausible 
and unconvincing.  He is a well-educated, mature adult.  He previously had submitted a security application and had been rejected.  He knew his first 
application had been subjected to close scrutiny.  He made a written, detailed, specific, categorical denial of computer hacking, and swore to it.  The hacking 
was not in his distant past, but occurred no more than three years before he executed his sworn statement.  His hacking was not a single, isolated, event, but a 
course of conduct involving a variety of activities.  It is implausible that his detailed, sworn denial of hacking did not trigger memory of his hacking activities in 
college.  I conclude DC 3 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant to this case.  MC 2 applies when the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  MC 3 applies when the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 
5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of establishing MC 2 or MC 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's falsification was "recent," because it 
occurred during his current security investigation.  He did not voluntarily provide the correct information.  He admitted his computer hacking only after he was 
questioned a second time by a security investigator. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline, I have also considered the seriousness of Applicant's conduct, his 
age and maturity at the time of his falsification, and the fact this case involves a single act of falsification rather than a course of conduct.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para;&para; 
E2.2.1.1. (nature, extent, and seriousness of conduct), E2.2.1.4. (age and maturity), E2.2.1.3. (frequency and recency of conduct).  His conduct is serious, as 
noted below under Guideline J.   His history of computer hacking especially was especially significant in assessing his suitability for a clearance, in light of his 
sensitive position as a software developer.  He is a well-educated, mature adult who should have understood the seriousness of providing false information 
during a security investigation.  On the other hand, a single falsification is less serious than a pattern of falsification, and the absence of repeated falsification is 
a somewhat mitigating condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on his false statement to a security investigator.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying 
condition may be based on allegations or an applicant's admission of criminal conduct, whether or not charged (DC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.  A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses may be disqualifying (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances 
are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A deliberately false answer in a security 
interview is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  For the reasons discussed above under Guideline E, I conclude Applicant has not refuted the 
allegation of falsification.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 1 and DC 2 under this guideline are established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing it was not recent (MC 1) or there is evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC 6).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1., 
E2.A10.1.3.6.  The issues under both MC 1 and MC 6 are whether there has been a significant period of time without any evidence of misconduct, and whether 
the evidence shows changed circumstances or conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Only with the passage of time will there be a track record that shows whether a person, through actions 
and conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the person has acted in the past."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 
1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  The sufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without 
recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather 
on a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case.  If the record evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without 
evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must articulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not demonstrate 
changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never held a security clearance, and his false statement occurred early in his career as a federal contractor.  He does not yet have a sufficient track 
record of trustworthiness to demonstrate rehabilitation or a low likelihood of recurring falsification. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I conclude he has not established MC 1 and MC 6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on criminal conduct also may be mitigated by showing the criminal behavior was "an isolated incident" (MC 2).  Directive 
&para;E2.A10.1.3.2.; <EM>see also </EM>Directive, &para; E2.2.1.3. (frequency and recency of conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  There is no other evidence of falsification in this record.  I conclude MC 2 
is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on his criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
