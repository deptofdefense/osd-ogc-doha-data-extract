<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July 14, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
(SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 18, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge LeRoy F. 
Foreman denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  Rather, it contains new evidence which establishes that 
Applicant has now paid off his sole remaining debt.  It also contains new evidence addressing concerns expressed by the Administrative Judge in his decision.  
The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is 
AFFIRMED.</P>
