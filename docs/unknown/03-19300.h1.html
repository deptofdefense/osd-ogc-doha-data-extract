<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns about foreign preference by turning in his passport and renouncing citizenship with Turkey. He mitigated concerns about 
foreign influence by establishing his excellent record as a holder of a security clearance for 15 years and his reputation for security awareness. Based on the 
whole person analysis, clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 18, 2004, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry 
</EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated December 8, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on June 20, 2005, and a Notice of Hearing was issued August 10, 2005, for a hearing held on August 29, 2005. The Government introduced five 
exhibits at the hearing and requested that administrative notice be taken of four government documents. The Applicant introduced 24 exhibits attached to his 
answer, and two more with multiple separately lettered appendages at the hearing. All were accepted into evidence. Four witnesses including his personal 
representative at the hearing testified for Applicant, and he testified on his own behalf. The transcript was received on September 28, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the specific facts in all allegations under Foreign Preference-Guideline C, and under Foreign Influence-Guideline B with explanatory 
information provided for each allegation. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record 
and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as an engineer. He was born in Turkey, served almost two years in the Turkish 
military, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1975 when he was 21 years old on a student visa when his former wife was a graduate student. He became a citizen in 
1989. His wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen from Turkey and he has two daughters by a former wife who are U.S. citizens.</P> 
<P>From the time of his arrival in the U.S. until 2000, with the exception of one nine month period, Applicant worked for a U.S. defense contractor owned by a 
Turkish-American. Applicant became vice president/engineering of the company and in 2000 it was sold to a major U.S. defense contractor for whom 
Applicant is still employed. As a result of his Turkish language skills and knowledge of the country, Applicant was sent by his employer to Turkey to work 
between 1994 and 2001 on a program supplying defense materiel under Defense Department contract with Turkey. He also worked in Saudi Arabia for 18 
months and Spain for two years for his employer on a similar program. He has held a security clearance for 15 years since 1990 and has held a NATO security 
clearance. </P> 
<P>His work overseas resulted in extra pay allowing him to accumulate capital. He had hoped to retire in 2001 but the turndown in the stock market changed his 
plans. Applicant has investments in the U.S. of over $700,000.00 and is financially secure. His only financial foreign interests are a private social security 
account that will begin paying him $200.00 per month this year and the likelihood of an inheritance of approximately $30,000.00 upon the death of his mother 
from the sale of property which he and his brother will inherit. In view of Applicant's total assets, these funds are not so significant as to raise security concerns. </P> 
<P>Applicant has been a dual citizen of the U.S. and Turkey, but turned in his Turkish passport to the Turkish embassy in April 2005 upon being advised of the 
process to do so. He had renewed his Turkish passport three times since becoming a U.S. citizen, but had not realized that the possession of the passport created 
security concerns until so advised by investigators in 2003. He began to take appropriate steps to relinquish it, but Turkish law made it difficult to do so. 
Subsequent changes in the law made it easier. His Turkish passport was used to enter and exit Turkey on his business trips which facilitated his travel but he 
also used his U.S. passport on many of his trips. He traveled to Turkey in 2002 and 2003 for personal reasons using only his U.S. passport. </P> 
<P>Applicant's mother, brother, and several in-laws live in Turkey. His mother is 78-years-old and lives in a nursing home. His brother is soon to be retired as a 
medical doctor working as a teacher and traveling abroad for the United Nations on health issues. Neither have any connections with the Turkish government. </P> 
<P>The fact that Applicant lived in Turkey for six years working for his employer was the result of needs and requirements of his company and the overseas pay he 
received rather than any deep seated desire to live in Turkey. In fact, both he and his wife were anxious to leave Turkey and return to the U.S. but the 
requirements of his employer dictated that they stay. Applicant's extensive and frequent travels for his company were responsible for his inability to secure 
citizenship in the U.S. as early as he desired since he could not fulfill the residence requirements earlier. </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his supervisor who testified on his behalf stating that he "has always handled sensitive information in a highly professional and 
correct manner"(TR. 40). A former supervisor stated that "his adherence to codes of conduct required of any U.S. corporation doing business in a foreign 
country was without exception" (Exh. Y-E). Both attested to his excellent work ethic, honesty, and dedication. He is well regarded by friends and family for his 
loyalty to them and his trustworthiness and sense of values. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an individual who acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country 
over the United States may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the exercise of dual citizenship (E2.A3.1.2.1.), and the possession and/or use of 
a foreign passport. Security concerns may be mitigated by a willingness to renounce dual citizenship (E2.A3.1.3.4.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant surrendered his Turkish passport to the Turkish Consul General in April 2005, and renounced his Turkish citizenship. He had not realized until 2003 
that his dual citizenship created security concerns since he had long held a security clearance while holding a Turkish passport. The government conceded that 
the passport issue was largely mitigated but expressed concern about the voluntary use of it in his trips to Turkey. However, Applicant's explanation of the 
reason for its use and the rationale for using it is reasonable since he was engaged in international defense sales and it's use facilitated his travels.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Possible mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination 
that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. 
(E2.A2.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has met that burden through application of the whole person test. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The family members of the Applicant in Turkey are his mother, brother, and several of his wife's relatives. None of them pose a security threat or are in a 
position to be influenced by the conduct of their government. None work for the Turkish government. Applicant does not have a close relationship with any 
except his mother and brother. Turkey is a trusted ally of the United States, a fact appreciated by the U.S. Government and factored into the decisions of 
Applicant in his work. His mother is infirm and his brother is independent of any likely influence that could be brought to bear on him. Difficulties that Turkey 
has with dissident groups largely is internal and unrelated to issues with the U.S., although some of those dissident groups have complaints directed at the U.S. 
(Exh. II). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a mature person who has a responsible position of trust and is doing an effective job for his company. He has spent his entire adult life since age 21 
in the U.S. He was educated in an American school in Turkey, and then embarked on a promising career path in the U.S. utilizing his language and Turkish 
heritage to further the interests of the U.S. defense community through the work of his company. He provided sincere, credible, and reliable testimony as to his 
relationships with his family, his motivations, his loyalty to the U.S. He provided both testimonial evidence and statements from present and former supervisors 
as to his security consciousness and adherence to security rules over a 15 year period. His is the classic story of the successful immigrant with drive and 
determination who succeeds and brings credit to the U.S.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P>
