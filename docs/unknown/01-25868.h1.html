<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On April 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>,
dated February 20, 1960 as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons under
Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant submitted a signed and sworn statement, dated May 12, 2003.  He admitted all the allegations contained in the SOR, and offered explanations and
justifications for his prior statements and actions.  Applicant requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On July 8, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to
Applicant.  He was given  the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  He received the FORM on July 24,
2003.  Applicant did not file a response to the FORM by the August 23, 2003 due date.  The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2003.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant is 27 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  Applicant has one daughter and two step-daughters.  Applicant served in the U.S. Army
and received an honorable discharge. (Item 5 at 1, 2, 5; Item 6; Item 7 at 1)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant smoked marijuana in 1991 and 1992.  While on active duty but without a security clearance Applicant smoked marijuana on December 27 and 30,
1997.  Applicant was on leave at that time. (Item 4; Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 1 and 2; Item 7 at 3; Item 10 at 2)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant received an Article 15, non-judicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, on June 15, 1998, for wrongfully possessing marijuana
in his dormitory room in January, 1998.  The marijuana was in an article of clothing in his locker. (Item 9)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant deliberately answered Question 27 falsely on his security clearance application by denying any illegal use of drugs in the past seven years from June
3, 1999, when Applicant signed that application.  In fact, Applicant had used marijuana twice in 1997.  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this marijuana
use during interviews with Defense Security Service investigators in 1999 and 2002, by denying such use at least three times.  Applicant later admitted such use
and blamed his forgetfulness for the omission of information.  Applicant feared he would not be able to get a security clearance and retain his job with he
disclosed his marijuana use. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6;</P>

<P>Item 7 at 1 and 3)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant's manager counseled Applicant for making false statements relating to his non-selection for promotion within his company.  This counseling
occurred on or about May 31, 2002.  Applicant was also counseled by the same person for his poor attendance and tardiness on or about May 16, 2002. 
Applicant asserted his need to care for his wife and new baby, and the working of a second job to provide income for his family as the reasons for his tardiness
and unauthorized absences.  Applicant was also counseled on or about October 10, 2001 for tardiness by reporting for work at 10:40 a.m. when his work start
time was 7:30 a.m. (Item 8 at all)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant violated federal law by knowingly and willfully providing false information on the security clearance application and to two federal investigators. 
These violations were of Title 18, United States Code, &sect;1001.  These violations, if prosecuted, would constitute a felony offense under federal law. (Item 5 at 7;
Item 6 at all; Item 7 at 1 and 3)</P>

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id</EM>. At 527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability,
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </P>

<P>(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; </P>

<P>(3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; </P>

<P>(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; </P>

<P>(5) the voluntariness of participation; </P>

<P>(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; </P>

<P>(7) the motivation for the conduct; </P>

<P>(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and </P>

<P>(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify,
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  See <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001). 
Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts.  See Directive Para E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive Para. E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,
on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec . Or. 12968 Section 3.1(b).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(A) Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or
dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(B) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances and include: </P>

<P>(2) Inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in the record as evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal requirements, factors, and conditions cited above, I
conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Guideline H - Drug Involvement: I conclude the Government established its case by the record evidence and the admissions of the Applicant.  Applicant used
marijuana three times within the time period required for disclosure by the security clearance application Question 27.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 2
apply.  The Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1 and 3 apply here.  The marijuana use was not recent, the last incident of smoking was in December, 1997, and the
last possession accusation was in 1998.  Applicant's new child, marital and family obligations, and his express statements about no future drug use, and his
move from his former residence in another state and away from his former environment, all demonstrate to me that Applicant will not be a user of illicit drugs
in the future.  The finding is for the Applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Applicant did not make the required and appropriate full disclosure, even when asked several times and given an opportunity
to provide the information.  Applicant cited his fear for his job and the need for a clearance as the reasons for his mendacity.  I do not find his reasons
persuasive or credible.  Under this guideline, a security concern may exist if an applicant is shown to be untrustworthy, dishonest, lacking in candor, dishonest
in his disclosures, and failing to comply with requirements of disclosure.  Applicant had two interviews in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and did not voluntarily
disclose the required information until confronted by the investigator. DC 2, 4, and 5 apply.  I cannot find any Mitigating Conditions which apply here.  The
finding is against the Applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct: The Government established its case here.  Applicant has a pattern established of criminal conduct which calls into question
his judgement.  DC 1 and 2 apply here.  I do not apply any MC here because I can find none which are applicable.  The finding is against the Applicant.</P>
