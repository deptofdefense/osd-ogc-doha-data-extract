<P>While Applicant's financial problems stemming from his wife's business problems and his subsequent divorce raised security concerns, he has resolved his 
debts to multiple creditors and mitigated those concerns by paying one creditor and discharging the other debts in bankruptcy in December 2002.  He has one 
state tax debt he has yet to resolve, but Applicant  demonstrated that conditions largely beyond his control led to this debt due to his efforts to try to help his 
wife in her business and the subsequent divorce stipulations. While Applicant still owes over $11,000 to the state, he has presented a plan to resolve this debt.  
Thus, he has demonstrated that he is making a "good faith" effort to pay this debt.  Applicant also mitigated personal conduct concerns over his financial 
disclosures in his security application.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 23, 2002.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-16934.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  Applicant responded to 
these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on November 12, 2002; he denied all the allegations in part and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on December 6, 2002, stated it was ready to proceed; and the case was assigned to another administrative 
judge, Wilford Ross.  On December 16, 2002, the case was re-assigned to me.  Subsequently, after a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to, a 
Notice of Hearing issued on January 7, 2003, set the matter for January 29, 2003, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the 
Government offered into evidence four Government exhibits; all were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits 1-4) The Applicant represented himself, testified, and 
offered eight exhibits which were admitted into evidence.  (Exhibits A-H)  Applicant requested an additional week to submit additional documents; as the 
Government did not object, I allowed him until February 5, 2003, to submit additional evidence to the Department Counsel.  She then was allowed three days to 
review it and submit it to me by February 10, 2003.  (TR 79-81) He submitted two additional exhibits (Exhibits I &amp; J) in a timely fashion; on February 6, 2002,  
the Department Counsel stated she had no objection to their being admitted into evidence. Exhibits I &amp; J were admitted into evidence and the record closed.  
The transcript (TR) was received on February 8, 2003.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>    </P> 
<P>Applicant, 42 years old, has been an employee of Defense Contractor #1 since January 2000.  In February 2001 he applied for a security clearance by 
completing a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   (Exhibit 1)</P> 
<P>Applicant received a BS degree for a state university in December 1980.  He was married in June 1993, but separated from his spouse in March 1999.  They 
have one child born in 1995.  (Exhibit 1; TR 40) They entered a written Marital Settlement Agreement and were divorced in August 2001.  (Exhibit D)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Finances</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Before he was married, Applicant had a very good credit rating and a good income.  (TR 45, 58-59)</P> 
<P>While Applicant was married, he and his spouse developed financial problems that he attributed to the "bad business practices" from his wife's business.  In 
1998 he left his professional career to try to help his wife with her business as it was a partnership, but she continued to have business difficulties.  
Subsequently, he stopped trying to help her and re-entered his field.  He obtained a job in his field in another state before he was able to get a position with 
Company #1.   His wife opened another business in her own name.  In March 2000 Applicant's wife and her business filed Chapter 7 petitions for Bankruptcy.   
(Exhibit 2, TR 17-25; 42, 47, 49-50, 58-61, 65-66; Exhibits A, D, E)   </P> 
<P>The couple used their own personal finances to pay for the business expenses, so debts reflected in SOR 1. a. through 1.l. are mostly debts related to the 
business and date from 1995.  Initially, he and his wife did consult consumer credit counseling (CCC) and also re-financed their house in order to address the 
debts.  Some of the credit card debts were acquired while he was separated for expenses such as repair of his 1991 car which has over 153,000 miles.  He has 
some savings to be able to replace it and for emergencies. (TR 43-44, 52-58, 67, 72)</P> 
<P>Over the past four years since he separated from his wife, Applicant has paid many  creditors that were not listed in the SOR.  His wife kept the records on the 
creditors, so it was difficult to document the exact nature of all of the debts.  (TR 47-48)</P> 
<P>Initially, Applicant did not want to file for bankruptcy, so that was one of the reasons for the separation from his wife.  Also he stated that his wife could 
generate more debt than he could contain.  After he and his wife separated in 1999, his wife continued to run her jewelry business, but decided she would not 
pay taxes.  Because he helped his wife prepare the payroll, he was also held liable by the state.  As part of the August 2001 divorce proceedings, each party was 
to be responsible for each of their debts, but part of the proceeds from the sale of their house went to pay a business tax debt of approximately $57,000.  Each 
were to be responsible for half of the remaining state tax liability as a result of non-payment of certain retailers and occupation sales tax and payroll withholding 
tax associated with a business.  Applicant was charged with responsibility for this debt of $11,500 to State #1 relating to taxes, penalties and interest due to his 
spouse's business.(SOR 1.n.) (Exhibit 2, TR 17-25, 35-42, 46-47, 49, 62-65, 74; Exhibits A, D, E)  A December 2001 Settlement Agreement with the 
Department of Revenue stipulated that Applicant and his wife would be jointly and severally liable for all taxes incurred by the jewelry business from 1997 to 
1999.  (Exhibit I)</P> 
<P>According to the August 2001 Marital Settlement Agreement, Applicant is to pay $76.50 per week for child support. (Exhibits D, I; TR 80-81) His child 
support is deducted directly from his salary.  (Exhibit I)</P> 
<P>In March 2002 DOHA sent an Interrogatory to ask Applicant to further explain his finances and debts to twelve creditors.   At that point he paid some of the 
creditors and was trying to negotiate with his other creditors to resolve the debts and was also considering bankruptcy to resolve his debts.  He was saving 20% 
of his salary in order to be able to resolve his debts.   (Exhibit 4)  In June 2002 his monthly net income was over $3,000, his monthly expenses approximately 
$2,300 and he was making no payments on his debts, so had a remainder of over $700.  He explained to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in June 2002 that 
he planned to file for bankruptcy. (Exhibit 2, TR 17-25, 69;  Exhibits A, D, E)  He explained he only used some of this excess money to pay his listed debts as 
he need to save money for emergencies.  (TR 70-71) </P> 
<P>Applicant  filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy in August 2002 and listed creditors and debts that totaled $27,196.  He paid one of the small debts (SOR 
1.m.), but the remainder of  his debts listed in the SOR were discharged under Section 727 of Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy Code) in 
December 2002.  (TR 19-21, 33-36; Exhibits B &amp; C) </P> 
<P>He has a 401K which he began in January 2002, but he has had to take loans from that asset to pay lawyers and other debts.  The only way he is able to save is 
by putting in substantial overtime. He will pay his loans against his 401 K in 2003.  (TR 50-51, 67-68) Currently, he has two credit cards which are tied to his 
business account and which are paid off regularly.  (TR 67) In 2002 his salary was $93,000, part of it from overtime. (TR 68)  For 2001 his US Individual 
Income Tax Return reflects adjusted gross income of $87,000; for 2000, $72,000; and for 1999, $40,000.  (Exhibit J) He has a 401K plan and retirement 
benefits worth $46,000 with a prior employer and a "SIP" worth $14,000 with Company #1. His current monthly net income is approximately $2,600 and his 
monthly expenses are approximately $2,600.  He expects a raise in September 2003.  (Exhibit I)  His expenses in January 2003 approximately equaled his 
income; he even stopped using cable to cut his expenses.  (TR 71) He now does everything he can to economize, even going to a dollar store to save on his 
expenses.  (TR 73) He has not incurred any new debt since his divorce. (TR 85)</P> 
<P>Applicant is in the process of resolving the $11,500 tax liability issue with State #1; however,  in September 2002 State #1 Board of Appeals dismissed his 
appeal until the completion of his bankruptcy proceedings.  He could not negotiate with them until his other debts were discharged in bankruptcy in December 
2002.  In January 2003 he filed a petition with State #1 to resolve the matter making an offer in compromise of $3,500.  (TR 75-79; Exhibits E, I)</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>While Applicant did not disclose all of the details of his financial problems on his 2001 SF 86, he did disclose the full financial details in documents to security 
personnel at Company #1 and to the DSS in his interview.  A company security official confirmed that Applicant had advised them of all of his credit problems, 
but the company did not list them fully in the security form as they were aware that DSS would run a credit check.  He had no intent to falsify his SF 86.  
(Exhibits 1, 2, Exhibits E, F H; TR 10-11, 16-17, 22-23, 25-26, 28-33)</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P> 
<P>1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations; </P> 
<P>3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </P> 
<P>3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);  </P> 
<P>4.  The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E</STRONG> <STRONG>- Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2)  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4)  Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted 
information was promptly and fully provided.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has (1) a history of financial problems and has shown (3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts.  Applicant and his former wife used 
their own personal finances to pay for the jewelry business expenses.  Debts reflected in SOR 1. a. through 1.l. are mostly debts related to the business and date 
from 1995.  Some of the credit card debts were acquired after he separated in 1999.  As part of the divorce agreement in August 2001 and a December 2001 
Settlement with the state, he was held liable for $11,500 (50% of the state taxes unpaid by his wife's business) which remains an outstanding liability.</P> 
<P>By a bankruptcy discharge in December 2002, Applicant effectively mitigated the SOR allegations concerning his debts alleged in SOR 1.a through 1.l.; he paid 
the creditor listed in SOR 1.m.  By discharging legally or by paying those debts, Applicant met mitigating conditions (MC<A HREF="01-16934.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>) for those debts.  While he has yet 
to resolve the state tax debt (SOR 1.n.), Applicant demonstrated that conditions largely beyond his control led to this tax debt due to his wife's business 
problems, his efforts to help her, and the subsequent divorce. While Applicant still owes over $11,000 to the state, he has presented a plan to resolve this debt.  
Thus, he has demonstrated under MC 6 that he is making a "good faith" effort to pay this debt as he has filed a petition with the state and made an offer to pay 
this tax debt.  Further, while he initially was slow to resolve these debts, he testified convincingly of his continuing efforts to find a plan to resolve them and his 
ultimate decision to seek a resolution through bankruptcy.  He does not live extravagantly and now lives within his means.  Significantly, he has not incurred 
any new debt since his divorce. Thus under MC 4, there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. </P> 
<P>Applicant has a good income, has had a stable job since January 2000, and presented evidence that he is highly regarded in the workplace.  For example, the 
lead project engineer stated that he was very satisfied with Applicant's work ethic and character.  He is a important part of the design team, and he recommends 
Applicant for a security clearance. While ideally he should develop a longer track record of success, I found his continuing efforts since his 1999 separation to 
resolve these debts credible.  Looking at the whole person and the special circumstances that led to the debts, I conclude he now meets the high standards 
needed to gain access to classified information.  Therefore, Applicant is now in a position to be financially responsible.  He has conscientiously worked to 
improve his financial situation.  With an income of $93,000 in 2002 and his willingness to work overtime, I conclude he has demonstrated that he is in a 
position to act with fiscal control and responsibility in the future.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. through 1.o under SOR Paragraph 1 as I conclude that he has mitigated these financial concerns.    </P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>While failures to disclose all of his financial difficulties on a 2001 SF 86 led the Government to raise security concerns over personal conduct issues, at the 
hearing the Department Counsel conceded that Applicant had mitigated<A HREF="01-16934.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> this concern. Both in a submission to his employer and in the DSS interview, he 
disclosed all of his financial difficulties.  (Exhibits 2 &amp; E)  Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsifications before being confronted with 
the facts.  Hence, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for  Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. 
under SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
