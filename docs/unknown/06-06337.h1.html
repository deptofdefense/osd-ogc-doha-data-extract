<P>On October 19, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), changing the reference from Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel 
Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended to DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant did not object to the amendment. I granted Department Counsel's motion.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 2, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  On June 21, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to him, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR 
detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, notarized answer, dated August 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  On September 19, 2006, the case was 
assigned to me.  The hearing was held in Arlington, Virginia on October 19, 2006 (R. 1, 3).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on October 31, 2006.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that he was  responsible for the six debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  His 
response to the SOR indicated the debt in SOR <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 1.a </SPAN>for $96.00 was disputed, and then at the hearing he provided a receipt dated October 6, 2006, showing this debt was paid on May 30, 2000.  The 
other five SOR debts  became delinquent when his salary became insufficient to pay his debts due to the increase in the size of his family.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 35-years-old, and has been employed by the United States government or as a United States government contractor since March 1993.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  From 1991 to 1992, he attended college, but 
did not receive a degree.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He was married on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February 4, 1996.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  His children are ten, seven and three years of age, and his youngest child was born in 2003.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  
After his second child was born, his wife left her job and became a full-time homemaker (R. 23).  In the late 1990s his debts began to become delinquent because his salary was only about 
$30,000.00 per year (R. 23).  In August 2004, he began to work for his current employer with annual pay of $58,000.00 (R. 23-24).  Once he began working for his current employer his debt load 
stabilized, and his car payments, utilities and credit card were kept current (R. 53-54).  In 2005, his pay was $65,000.00 and in 2006 it was $71,000.00 per year (R. 24).</SPAN></P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER>In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory</CENTER> 
 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay his debts is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to sensitive government information.  
Regulation, Appendix 8, clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy his outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debt in SOR &para; 1.a was paid on May 30, 2000, and there is no evidence that it was delinquent.  The five debts listed in 
SOR &para;&para; 1.b to 1.f were delinquent for a substantial period of time and are discussed briefly below.  </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to his five failures to meet his financial obligations, and his admission that he was unable to pay his debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent for several 
years.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden 
of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  In September 12, 2006, his employer provided a debt consolidation loan, 
which resulted in payment of the debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.b to 1.f.  Based on evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple 
(five) delinquent SOR debts.  Payment of the five debts so recently, well after he received the SOR, and shortly before his hearing is simply too recent to merit full application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all five SOR debts at issue because the debts became delinquent several years ago and were the result of the increase in the size of his family and his under employment 
(from  1999 to 2004).  Underemployment and change in family circumstances are good examples of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3 as causes of financial problems that 
may be "largely beyond the person's control."  I conclude that Applicant's statement about how his debts became delinquent is credible and sufficient to provide some credit under FC MC 3 in 
regard to his debts.  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because he waited until September 2006 to resolve or make progress on these five SOR debts.  The impact of his 
underemployment is somewhat reduced by his steady growth in pay, especially after starting with his current employer in 2004.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how he  endeavored to pay 
or resolve his debts prior to September 2006.  However, his recent resolution of his debts, warrants significant credit and I am confident that he is on the right track now towards correction of his 
financial problems.  </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 4 applies because there is sufficient evidence that he has had recent financial counseling, and there are clear indications (since September 2006) that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith prior to September 2006 in the resolution of his debts.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He has not provided 
sufficient information about how he attempted to resolve or repay her debts from 1999 until  September 2006.  He does, however, merit partial credit for his recent efforts through a debt 
consolidation program to repay his creditors, which is a legal means for resolving these five debts.<A HREF="06-06337.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Reduction in his debts will substantially reduce his potential vulnerability to improper financial 
inducements.        </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet his financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. He is currently 
35 years old, but was in his 20's when his delinquent debts first became a problem.  He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.  His actions in generating or failing to resolve

underemployment and the growth of his family.  He made decisions to use his money for his spouse and children, rather than paying his five creditors.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation,

his payment of his creditors. </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low-Applicant is current on his debts, and his income has increased substantially. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> These changes will
