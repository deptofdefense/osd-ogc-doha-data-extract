<P>Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. When Applicant was 23 years old he was arrested and convicted of trafficking cocaine. He was 
sentenced to and served three years in prison. Since Applicant's arrest he has dedicated himself to turning life around and he has been successful. Applicant has 
led an exemplary life. He is a valued family man, employee, and member of the community. Applicant is successfully rehabilitated. However, mitigation of the 
disqualifying condition is not sufficient to grant Applicant a security clearance. Under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, absent a waiver, the Defense 
Department cannot grant a security clearance TO any person convicted and sentenced in any court in the United States for a crime and incarcerated as a result of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which are in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated December 16, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted 
both allegations under Guideline J, criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on August 10, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on August 29, 2005, scheduling the hearing for September 13, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6. The exhibits were admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, had eleven witnesses testify on his behalf, and submitted seven exhibits that were 
marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-G. They were admitted into the record without objection. The decision in this case involves Title 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (the 
Smith Amendment). The transcript was received on September 21, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 40 years old, married and has a daughter and a stepdaughter. Applicant and his wife have been married 9 years and she works for the police 
department in the city where they live. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was previously married and divorced. His biological daughter lives with her mother. Applicant pays child support and has never been delinquent in 
payments. Applicant is an engineering technician and has worked for a federal contractor since 2003. Prior to then he worked for the same employer from 1996 
to 2003 and was steadily employed since 1993.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While in high school Applicant became involved with people who had a negative influence on him. Applicant admitted to hanging around with the wrong 
crowd and he refused to accept the advice of his family and friends. Applicant used illegal drugs from 1979 to 1988. He illegally purchased drugs and sold 
drugs. Applicant's last involvement with drugs was in 1988 when he was arrested for selling drugs to an undercover agent. He was 23 years old at that time. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on September 9, 1988, and charged with three counts of violation of State A's Uniform Controlled Substance Act (felonies). The 
charges involved a single transaction. On May 21, 1990, Applicant pled guilty to and was adjudged guilty of one count of Trafficking in Cocaine, a felony. The 
other offenses were nolle prosequi. On July 19, 1990, Applicant was sentenced to three years in the State Penitentiary, fined $50,000.00, and ordered to pay 
approximately $50.00 to the Victim Compensation Assessment, and $756.00 in court costs. Applicant was incarcerated from July 19, 1990 to May 30, 1993. 
Applicant was awarded two months credit for incarceration time he previously served. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After being arrested Applicant intentionally did not accept his family's offer to have him released on bond because he wanted time to think about his life, where 
it was going, and to clean himself up. He was released two months later on bond pending the disposition of his case. From the time he was released until he was 
incarcerated Applicant maintained a job and did not get into any trouble. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While in prison, Applicant went through intensive rehabilitation, including a 12-step program for drug abuse. Applicant was moved from different penal 
facilities and assisted the coordinators of various rehabilitation programs while in prison. He eventually was permitted to serve his time in a minimum security 
facility, on a work release program where he would complete community service during the day and be incarcerated at night. Applicant was a model prisoner 
and took advantage of all the rehabilitative and educational programs that were offered. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon Applicant's release from prison in May 1993, he reapplied to work with his previous employer. Although the employer was not hiring, he was offered a 
job by the supervisor because he was known to be a hard worker, very fair, and got along with co-workers. Applicant was promoted and became a supervisor 
over approximately 20-25 people. Applicant moved jobs in 2003 for better opportunities. Applicant's employers know of his conviction and prison time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant readily admits that the best thing that ever happened to him was being arrested. It turned his life around. Applicant is a welder by trade and assists the 
local high school's teachers. Specifically he provides expert advice to the welding technology classes. He also serves on numerous advisory committees with 
the high school and is generous with his free time to help the students. Applicant is not shy about sharing his experiences with the students so they hopefully 
will not make the same mistakes he did. Applicant also devoted his time to completing the required college courses in emergency medical technology, standard 
first aid, and adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The attorney who prosecuted Applicant testified on his behalf. He believes Applicant is a good person who became involved with the wrong crowd. He believes 
Applicant turned himself around by applying for every educational opportunity available while in prison. The prosecutor kept track of Applicant's progress 
while in prison. He specifically remembers Applicant because he was very forthright in admitting he had committed the offense he was charged with. Applicant 
wanted to plead guilty and get on with his life. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant leads a healthy lifestyle. He rarely drinks alcohol and surrounds himself with only his family and a few close trusted friends. He no longer associates 
with people from his past that were involved in drugs. He is devoted to his wife, daughter, and stepdaughter. He has not used any illegal drugs since his arrest in 
1988. Applicant is dedicated to his job and the community. Applicant's family, friends and employers know of his past. Many had serious reservations 
regarding Applicant when he was released from prison. However, Applicant has proved to be sincere and genuine in his rehabilitation. Applicant has also 
proven himself to be a good father figure and provides an exemplary example to his children. Applicant is considered honest, trustworthy, reliable and well-liked by a myriad of people from different segments of the community, including, work, school, and social services, to name a few. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant takes his work seriously and although he does not presently hold a security clearance, he is required at times to be escorted into a restricted secure 
area to conduct work. He is required to follow certain guidelines while in those areas and not wander. Applicant resolutely complies with all the access rules. In 
addition, he is equally resolute in complying with all safety standards and regulations, as well as all time card and other administrative requirements. 
Applicant's work ethic is outstanding and he is seen not only as an expert at his craft, but a visionary in seeking and developing solutions for difficult problems. 
He is the "go to" guy when these problems arise and is sought after to be on the "A" Team to get the job done. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided numerous character letters and numerous character witnesses testified. All were fully aware of Applicant's past and praised his current 
lifestyle and commitment to his family, community and work. He maintains an outstanding reputation in the community and is considered trustworthy, reliable, 
responsible and rehabilitated. Applicant's successful rehabilitation and reformation was recognized by State A when Applicant was granted a pardon with 
restoration of civil rights and political rights on April 23, 2003.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline J, criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, applies in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial 
commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of 
the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. 
Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Once 
the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06807.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged)</EM>, and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>apply. Applicant was arrested, charged 
with, and convicted of trafficking cocaine, a felony. He admitted his guilt, was sentenced, and served three years in prison.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent);</EM> CC MC E2.10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident);</EM>CC MC E2.10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur)</EM>; and CC MC E2.10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.)</EM>. I conclude all of the above 
mitigating conditions apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted he associated with the wrong people when he was arrested and charged with trafficking cocaine. This conduct happened when he was 23 
years old, over 17 years ago, and is not recent. Applicant has not been in any trouble since that time. To the contrary, he has led an exemplary life. Applicant's 
mistake, although serious, was an isolated incident. Applicant no longer associates with the people from his life before he went to prison and none of the factors 
that influenced him are likely to recur. Applicant made a conscious and deliberate decision when he was arrested to change his ways. In Applicant's case it was 
not a fleeting thought, but rather he took notable action to rehabilitate himself and he has been completely successful. Applicant took responsibility for his 
wrongdoing, served his sentence and became a responsible, valuable member of the community. He epitomizes what the penal system strives for in a 
rehabilitated person, so much so he was granted a pardon by the state that convicted him. There is overwhelming evidence of Applicant's successful 
rehabilitation. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, a federal statute was enacted that prohibited the Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance for any applicant who was 
convicted of an offense in a U.S. court and was sentenced to more than one year in jail. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (c)(1) (2001). "In a meritorious case," the Secretary of 
Defense could authorize an exception to the prohibition. The Secretary was not authorized to delegate that authority. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(d) (2001). In June 2001, 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing guidance for processing cases under the statute. In response, the Director, DOHA, directed that, in cases 
in which the decision to deny or revoke a security clearance is based solely on 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge "shall include without explanation" a 
statement recommending or not recommending further consideration of the case for a waiver of the prohibition. DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64 &para; 3.e (Jul. 
10, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As amended in 2004, the prohibition on granting security clearances to applicants who have been convicted in U.S. courts was limited to those who are 
sentenced to more than one year in jail and were incarcerated as a result of that conviction for at least one year. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1) (2004). The waiver 
provision was also amended. It now provides that an exception to the prohibition on granting a clearance may be authorized "[i]n a meritorious case, . . . if there 
are mitigating factors. Any such waiver may be authorized only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an 
Executive order or other guidance issued by the President." 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(d) (2004). No such executive order or other guidance has been issued by, or under 
the authority of, the President.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the Director's direction in DOHA Operating Instruction 64 that the administrative judge make a recommendation whether the statute's 
prohibitions should be waived, the Appeal Board has concluded that, under the 2004 amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the administrative judge has </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">no authority to make a waiver recommendation. According to [the amendments], any waiver decision 'may be authorized only in accordance with standards and 
procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance issued by the President.' Without such standards and procedures, the 
Judge had no legal authority to make any recommendation, favorable or unfavorable, concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 03-05804 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2005).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I disagree with the Appeal Board's conclusion. The Appeal Board conflated making a recommendation to waive with making a decision to waive. The 
amendment limits the authority to grant a waiver, not to recommend whether a waiver should or should not be granted. Nevertheless, I am not at liberty to 
disregard the Appeal Board's decision even though I disagree with it. ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2004). However, to avoid the 
possibility of a remand if guidance is later issued by or under the authority of the President, I believe it is appropriate to note what my recommendation would 
have been had I the authority to make one. Recognizing my recommendation is not binding on the waiver authority, I would have recommended further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
