<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 9, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be 
granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated June 17, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. On September 9, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
filed no response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 27, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-6), which were admitted without objection.

There is no evidence 
how much he has paid on this overdue debt.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant explained that his debts resulted from several factors. These  included: 1) he and his wife were living above their means, primarily with credit cards; 
2) he was laid off from his job, was unemployed for a period of time, and his subsequent employment did not pay him as well; 3) his three stepchildren came to 
live with him and his wife, which increased his debt significantly (Exhibit 6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.2.3 Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's<STRONG> </STRONG>control (e.g., loss of employment, a business<EM> </EM>downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>              </STRONG>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guideline F:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and his current non-payment of all 
of the debts listed on the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3., because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations and his inability to satisfy his debts. Regarding Mitigating Condition (MC) 
E2.A6.1.3.3, which regards debts that result from circumstances beyond the person's control,  I find it applicable to this case, but not controlling. While 
Applicant's indebtedness was partially due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> career problems and the fact that his three step children 
came to live with Applicant and his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was wife, Applicant's debts also occurred as a result of his own conduct of financial irresponsibility. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Until Applicant can satisfy his overdue debts and establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will continue to exist under 
Guideline F.  I resolve Guideline F. against Applicant, and I conclude Applicant has not established, at this time, that it is "clearly consistent with the national 
interest" that he should be granted the privilege of a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
