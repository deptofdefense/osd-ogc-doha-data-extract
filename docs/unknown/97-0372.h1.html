<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>On May 19, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense Industrial</EM>
<EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 31, 1997 and requested a hearing before
a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on July 1, 1997. 
On July 28, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly
consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security
clearance.  The Government's case consisted of four exhibits, Applicant relied on three exhibits and
on his own testimony.  Applicant supplemented the record with an additional exhibit after the
conclusion of the hearing.  This exhibit was accepted into evidence without objection by Department
Counsel.  A transcript of the proceedings was received on August 6, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	In his answer to the Statement of Reasons, Applicant admitted all factual allegations set forth
under paragraph 1 (Criterion G) except subparagraph 1.m., and all of the factual allegations set forth
under paragraph 2 (Criterion H).  Applicant denied the two factual allegations set forth under
paragraph 3 (Criterion E) but admitted the single, factual allegation set forth under paragraph
4<A HREF="97-0372.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>(Criterion J).  Applicant's admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.  After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make
the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 43 year-old employee of a defense contractor who is attempting to obtain a
secret clearance.  Although he had served in the United States Army from 1977 to 1981, there is no
evidence in the record that he has previously held a security clearance.  His suitability for a security
clearance has been called into question because of alcohol consumption, drug involvement, personal
conduct and criminal conduct.</P>

<P>	Applicant began consuming alcohol regularly in 1971 when he was 17 years old.  As he
recalls in "(his) Story," (Gov. Exh. 3), he began drinking because he felt inadequate.  He did not
believe that he "fit in with other kids"; he felt that he was "dumb, ugly and not liked by other
people."  Because alcohol helped him to overcome these feelings and enabled him to experience
happiness for the first time, he continued to indulge--on weekends at first, but gradually his
weekends became longer and eventually, he was drinking alcohol daily.  He was arrested for DWI
the first time in 1974-75.<A HREF="97-0372.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  He was fined $50.00 and ordered not to drive in State X for six months. 
At that point his parents told him to get help for his problem, or to move out of the house.  When he
realized what it would cost to rent an apartment, he decided to try Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). 
He attended one meeting and concluded that he did not have a problem with alcohol "like the other
people" at the meeting (Gov. Exh. 3).  Because he continued to drink, his parents told him to move
out.<A HREF="97-0372.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	After he moved out of his parent's home, Applicant's alcohol consumption increased to the
point where he was drinking a 12 pack of beer every day, and "going through jobs" every three or
four months.  He was arrested for DWI again in 1977; he was fined $250.00 and his license was
revoked.  In October 1978, Applicant joined the Army.  He reduced his alcohol consumption while 
he was attending a difficult training program at one of the service's technical schools.  After he
realized that he could not keep up with his classes and continue to drink, he sought counseling and
was put on antabuse.  He continued in the counseling program and stayed on antabuse until he
finished the training program.  Applicant then stopped taking antabuse, stopped participating in the
counseling program, and celebrated the completion of a difficult course.  He was sent overseas and
resumed drinking alcohol on a daily basis.  He was eventually discharged--with an honorable
discharge--for drug and alcohol abuse on August 5, 1981.</P>

<P>	Applicant returned to the United States and continued to abuse alcohol.  En route to his home
immediately after being discharged, he was arrested for DWI and driving without a license on
August 7, 1981.  Two days later, he was arrested again for burglary, vehicle theft, and larceny from
an automobile.  He had consumed alcohol before this arrest.  Shortly after these arrests, Applicant
entered a 21 day alcohol treatment program.  After completing the inpatient portion of the treatment
at Facility G, he was referred to VA Hospital O and then to a Half-way House Z for additional
treatment.  He was discharged from the half-way house because he returned late one night
intoxicated.  </P>

<P>	On December 31, 1981, Applicant went to court and was sentenced for the offenses
committed on August 7 and 9, 1981. After spending all of 1982 in jail, he was released on February
14, 1983.</P>

<P>	After a brief period of sobriety following his release from jail, Applicant began drinking
heavily again.  In July 1983, he sought help from County X General Hospital.  He was referred to
a long term (18 month) rehabilitation program at another facility.  Applicant remained in that
program for three months before walking away from the program shortly before Thanksgiving 1983. 
He was on the street drinking again.  It was winter and he was cold so he went to social services. 
They gave him a bus ticket for VA Hospital Q--in another state.  He completed the 28 day inpatient
treatment program and was discharged to Half-way House Z for additional treatment.  He moved out
of House Z in April and into a rooming house; he attended AA meetings for a while.  He gradually
began drinking again, and by the summer of 1986, he was back in the General Detox Facility of the
County X General Hospital.  From there he was referred to another 28 day rehabilitation program
at Facility H.  He was asked to leave the treatment program after two weeks because of a rules
violation.  He moved in with a female friend and got a better job.  He reduced his alcohol
consumption considerably but would still get drunk once or twice a year when the woman with
whom he was living left town.  This lifestyle and drinking pattern continued until April 1988 when
he was arrested for another DWI.  After this DWI, he lost his job, his car, and his drivers license.<A HREF="97-0372.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> 
The court sentenced Applicant to 45 days in a pre-release program as a result of the DWI.</P>

<P>	Because the woman with whom he had been living left the area in 1992 to care for her ailing
mother in another state, Applicant had to find an alternative living arrangement.  He moved into a
sober house, began attending AA meetings regularly, and was assigned a sponsor.  Applicant lived
there for a year and a half and worked at a regular job.  In the fall of 1994, he moved out of the sober
house and into a house owned by his employer.  He began working longer hours and did not have
time to attend AA meetings.  He began to drink again during lunch breaks and after work.  In July
1995, Applicant quit his job after a dispute with his employer.  There is no evidence to dispute his
claim that he was sober at the time.  However, he began drinking heavily after leaving this
employment because he was nervous and did not know what would happen to him--where he would
end up.  He could not find another job; it was near the end of the month; and he did not have money
for the rent.</P>

<P>	On July 31, 1995, Applicant asked the person--who was already his sponsor--for help.  His
sponsor suggested that he go through the treatment program at Facility B.  Applicant accepted this
advice and was admitted to Facility B on August 3, 1995 (Gov. Exh. 4).  The admitting diagnosis
was: "Alcohol dependence, continuous" and "Cannabis dependence, continuous."  Applicant
completed the program on August 28, 1995 and was discharged--with a guarded prognosis-- to
Halfway House Z where he remained until January 1, 1996.  He then moved into a sober house
where he has been living with three roommates who are all involved in AA.</P>

<P>	In addition to abusing alcohol, Applicant has also abused illegal drugs.  He first used 
marijuana in 1970.  From that time until July 31, 1995, there were occasions when he abused
marijuana daily as an alternative to alcohol.  He used marijuana because "it seemed like marijuana
replaced (his) craving for alcohol," "it seemed like a better high," and he "didn't have the hangovers
and troubles drinking brought on" (Gov. Exh 2).  While Applicant was abusing marijuana, he was
also purchasing it in &frac12; and 1 ounce quantities.  In addition to purchasing and using marijuana,
Applicant also purchased and abused hashish and LSD in about 1979 and 1980.  He also abused
cocaine and heroin in about 1979 and 1980. </P>

<P>	When Applicant completed his SF 86 (Questionnaire for National Security Position) on June
10, 1996, as the initial step in applying for his security clearance, he certified that:</P>

<P>		My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true,
complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are
made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false
statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or
both.</P>

<P>under the bold-lettered caption:</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1"><CENTER>Certification That My Answers Are True</FONT></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>		</P>

<P>Applicant then answered "no" to the question 24a which asked:</P>

<P>		Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have
you illegally used any controlled substance for example, marijuana,
cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine,
heroin, etc.,) amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates methaqualone,
tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription
drugs?</P>

<P>	During his first interview with the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on September 19,
1996, Applicant did not mention his abuse of marijuana.  After this interview, he provided a detailed
account of his alcohol abuse history in an eight-page, signed sworn statement (see Gov Exh. 3).  This
eight page statement appears to include all of the significant information about his 20 years of
abusing  alcohol, but does not provide any information about his abuse of illegal drugs--primarily
marijuana.  Later when he was questioned about the "no" answer on the SF 86 during a second
interview with the DIS on April 9, 1997, Applicant explained that he had "skipped" over the question
quickly because he thought it pertained only to "hard drugs" (Gov. Exh. 2).<A HREF="97-0372.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  He further explained
that he had not mentioned his abuse of marijuana during the September 19 interview because he did
not think it was important.  He believed then--and still believes--that his principal addiction was
to alcohol (Gov. Exh. 2).  The Government did not proffer any evidence that Applicant was
specifically asked about his abuse of illegal drugs during the September 19 interview. </P>

<P>	When Applicant testified at his administrative hearing, he admitted that he had read and
understood question 24a when he completed the SF 86.  He had answered "no" because he did not
want to lose his job and because he did not consider "drugs as a major part of (his) history" (Tr. 27,
65).  He now acknowledges that he made a mistake in not answering the question truthfully (Tr. 68).</P>

<P>	Applicant has not used alcohol or marijuana since July 31, 1995.  He describes major
differences in the sobriety he has achieved during the past two years in contrast with the sobriety he
had achieved after earlier periods of treatment.  In previous attempts at sobriety, he made his own
rules and ignored "the real ones" (p. 6, Gov. Exh. 3, Tr. 54).  He was reluctant to accept established
rules or the suggestions of others on how to maintain sobriety.  Now, he is open to listening and
learning from the experiences of other recovering alcoholics.  He is not "doing things (his) way
anymore" (Tr. 56).  He has learned to involve other people in his life.  He is not just going to
meetings anymore.  He is now there to "work the program" (Tr. 56).  He attends at least six or seven
AA meetings each week (Tr. 48); he has a sponsor with whom he talks regularly; he reaches out to
other suffering alcoholics; he has a spiritual contact whom he chooses to call God; and he has
learned to accept life on life's terms realizing that it is sometimes unfair (p. 6, Gov. Exh. 3).  He
expressed joy in reconnecting with his family; seeing his "little sister" graduate from college, get
married, and have her first child (Tr. 55).</P>

<P>	Applicant has proffered petitions with dozens of signatures from co-workers and friends who
support his application for a security clearance (Applicant's Exh. B and C).  He has also submitted
a personal letter of reference from his landlord who describes Applicant as the "best tenant (she )
ever had" (Applicant Exhibit A). </P>

</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving
any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate that the facts proven have a
nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</P>

<P><CENTER></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion G)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>		(1) 	Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving
while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or
other criminal incidents related to alcohol use;</P>

<P>		(2)	Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reported for work or duty in an
intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job;</P>

<P>		(3)	Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of
alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</P>

<P>		(4)	Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>		(3)	Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;<STRONG><U></STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>		</STRONG></U>(4)	Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual
has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with
aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics
Anonymous or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of
at least 12 months, and received a favorable   prognosis by a credentialed
medical professional.<U><STRONG></STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>DRUG INVOLVEMENT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion H)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raised questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social
or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>  	Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>		(a)	drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>		(b)	inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P>	Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from
approved medical direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P> </P>

<P>		(1)	Any drug abuse </P>

<P>		(4)	Satisfactory completion of a drug treatment program prescribed by a
credentialed medical professional.</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>PERSONAL CONDUCT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion E)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness

classified information.</P>

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></P>

<P>		(2)	The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness...;</P>

<P>		(3)	Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant
and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personal
security or trustworthiness determination.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>			None Applicable</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion J)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>		(1)	Any criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>		(2)	The crime was an isolated incident.		<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria G, H, E, and J.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion G.  Applicant's testimony
at his administrative hearing--together with his prior admissions and the medical records from his
most recent inpatient treatment--have provided a detailed account of more than twenty years of
chronic alcohol abuse.  The severity of his problem is evident in his employment history prior to
August 1, 1995, and in the fact that he has sought treatment for alcohol abuse five different times. 
Abuse of alcohol had been a factor or the principal cause of his five arrests.  Earlier, abuse of alcohol
had caused him to be discharged from military service prior to the expiration of his term of service. 
From 1971 to August 1, 1995, alcohol was the dominant and the only consistent presence in
Applicant's life.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	In the past two years, Applicant has been diligent in his efforts to move beyond the
debilitating effects of alcohol dependence.  He completed an inpatient treatment program on August
28, 1995.  Since then, he has been attending six or seven AA meetings every week and has
developed a support network in addition to his sponsor with whom he speaks regularly.  He has
learned to reach out to other suffering alcoholics.  He has a job which he enjoys and a job at which
he has the full support of his co-workers.</P>

<P>	Applicant came across as someone who is finally facing the truth about his relationship with
alcohol.  He realizes the gravity of his past mistakes and is thankful every day for being given the
opportunity to live his life as a sober person.  Applicant's sincerity and his demonstrated efforts to
work the AA program during the past 24 months have persuaded this Administrative Judge that the
security concerns raised by his twenty years of alcohol abuse and dependence have been mitigated. 
Criterion G is concluded for Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion H.  Again, Applicant's
testimony together with prior admissions have provided a detailed account of more than twenty years
of regular marijuana abuse.  His regular use of marijuana had caused him to purchase the substance
in 1 and &frac12; ounce quantities on numerous occasions between 1970 and July 31, 1995.  In addition
to his recent regular marijuana abuse, Applicant had earlier used hashish, heroin, LSD and cocaine
in the 1979 to 1980 time frame.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Mitigation for Applicant's years of marijuana abuse is found in the efforts he has made to
deal honestly with his addiction problem in the past two years.  By his own account, he used
marijuana --in the time preceding July 31, 1995--primarily as an alternative to alcohol, and as a
means of curbing his craving for alcohol.  Applicant does not believe he was addicted to marijuana. 
And while there is evidence in his medical records to contradict that belief, the evidence of record
overwhelmingly supports his contention that his principal addiction was to alcohol.  Because
Applicant has succeeded in controlling his addiction to alcohol for the past 24 months, it is unlikely
that he will use marijuana in the future.  Criterion H is concluded for Applicant.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire..."  Facts are considered relevant and material when they are capable
of influencing a federal agency's decision, e.g., a decision to grant or deny a security clearance.  In
this instance, Applicant's regular abuse of marijuana prior to August 1, 1995 falls well within the
definition of materiality.  Because he believed that disclosing this information would jeopardize his
employment, he chose to withhold this information on the SF 86 which he completed on June 10,
1996.  Later when he was first interviewed by the DIS, he did not mention his years of marijuana
abuse.  He passed up an opportunity to make a good faith effort to "correct the falsification before
being confronted with the facts."  When he was asked about the "no" answer to question 24a on the
SF 86 during a second DIS interview, he provided an explanation that was not truthful; he stated that
he had "skipped" over the part of the question which asked about marijuana.  Not until the
administrative hearing did Applicant admit that he had consciously answered "no" to the question
because he was afraid of losing his job.</P>

<P>	Applicant is credited with subsequently providing honest and accurate information about his 
marijuana abuse.  However, it does not appear--from the record--that he made this disclosure
<STRONG>before</STRONG> he was "confronted with the facts."  Rather the evidence suggests that he admitted using
marijuana only after being confronted with information from his medical records.  And even when
confronted with the facts, he was not ready to admit that he had willfully provided inaccurate
information to the DoD by answering "no" to question 24a.  Instead of providing the real
reason--that he was afraid of losing his job--for not being truthful, he told the DIS that he had read
over the question too quickly to realize that it pertained to marijuana as well as to hard drugs. 
Subparagraph 3.a. of Criterion E is concluded against Applicant.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant's years of marijuana
abuse was clearly relevant and material to his security clearance eligibility.  His failure to disclose
this information to the DoD on the SF 86 which he completed on June 10, 1996 violated 18 U.S.C.
&sect;1001 and had the potential to influence the course of his background investigation in an area of
legitimate concern to the DoD.</P>

<P>	While Applicant has been involved in other incidents of criminal misconduct, all of his prior
misconduct was directly related to his abuse of alcohol.  The falsification of his SF 86 appears to
have been the result of an understandable--though misguided--concern with concealing a part of
his past that was embarrassing to him.  Because it was an isolated incident, it is found to be
mitigated.  Criterion J. is concluded for Applicant.</P>
