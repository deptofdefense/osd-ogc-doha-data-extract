<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 9 March 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-10390.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 15 April and 10 September 2004 and elected to 
have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 29 July 2004.  On 22 September 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 4 
October 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen.  He was a principal in a defense contractor, but because he lost his security clearance, he is now a junior 
vice-president.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Israel and immigrated to the U.S. with his family when he was 16 years old.  He became a U.S. citizen in 1971.  In 1974, he married a 
woman who was born in Germany.  She is also a dual national with Israel.  She became a U.S. citizen in 1980.  The couple has two adult children, both born in 
the U.S.  Applicant's parents are both deceased.  Applicant's father-in-law and brother-in-law are citizen residents of Israel.  He also has a few cousins who are 
citizen residents of Israel.  He contacts a few of these cousins a couple of times a year.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is an electrical engineer who has been employed by defense contractors for 30 years.  He received his first Department of Defense security clearance 
in 1973.  Applicant possesses a U.S. passport issued on 13 September 1995 that expires on 12 September 2005.  He also has an Israeli passport that was issued 
on 10 July 1996.  He used it on his most recent trip to Israel which was also in 1996.  The passport expired in 1998, but in 1999 was extended until 14 
September 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant executed his security clearance application (SCA) on 7 February 2003.  Question 15 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had an active 
passport that was issued by a foreign government.  Applicant answered "no."</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent on 25 March 2003.  In arranging the interview, the DSS agent asked Applicant to bring 
his passports to the interview.  Applicant admitted being a dual national and possessing both a U.S. and Israeli passport.  He expressed a willingness to 
renounce his Israeli citizenship and relinquish his Israeli passport by the end of April 2003.  Applicant still possessed the Israeli passport at the time of the 
hearing.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C--Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Israel (&para; 1.a), possessed an Israeli passport (&para; 1.b), and applied for an Israeli passport after 
being issued a U.S. passport (&para; 1.c).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be prone 
to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Although contained in three distinct 
subparagraphs of SOR &para; 1, the disqualifying conduct amounts to only one allegation: Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Israel by obtaining and 
possessing an Israeli passport after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  It may be disqualifying for an Applicant to exercise dual citizenship.  DC E2.A3.1.2.1.  
In this case, Applicant exercised that dual citizenship by obtaining and possessing an Israeli passport after he became a U.S. citizen.  DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  An 
applicant may mitigate the disqualifying conditions by demonstrating that his dual citizenship is based solely on his birth in the foreign country (MC 
E2.A3.1.3.1) and expressing a willingness to renounce his citizenship in the foreign country (MC E2.A3.1.3.4).  Although Applicant's dual citizenship is based 
solely on his birth in Israel, by obtaining and using an Israeli passport after he became a U.S. citizen and possessed a U.S. passport, he demonstrated a foreign 
preference for Israel.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce his Israeli citizenship and relinquish his Israeli passport.  Applicant claims he has been unable to do so 
because the Israeli government is "clarifying his Israeli citizenship."  Exs. C, D, E.  Nevertheless, a clearance must "be denied or revoked unless the applicant 
surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."  Memo. from Arthur L. 
oney, Asst Sec. Def. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication 
Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline</EM> (Aug. 16, 2000).</SPAN>  Applicant has done neither.  Under the 
circumstances, I am required to find against Applicant on &para; 1.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father-in-law, brother-in-law, and cousins are citizen residents of Israel (&para; 2.a); Applicant maintains quarterly contact 
with his relatives in Israel (&para; 2.b),; and he traveled to Israel in 1996 to visit relatives (&para; 2.c).  A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A security concern exists if an applicant has immediate family members, or other persons to whom he is bound by affection or obligation, who are citizens, 
residents, or present in a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, 
members of his wife's immediate family.  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant failed to rebut the 
presumption with regard to his father-in-law and his brother-in-law.  Evidence Applicant stays in touch with other relatives in Israel establishes that he is bound 
by affection or obligation to them.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns by showing his foreign associates are not agents of a foreign government and are not in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and loyalty to the associate.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  
After reviewing all of the evidence, I am convinced Applicant's foreign associates are not agents of a foreign government.  But they are in a position where they 
could be exploited.  Applicant could also mitigate this security concern by showing his contact and correspondence with the foreign associates is "casual and 
infrequent."  MC E2.A2.1.3.3.  While his contacts are infrequent, they do not appear casual, at least with his father-in-law.  Under all the circumstances, I find 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to note he possessed an Israeli passport (&para; 3.a).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may 
not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from an SCA raises a security concern regarding an applicant's 
trustworthiness, reliability, and candor.  DC E2.A5.1.2.1.  The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA that, 
within the previous seven years, he possessed an Israeli passport.  The possession of a foreign passport is relevant and material to a determination of an 
applicant's security worthiness.  Proof Applicant omitted this information from his SCA shifted the burden to Applicant to explain the omissions sufficiently to 
negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant never provided convincing evidence as to why he did not list his possession of the Israeli passport on his 
SCA.  He asserts he thought his passport had expired and he made prompt good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  
C E2.A5.1.3.3.  But he obviously knew he was going to be questioned about his passports--the DSS agent instructed him to bring them to the interview.  
Applicant was just not credible.  I find against him on &para; 3.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
