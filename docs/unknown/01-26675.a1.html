<P>Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a decision, dated March 17, 2003, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: 1. Whether the Administrative Judge erred in finding that Applicant had a history of failing to satisfy his 
financial obligations; and 2. Whether the Administrative Judge's factual finding that Applicant took a "pleasure trip" in 1997 is supported by substantial 
evidence.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 7, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR   A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared, and a copy was provided to Applicant.  A response to the FORM was 
received from Applicant, and the case was assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination.  The Judge issued a written decision, dated March 17, 2003, 
in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-26675.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.<A HREF="01-26675.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive,  Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in finding that Applicant has a history of failing to satisfy his financial obligations</SPAN>.  Applicant argues that the 
Judge's finding that Applicant had a history of failing to satisfy his financial obligations is "not entirely accurate."  Applicant contends that his credit rating 
before 1997 was excellent.  Applicant argues that if he had a "history" of not </P> 
 
<P>paying his bills, he would not have been able to become indebted to such an extent that more than $123,000 was discharged in bankruptcy.  Applicant's 
response to the SOR indicates that the debts in issue were all incurred between 1995 and 1997, and this was the only time in his life that he was unable to meet 
his financial obligations.</P> 
 
<P>Here, the Administrative Judge noted the policy in the Financial Considerations guideline that security concerns may be raised when an applicant has a history 
of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying Condition 1) or is unable or unwilling to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 3).  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Enclosure 
2, Items E2.A6.1.2.1 and E2.A6.1.2.3.  Consistent with Applicant's own admission, the Judge found that Applicant lived off credit cards from approximately 
1995 to 1998.  Other evidence of record establishes that these debts were unsatisfied and were not addressed until Applicant's discharge in bankruptcy in 
October 2001.  Given these facts, there is reasonable support for the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant had a "history" of failing to satisfy his 
financial obligations.  Applicant's filing for bankruptcy in 2001 did not preclude the Judge from considering the security significance of the actions that lead to 
the delinquent debts and Applicant's longstanding failure to address these debts once incurred.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's factual finding that Applicant took a "pleasure trip" in 1997 is supported by substantial evidence</SPAN>.  Applicant contends 
that the Administrative Judge erred in finding that unanswered questions remain in how Applicant financed a one-month "pleasure" trip overseas in 1997, in a 
period when, admittedly, he was living off of credit cards.  On appeal, Applicant proffers that he had to categorize the trip as "pleasure" because it was for 
personal purposes and in this case there was a family emergency with most of the expenses handled by relatives.  We interpret Applicant's appeal as raising the 
issue of whether the Judge substituted speculation for reasonable inference.  In effect, Applicant contends that it was unreasonable for the Judge to conclude 
that such a trip was financially irresponsible just because Applicant was on a month-long personal trip during a period of financial difficulty.</P> 
 
<P>In presenting this issue on appeal, Applicant makes assertions about his trip overseas in 1997 that go beyond record evidence.  As noted earlier in this decision, 
the Appeal Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Consequently, in evaluating the Administrative Judge's conclusions on this point, the Board will 
confine its consideration to the record.  The record evidence contains the following: (1) a description on a security clearance questionnaire of a month long 
overseas trip in 1997 that is characterized as "pleasure," and (2) a brief description of the same trip in a written statement to an investigating agent, where 
Applicant indicated that he and his wife traveled overseas to visit her 90-year-old grandfather, without elaboration.  Given this evidence, the Board need not 
agree with the Judge to conclude that the Judge could infer that Applicant had taken a "pleasure" trip in the midst of his financial difficulties.  Applicant has 
failed to demonstrate error on the part of the Administrative Judge. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below.  The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance 
decision for the reasons stated herein.</P>
