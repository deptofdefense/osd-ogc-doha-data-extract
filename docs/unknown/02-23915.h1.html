<P>	Applicant was convicted on three occasions between 1997 and 1999 of either not having a 
valid driver's license or driving while his license was suspended. Each of those offenses arose from 
an unpaid traffic fine that was levied in the state where Applicant previously resided. He was also 
charged with misdemeanor assault in 1996. That charge was dismissed after he paid a fine and 
attended an anger management course. Applicant credibly explained why he did not disclose these 
occurrences in the security clearance application he signed in December 1999. Applicant has 
mitigated all security clearance concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>	On July 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-23915.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in 
essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct) 
and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received 
by DOHA on September 15, 2003. He admitted one SOR allegation, denied three others, and did not 
address a fifth allegation. Applicant requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The case was assigned to another administrative judge on November 6, 2003, and reassigned 
to me on November 21, 2003, due to caseload considerations. A notice of hearing was issued on 
December 2, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2003. I vacated that hearing date based 
on personal reasons. A new notice of hearing was issued on January 12, 2004, rescheduling the 
hearing for February 3, 2004. The hearing was conducted as rescheduled.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The government submitted seven documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7 and admitted into the record without an objection. The Applicant 
testified at the hearing, called one character witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted twenty-seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-27 and admitted into the 
record without an objection. The transcript was received on February 12, 2004.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's admission to the one SOR allegation is incorporated herein.  In addition, after 
a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is 38 years old and has been employed as a laborer by a government contractor 
since February 1996, first as a temporary and later as a permanent employee. He was laid-off from 
November 1997 to June 1998, while still employed as a temporary. He has been married since 
February 1986. He and his wife have two children, ages twenty and fourteen, who are both students. 
Applicant graduated from high school in 1984, and has completed some further studies at community 
colleges. The character witness, numerous letters of recommendation, and employment certificates  
submitted by Applicant attest to his reputation for being honest, trustworthy, dependable, and well-liked, both as an individual and as an employee. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was raised and lived in a different state from his present state of residence until 
1996. He decided to relocate to the area in which he presently resides because of the prevalence of 
crime in the area where he formerly resided and out of concern for the well-being of his children. 
Applicant preceded his family and shared a residence with two other persons, one male and one 
female, when he first relocated to his present state of residence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	On September 9, 1996, Applicant got into an argument with his female roommate that 
became physical when she attempted to scratch and kick him. She contacted the police and Applicant 
was charged with Domestic Violence Assault 4</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP>. A court summons was sent to Applicant on 
December 5, 1996, and returned as undelivered on December 13, 1996, because he had moved. A 
warrant for his arrest was issued on December 24, 1996, and was served upon him on January 11, 
1997. Applicant agreed to a deferred prosecution on March 27, 1997, and was ordered to pay a fine 
in the amount of $150.00 and to attend an anger management class. He paid the fine and completed 
the class, and the charge was dismissed on March 28, 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant apparently had an unpaid traffic ticket when he moved in 1996 that resulted in the 
suspension of his driver's license. As a result, he was charged with driving without a valid driver's 
license on April 18, 1997, and driving while license suspended (DWLS) on March 20, 1998 and 
April 15, 1999.<A HREF="02-23915.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He was found guilty on each occasion and ordered to pay fines of $457.00 ($362.00 
suspended) for the no valid driver's license offense, $250.00 for the 1998 DWLS offense, and 
$1,000.00 ($700.00 suspended) for the 1999 DWLS offense. Additionally, he was sentenced to serve 
90 days in jail for the 1999 DWLS offense (90 days suspended). Applicant paid each fine and the 
cases were closed. He also paid the outstanding fine of $172.00 on the ticket from his former state 
of residence on August 23, 2002, resulting in the clearance of the warrant from that state and 
reinstatement of his driving privilege.          	</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant signed a security clearance application (SF 86) on December 17, 1999, in which 
he answered "No" to question 26: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or 
convicted of any offense(s) not listed is modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less 
than $150.00 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) . . . .</EM> Based on the arrests and traffic 
offenses described above, that answer was false. Applicant actually prepared a handwritten SF 86, 
submitted that form at his workplace, and someone there typed the document that was admitted as 
GE 1, and presented it to Applicant to sign. Applicant requested to see the handwritten form he 
prepared when he was informed of the incorrect answer provided to question 26 to verify that he had 
not listed the arrests, but the handwritten form apparently was not retained. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Unable to verify he gave a wrong answer in the handwritten form, Applicant has acquiesced 
to the government's assertion that he answered question 26 incorrectly, and acknowledged that he 
signed the typewritten form. Applicant explains the incorrect answer as resulting from either his 
misunderstanding question 26 or thinking he was not required to lists the arrests because of his 
understanding that the charges would not be on his record because of the type of disposition entered.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's 
eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and 
itigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision 
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and 
circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against 
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever 
a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline 
J, pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their 
respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-23915.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden 
shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the 
case against him.<A HREF="02-23915.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-23915.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of 
criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's 
secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or 
fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. He was charged 
with assault and three relatively serious traffic offenses between September 1996 and April 1999. 
Additionally, a warrant was issued for his arrest sometime earlier based upon his failure to pay a 
traffic fine in his former state of residence. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime 
or multiple lesser offenses </EM>applies in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The last traffic offense Applicant committed occurred in December 1998. The only non-traffic offense he was charged with occurred in September 1996, and that charge was ultimately 
dismissed. Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent </EM>applies. Further, 
having considered Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying at the hearing, along 
with the reputation evidence he submitted and the whole-person factors in evidence, I find MC 6: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>also applies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	 </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	After considering the evidence of record in this case, and weighing the disqualifying 
condition against the mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security concern 
caused by his criminal conduct.  Guideline J is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Under Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central 
question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified information. Once again, I have considered Applicant's appearance, demeanor, 
and manner of testifying at the hearing, along with the reputation evidence he submitted and the 
whole-person factors in evidence in determining whether there was a deliberate omission on his part 
in the SF 86 he signed. It is clear from the evidence that Applicant lacks experience in preparing 
forms such as the SF 86. Further, he is obviously a relatively unsophisticated individual who 
convincingly testified: "I think now looking at it - - when I thought I understood what I was doin', 
I didn't understand it. It was like I didn't have a clue." (Tr. pg. 70) I find Applicant did not 
deliberately falsify the SF 86 he submitted and no disqualifying condition applies under Guideline 
E. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.    </SPAN></P>
