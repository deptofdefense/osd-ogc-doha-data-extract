<P>In the fall of 1998, Applicant, a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor, by rude behavior and failure to communicate and cooperate with his superiors, 
demonstrated his unreliability, poor judgment, and lack of trustworthiness.  However, this personal conduct has been mitigated because it was an isolated period 
of time, was not recent, and his subsequent conduct is in compliance with DoD guidelines.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline E (personal conduct), detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</P> 
<P>In a written statement, dated December 10, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR,  and requested a hearing.  The case was previously 
assigned to another administrative judge on July 29, 2004, but was reassigned to me on February 1, 2005, due to caseload considerations. Notice of the hearing 
was issued April 1, 2005, scheduling the hearing for May 18, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  The transcript was received June 1, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a divorced, 38-year-old owner-employee of a federal contractor.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He is a native of Vietnam, came to the U. S. in 1975, and became a naturalized 
citizen in 1987.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In 1997 and 1998, he was employed by a federal contractor as a junior network administrator.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He was assigned to work with the person 
hiring him to observe and learn what his supervisor was doing.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After four months they went on a trip and his supervisor died unexpectedly.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Appellant 
replaced his supervisor in a job that required maintaining a software system for a federal agency.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Appellant was at a disadvantage because his supervisor's 
knowledge of the system died with the supervisor, and there was a backlog of work that needed to be done.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </P> 
<P>In June 1998, Appellant received a disciplinary reprimand for making a personnel action without the approval of the company's human resources department.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  
In September 1998, Appellant was assigned to a contract in a western state.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  One of the agency's employees who worked with Applicant testified that 
Applicant at first was a "go-getter," that he seemed to be ambitious, and that he had been recognized by the agency for his excellent work.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He further testified 
that about the last four to six months that Applicant worked for the contractor, he received a "tremendous amount" of complaints about Applicant.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He stated 
that these complaints talked about Applicant's failure to cooperate, rude behavior, ignoring requests for documentation, failure to communicate with agency 
worksite network administrators, demands for system changes in contravention of his duties, being argumentative, and missing deadlines.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> His opinion was 
that Applicant was unreliable, untrustworthy, had poor judgement, and that he would not hire him.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Another of the contractor's employees made a site visit to observe Applicant's behavior.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  His opinions of Applicant were the same and he felt Applicant 
should not have a security clearance.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  </P> 
<P>Upon recommendation of the government agency to the contractor, Applicant was terminated from the agency's contract and he submitted his resignation.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant testified that he was not uncooperative, that he did not ignore requests for documentation, that he was not rude, that he did not miss deadlines, that he 
was not argumentative, and that he did in fact communicate with staff.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Three witnesses who have worked with him on projects over the past several years testified that Applicant is trustworthy, reliable, and that he should be given a 
clearance.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  The 
President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates 
loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting 
allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information."<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
<P>  
Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-22196.ind.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: Guideline E 
(personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant denied the allegations enumerated in the SOR.  However, two witnesses for the government, both supervisors of Applicant, confirmed that he 
demonstrated rude behavior, that he failed to cooperate and fully follow orders, that he failed to communicate with his supervisors, and for a four to six month 
period in the summer and fall of 1998, conducted himself in such a manner that he lost the confidence, trust, and reliance of those supervisors.  Applicant's 
three witnesses had no knowledge of the events listed in the SOR as their interactions with Applicant occurred in the time frame after 2000. Applicant's 
witnesses testified to his good character, trustworthiness, reliability, and that he should be given a clearance.  I conclude that the government established 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1. <EM>(Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, 
coworkers, neighbors and other acquaintances)</EM>.   I believe the testimony of the government witnesses was the more credible and thus the government 
established its case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, I also find that Applicant has mitigated the allegations pursuant to PC MC E2.A5.1.3.1. (<EM>The information was not pertinent to a determination of 
judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability) </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2. (<EM>the conduct was an isolated incident and was not recent</EM>).  This is what has transpired in 
this case.  Applicant's problems of personal conduct are limited to a four to six month time frame in the fall of 1998.  It has been seven years since this series of 
incidents.  Applicant's witnesses testified that they  have worked with him over the past several years and their testimony is that Applicant has displayed 
conduct that is reliable, trustworthy, that he is a person of good character, and should be granted a security clearance.  I conclude that Applicant has matured and 
has shown that he can better conduct himself in working with fellow employees.  Therefore,  I conclude he successfully mitigated the disqualifying condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not engaged in any misconduct during the past seven years such as to render him an inappropriate candidate for a security clearance.   I conclude 
Guideline E for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
