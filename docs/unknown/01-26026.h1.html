<P>Applicant's conviction for malicious destruction and sentence to two years imprisonment required denial of his clearance under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986, notwithstanding that Applicant actually only served 60 days, with credit for time served before trial. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 3 July 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-26026.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 24 July 
2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 13 August 2002. I set the case on 23 August 2002, and issued a 
Notice of Hearing on 29 August 2002, for a hearing on 23 September 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented four exhibits--three admitted without objection, one excluded by me despite there being no objection--and no 
witnesses;  Applicant presented three exhibits and the testimony of two witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 1 October 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 45-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. Applicant retired from the Army as a Staff Sergeant (E-6) 
communications NCO in 1994. In his time in the Army, he was awarded the Good Conduct Medal (6 awards), Overseas Service Ribbon (3 awards), 
Professional Development Ribbon (3 awards), National Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Army Achievement Medal (2 awards), and the 
Army Commendation Medal (A.E. A). He also held a security clearance during most of his time in the Army (G.E. 1, Tr. 23-24). He qualified as an expert 
marksman with the M-16 (A.E. A, Tr. 38).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 30 October 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, reckless endangerment, and malicious destruction of 
property over $300.00 value--a misdemeanor under his state's criminal code. He later pleaded guilty to the malicious destruction charge, and was sentenced to 
two years imprisonment, all but 60 days suspended. He served the 60 days through home detention, received credit for 35 days pre-trial restraint, and was 
placed on work-release. Applicant was also given 18 months supervised probation. The remaining counts were <EM>nolle prosequi</EM> (G.E. 3, 4). Applicant completed 
his probation without incident (A.E.  B, Tr. 32).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 4 April 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86)(G.E. 1) on which he answered "yes" to the question designed to elicit his 
misdemeanor arrest record, and disclosed the above arrest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant acknowledged his responsibility for the incident. He described being awakened very early the morning of 
the incident by headlights coming in through his bedroom. Because of a recent spate of unsolved burglaries in the area, Applicant's observation of a suspicious-looking vehicle in the neighborhood in recent weeks, and the fact that his parents (who lived next door) had been burglarized twice in the past, Applicant got 
his shotgun and went into the yard and fired a shot at the rear bumper of the departing vehicle. Applicant had the wrong car; it was not the vehicle Applicant 
had seen in the neighborhood in recent weeks, but a similar-looking vehicle belonging to the parents' newspaper deliverer. After firing the shotgun, Applicant 
put the shotgun in his trailer and attempted to follow the car, but was unsuccessful. By the time he returned home, police had identified Applicant as the 
shooter, and he was arrested and charged as above shortly after arriving back at his trailer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged that he did not attempt to contact local police any of the times he observed the suspicious-looking vehicle in the area, or on the night 
of the incident. He agrees he used poor judgment in shooting at the vehicle, even if it was just to frighten the occupants (Tr. 36, 50). Applicant completed 
technical training to move into the computer field in Month 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's corporate supervisor (Applicant has an on-site supervisor who is an employee  of the client) considers Applicant to be trustworthy and extremely 
reliable (Tr. 55). Applicant has been retained and promoted in the company when others have been laid off in a recent series of staff reductions. This supervisor 
has no social contact with Applicant and is not aware of the allegations of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc.,</EM> under an assessment of the whole person.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CRIMINAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE J)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 amended Title 10 U.S. Code to add a new section, &sect;986, 
precluding the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DoD) under four specific circumstances. On 7 June 2001, the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing regulations under DoD 5200.2-R; the Director, DOHA issued Operating Instruction 64 (O.I. 64) on 10 July 
2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's criminal conduct in October 1996 was serious, a conclusion confirmed by the fact that 
Applicant was sentenced to two years in prison for a misdemeanor offense. Nevertheless, I conclude that the criminal conduct is otherwise mitigated, but for the 
application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to this case. First, the resolution of Applicant's criminal case tends to corroborate his explanations of his conduct. Without 
condoning Applicant's conduct in shooting at a retreating vehicle, the circumstances of his conduct are less serious than appear at first blush. All but 60 days of 
Applicant's sentence was suspended; Applicant was permitted to serve the remainder on house detention, with credit for the 35 days pre-trial restraint served. 
Although Applicant was forty at the time of this offense, and thus cannot be said to have acted out of youthful immaturity, there has been no repeat of the 
misconduct. Furthermore, the criminal conduct was not recent, having occurred nearly 6 years ago, and was isolated--there being no apparent criminal conduct 
either before or after the October 1996 incident.  Finally, there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, documented both by Applicant's satisfactory 
completion of his probation and attainment of new educational qualifications since the incident,  and by his character reference which, while not indicating any 
knowledge of Applicant's criminal past, nevertheless attest to his work performance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Were this the end of the analysis under Guideline J., I would conclude Applicant's criminal conduct in 1996 mitigated. However, as alleged in subparagraph b. 
of the SOR, Applicant's case falls within the purview of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986. Under the new regulations issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, because 
Applicant was convicted in state court and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year, I may not mitigate his criminal conduct. Accordingly, I find 
Guideline J. against Applicant. However, because I do so solely because of the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to this case, I make the following statement as 
required by O.I. 64 in such a case: I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 .</SPAN></P>
