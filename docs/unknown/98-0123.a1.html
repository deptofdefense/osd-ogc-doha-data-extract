<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Fulton S. Hamilton, Esq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Kathryn M. Braeman issued a decision, dated June 8, 1998, in which she concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's factual findings are not supported
by the record evidence; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 9, 1998 to Applicant. 
The SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on April 9, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which she
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The
case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's factual findings are not supported by the record evidence</U>.  The Administrative
Judge found that Applicant was responsible for most of the debts alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="98-0123.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Applicant contends the Judge
erred in making those findings because: (a) the Judge improperly relied on four credit reports (Government Exhibits 3, 4,
5 and 6) that lacked a proper foundation; (b) the absence of objection by Applicant to the admissibility of those credit
reports did not justify the Judge in assuming the information contained in those reports was reliable or accurate; (c) even
if the Judge did not err in admitting the credit reports, the Judge should have given them little weight because they were
prepared for purposes of litigation; and (d) the Judge ignored unrebutted evidence that Applicant was personally
responsible for incurring only a small percentage of the outstanding debts.  For the reasons that follow, the Board
concludes Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge erred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(a) At the hearing, Applicant did not object to the admissibility of Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6.  By doing so,
Applicant waived any objection to their admissibility and relieved Department Counsel of any obligation to present
evidence to establish any foundation for those four exhibits.  It is too late for Applicant to raise foundation objections to
those four exhibits on appeal.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0817 (February 21, 1997) at p. 6 n.6; ISCR Case No. 96-0299
(December 31, 1996) at p. 2.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(b) The admission of Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6 without objection from Applicant did not relieve the
Administrative Judge from the obligation to evaluate those documents and consider what weight, if any, they reasonably
could be given in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0676 (September 29, 1998) at p. 4. 
At the hearing, Applicant had the opportunity to present evidence about his financial situation, including the opportunity
to present any evidence showing that the credit reports were not reliable or accurate.  To the extent that Applicant did not
present evidence to challenge the accuracy or reliability of the credit reports, the Judge did not act in an arbitrary or
capricious manner or contrary to law by considering those reports in making her findings about Applicant's financial
history.  Furthermore, a review of the record shows that the Judge's findings about Applicant's financial history are
supported by Applicant's admissions to the SOR and  evidence in addition to Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6, including
Applicant's hearing testimony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c) The Administrative Judge has discretion to weigh the evidence.  The Board will not disturb a Judge's weighing of the
evidence unless there is a showing the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 97-0676 (September 29, 1998) at pp. 3-4.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes
Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge erred in her weighing of the four credit reports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(d) There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considers all the evidence, unless the Judge expressly
states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0783 (August 7, 1998) at p. 4.  Furthermore, a Judge is not required to give
full weight to evidence merely because it is unrebutted.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DISCR Case No. 90-2069 (March 25, 1992) at p. 10. 
While the Judge could not simply ignore Applicant's testimony, she was not required, as a matter of law, to accept it
uncritically or view it in isolation from the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant presented evidence to show that many
of the debts were not personally incurred by him.  However, it is irrelevant that Applicant did not personally incur those
debts if the record evidence shows that he is legally responsible for them.  A review of the record shows that the Judge
had a rational basis for finding Applicant is legally responsible for the debts that he did not personally incur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(2) <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>.  Applicant makes
several arguments to support his contention that the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law: (a) the Judge relied on Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations while ignoring Applicant's evidence
in explanation and mitigation of his debts; (b) the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the favorable testimony of
Applicant's witness; (c) the Judge gave undue weight to the four credit reports (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6); (d)
the Judge failed to take into account pertinent mitigating factors; (e) other Judges have made favorable decisions in
Criterion F cases involving financial situations worse than Applicant's; (e) the Judge's decision does not reflect a
reasonable application of pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines; (f) the Judge's decision does not reflect a  fair and impartial,
commonsense decision as required by Section F.3.; and (g) the Judge's adverse decision is not supported by the weight of
the record evidence.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge's
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As discussed earlier, there is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence. 
That presumption is not rebutted merely because the Judge weighed the evidence differently than Applicant would have
liked.  Even when an applicant presents favorable evidence, the Judge has to decide whether the favorable evidence
outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0191 (April 28, 1998) at pp. 4-5.  None of
Applicant's arguments persuades the Board that the Judge's weighing of the evidence was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.  The Judge's findings reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant's ability to
argue for an alternate interpretation of the evidence, standing alone, does not demonstrate the Judge's findings are
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0625 (August 17, 1998) at p. 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section F.3.  <EM>See
also</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0066 (August 28, 1998) at p. 2.  In this case, the Judge cited pertinent provisions of the Financial
Considerations Adjudicative Guidelines (Decision at p. 5), explained why she gave reduced weight to Financial
Considerations Mitigating Guideline 3, and gave reasons for why she did not apply Financial Considerations Mitigating
Guidelines 4 and 6 (Decision at p. 6).  The Board does not have to agree with the Judge's analysis under the Adjudicative
Guidelines to conclude it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's reliance on decisions by other Administrative Judges in other Criterion F cases is misplaced.  Just as a trial
judge is not bound to follow decisions made by other trial judges, the Judge in this case is not bound to follow decisions
made by her colleagues in other cases.  Furthermore, decisions made by Judges of the Hearing Office are not binding on
the Board.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0191 (April 28, 1998) at p. 2 n.1.  Accordingly, the Board need not discuss or
distinguish decisions by Judges made in other Criterion F cases to decide whether the Judge's decision in this case is
sustainable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, the Administrative Judge's decision falls within the bounds of her discretion under Section F.3.  The Judge
discussed both the favorable and unfavorable evidence.  The Judge took into account the evidence that Applicant did not
personally incur most of the debts alleged in the SOR, as well as the evidence that Applicant was legally responsible for
those debts.  The Judge also considered Applicant's efforts at addressing the debts once he returned from duty overseas
and explained why she concluded, on balance, that those efforts were not sufficient to overcome the negative implications
of Applicant's financial situation.  And, as discussed earlier, the Judge applied pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative
Guidelines.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes the Judge complied with the requirements of Section
F.3.</FONT></P>
