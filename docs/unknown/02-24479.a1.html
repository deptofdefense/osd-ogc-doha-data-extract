  Absent a showing that Department Counsel's conduct resulted in a denial of due process or unduly affected the substance of an Administrative Judge's decision in some way, the Board need not address Applicant's complaints about Department Counsel's conduct.  Applicant waived any objection to the  three-hour delay before his case was heard by the Judge.  Given the record evidence in this case, it was reasonable for the Judge to find that Applicant's military  character references were not aware of his financial problems.  Government officials and employees were not obligated to give Applicant legal advice or  guidance, or tell him how to best prepare for his hearing.  Applicant was on notice of his obligation to prepare for the hearing and to present evidence on his  behalf.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr. issued a decision dated March 3, 2003 in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether he was denied a fair and impartial hearing; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in finding 
that Applicant's military character references were unaware of his financial problems; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance 
decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant dated October 8, 2002.  The SOR was based on 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant requested a hearing which was held on February 7, 2003.  The Administrative Judge issued a decision dated 
arch 3, 2003 in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant 
appealed.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-24479.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied a fair and impartial hearing</SPAN>.  Applicant alleges the following regarding the conduct of his hearing: (a) the hearing started three 
hours later than scheduled and this had the effect of requiring him to wait in a hallway that was uncomfortably cold, allowed his anxiety and apprehension to 
grow, affected his preparedness and personal resolve, and significantly detracted from his ability to state and support his case; (b) he was rushed through the 
hearing; and (c) the court reporter appeared to "doze off" on at least two occasions during the hearing.  Applicant's appeal arguments fail to establish that he 
was denied due process.</P> 
 
<P>Prior to the presentation of evidence at the hearing, the Administrative Judge specifically asked Applicant if he had any procedural problems he wished to make 
the Judge aware of.  In making this inquiry the Judge specifically referenced the three-hour delay in the start of the hearing.  At that time Applicant answered in 
the negative and only made brief mention of a perceived problem in attempting to submit documents prior to the hearing.<A HREF="02-24479.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Having voiced no concerns at the 
hearing about the delay and any effects that delay may have had upon his ability to present his case, Applicant has waived his right to pursue the issue on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Similarly, Applicant raised no concerns at the time of the hearing based on any perception that he was "being rushed" or based on any inattentiveness on the 
part of the court reporter.  These issues were therefore waived as well.  Moreover, DOHA hearings are afforded a presumption of administrative regularity.  
After a review of the hearing transcript and the evidence presented, the Board is satisfied that Applicant was afforded an adequate opportunity to present his 
case and that the hearing transcript was accurate.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative erred in finding that Applicant's military character references were unaware of his financial problems</SPAN>.  In his decision, the 
Administrative Judge states that Applicant's military character references "specifically express no concerns over granting Applicant's clearance, although none 
appear to be aware of his financial problems."  Applicant asserts on appeal that two of his military references were aware of his debt problems.  He argues that 
the two military members in question were notary publics who notarized documents that contained detailed information about his finances.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the record evidence shows that the two military members in question were officers who each notarized a document for Applicant.  One notarized 
Applicant's answer to the Statement of Reasons.  The other notarized Applicant's response to a request for interrogatories submitted by DOHA.  The two 
officers later provided letters of support to Applicant which he submitted as evidence on his behalf.  Neither of the two letters make any reference to 
Applicant's financial problems.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument on appeal fails to demonstrate error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  The answer to the Statement of Reasons that was notarized 
by one officer makes general references to Applicant's financial problems but contains no specifics as to the number of debts, their delinquent or non-delinquent status or the amount of money involved.  The responses to the request for interrogatories consist of a notarized letter from Applicant that again 
makes only general references to financial problems and his efforts to resolve them.  The response included 20 attachments that did provide some detail about 
Applicant's overdue accounts but there is no indication that the officer who notarized the letter saw or was aware of the contents of the attachments.  Even 
though the two officers notarized the documents, their duties as notaries extended to having Applicant swear or attest to the truthfulness of the documents.  In 
so doing, the officers would not necessarily become aware of the details of the contents of the documents and there is no evidence in this case that they actually 
were aware. Since their character letters do not mention Applicant's financial difficulties, the Judge's finding that they were not familiar with Applicant's plight 
was a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law</SPAN>.  On appeal Appellant asserts the following: 
(a) he wants to pay down his debts but will not use up his savings for debt reduction until he is given the opportunity for future employment; (b) he has taken 
steps to be in a better position to pay his debts by no longer using credit cards, driving older vehicles and moving to a lower rent area; (c) the Administrative 
Judge used inflammatory and unprofessional language in his decision; and (d) the Government "failed" him by not responding to his various pre-hearing 
inquiries regarding how he could best mitigate his case.  The Board construes these various assertions as a claim that the Judge's decision is arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Regarding assertions a and b, Applicant makes no specific allegation of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  By merely discussing various factors that 
he feels mitigate his case, he is simply restating arguments on appeal that he made below.  His ability to argue for an interpretation of the record evidence that 
differs from the interpretation of the Administrative Judge does not establish that the Judge rendered a decision that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant objects to the Administrative Judge using the following language in his decision: "While Applicant appears to have stopped digging himself into a 
financial hole, he has not started to pull himself out of it. . . ."  Applicant states that he considers the Judge's language to be inflammatory and unprofessional.  
While the language is pointed, Applicant fails to specifically identify how the language he complains of constitutes error.  Decisions of Administrative Judges 
are not measured against a standard of perfection.  Absent a showing of factual or legal error that prejudices a party, the Board need not concern itself with the 
particular language used by Administrative Judges in their decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant states that, prior to the hearing, he made many attempts to contact the Defense Security Service (DSS) and DOHA seeking advice on how to "make 
my situation better."  He complains that the government did not respond, and did not offer any legal advice or legal counsel for his defense.  He states he was 
seeking guidance on how to best mitigate his case and states that if someone had explained to him that he had to show a continuous pattern of paying his debts, 
his situation would now be different.</P> 
 
<P>It would be inappropriate for the government, as a party in these proceedings, to offer advice or provide guidance to Applicant as to how to conduct his daily 
affairs so as to put his case in the most favorable light.  Additionally, the government is not required to provide legal counsel for Applicant to represent him in 
these proceedings.  Moreover, the Board has no jurisdiction over actions of the DSS and, unless its actions directly impact upon Applicant's ability to prepare 
his case or otherwise result in a denial of due process, the Board lacks jurisdiction over DOHA's pre-hearing interactions with Applicant.  The Directive, a copy 
of which was provided to Applicant, placed him on notice that he was responsible for preparing for the hearing and presenting evidence on his behalf.  <EM>See</EM> 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Applicant's obligation to prepare for the hearing and present his case also was communicated to him 
in the prehearing guidance sent to him by the Hearing Office.  Applicant's arguments concerning the government's failure to provide him with advice do not 
establish error.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Part of Applicant's appeal brief (Paragraphs 2 and 3) alleges error on the part of Department Counsel as opposed to the Judge.  Another part of the brief 
alleges a lack of preparation on the part of Department Counsel during the hearing.  Absent a showing that Department Counsel's conduct resulted in a denial of 
due process or unduly affected the substance of the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision in some way, the Board need not address these assertions 
of error.  Applicant has failed to establish how these alleged errors by Department Counsel prejudiced him in any meaningful way.
