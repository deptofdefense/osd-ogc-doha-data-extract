<P>Applicant emigrated from Iran to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2003.  Nevertheless, he retains his Iranian passport.  His wife and parents are 
permanent U.S. residents, but Iranian citizens.  Applicant's in-laws are citizen residents of Iran.  Applicant's parents, wife, and children are currently in Iran.  
Applicant failed to mitigate the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns.  Eligibility for an ADP II/III position is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to find Applicant eligible to occupy an information systems position designated ADP II/III to 
support a contract with the Department of Defense.<A HREF="03-11339.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On 16 December 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-11339.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR 
in writing on 20 January 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 20 May 2004.  On 22 June 2004, I 
convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to find Applicant eligible for occupying an information systems 
position.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 1 July 2004.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C--Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised dual citizenship for Iran and the U.S. (&para; 1.a) and possessed an Iranian passport (&para; 1.b).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts 
in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he possesses an Iranian passport.  DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The possession of a 
foreign passport is the exercise of dual citizenship.  DC E2.A3.1.2.1; <EM>see</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-02270 (Aug. 29, 2003).  A clearance must "be denied or revoked 
unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."  
emo. from Arthur L. Money, Asst Sec. Def. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD 
Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline</EM> (Aug. 16, 2000).  Applicant's failure to 
provide evidence he surrendered his Iranian passport to the issuing authority precludes me from finding for him on &para; 1.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's wife and two children were citizens of Iran residing in the U.S. (&para; 2.a); his parents, who are permanent U.S. residents, 
are citizens and residents of Iran (&para; 2.b); his father-in-law is a citizen resident of Iran (&para; 2.c); Applicant traveled to Iran for extended stays in 1997, 1997-98, 
September 1999, March 2000, and October 2002 (&para; 2.d); and his wife owns an apartment in Iran (&para; 2.e).  A security risk may exist when an applicant's 
immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of record clearly established that Applicant's wife and parents are permanent U.S. residents, but Iranian citizens; his in-laws are citizen residents 
of Iran; and he traveled to Iran on several occasions.  A security concern is raised when an applicant has immediate family members, or persons to whom the 
applicant has close ties of affection or obligation, are citizens, resident, or present in a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is a rebuttable presumption that 
an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of his spouse."  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 
(App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a mitigating condition if the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the applicant to choose between loyalty to the family members and loyalty to the U.S.  Although Applicant's family members are not 
agents of a foreign power, they are in a vulnerable position.  The U.S. Government does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and recent tensions have 
"increased the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests abroad posed by those who oppose U.S. policy."  Ex. 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence established Applicant's children are now U.S. citizens, his travels to Iran were before he became a U.S. citizen, and his wife no longer owns an 
apartment in Iran.  Although I have do doubt Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen, the presence of members of his immediate family in Iran for substantial periods 
of time put him in a position of vulnerability.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
