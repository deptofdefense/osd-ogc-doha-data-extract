<P>Applicant is approximately $23,000 in arrears on child support payments for his seven children and was convicted of food-stamp fraud in 1996.  Although his 
arrearages are slowly being reduced by the state garnishing his wages, Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 25 June 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-31499.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-31499.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 1 August 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 12 November 2003.  On 11 December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 31 
December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 39 years old.  He owed approximately $28,000 in child support for seven children when the SOR was issued.  Answer.  Applicant had four children 
with his girlfriend before marrying someone else.  He had three children with his wife.  They have since divorced and he is now married to someone else.  
Applicant is making child support payments and paying on the arrearages through garnishment of his pay.  Applicant is unsure of many of the details of his 
support obligation.  At the time of the hearing, it appeared Applicant still owed approximately $23,000.  Ex. J.  </P> 
 
<P>In 1996, in accordance with his guilty plea, Applicant was convicted of food-stamp fraud.  The imposition of a sentence was suspended for three years, he was 
ordered to pay restitution, earn a high school diploma or GED, and perform community service.  Ex. 5 at 9-10</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had three delinquent debts to the county government totaling over $28,000 (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.c.); he is not capable of paying these 
debts (&para; 1.d.); and he was convicted of food-stamp fraud in 1996 (&para; 1.e.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR.  Applicant has a history of not 
meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and being unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Furthermore, his conviction for food-stamp fraud demonstrates a deceptive or illegal financial practice.  DC E2.A6.1.2.2.  Applicant failed to establish that any of the mitigating factors under the 
guideline apply.  It appears the child support debt is being slowly reduced only because Applicant's wages are being garnished.  There is no evidence of a good-faith effort to repay or resolve the debts.  </SPAN>Applicant believes his child support arrearages are "like almost paying for a car.  Everybody is paying for cars now.  
At the rate I'm going right now it says it will roughly be about eight years to pay it back."  Tr. 34.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not established it is in the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
