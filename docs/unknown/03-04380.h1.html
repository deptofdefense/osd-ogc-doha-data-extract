<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he accrued during his four-year military tour of service. He has been unable to address these debts in the ensuing 
years following his discharge due to the lack of good paying work.  He has failed to document any progress with his either his individual or consolidated 
repayment efforts.  Applicant successfully refutes allegations of falsification of his security clearance application (SF-86) by a demonstrated misunderstanding 
of the status of his debts and the scope of his listing requirements.  Nevertheless, clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 3, 2004 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on 
August 12, 2004.  A hearing was convened on August 12, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, 
continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses 
(including himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on August 24, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing Applicant asked that the record be kept open to permit him time to supplement the record with documentation of payments to 
certain of his creditors and his new debt consolidation service.  There being no objection from the Government, and for good cause shown, Applicant was 
granted until October 1, 2004 to supplement the record.  Department Counsel, in turn, was granted one day to respond.  Applicant was later granted additional 
extensions of time to supplement the record, which he failed to take advantage of before the closing of the record on February 8, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 1991, (b) accumulated numerous delinquent debts between 
1994 and 2003 (10 in all totaling over $3,900.00), which he has failed to pay or otherwise resolve, and &copy;) insufficient monthly income, as evidenced by his 
personal financial statement executed in September 2003, to resolve his delinquent debts.  Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security 
clearance application (SF-86) of April 2002 by omitting his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.  For his response to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted most of the allegations without explanation, denying only the allegations of falsifying his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 35-year-old former security guard for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR, and admitted to 
by Applicant, are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After graduating from high school, Applicant incurred a number of debts he had trouble  keeping  up with and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in March 
1991 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 7).  The bankruptcy court approved his discharge in July 1991 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1994 and 1998 Applicant served on active military duty; he was honorably discharged in February 1998.   While in military service, he compiled a 
considerable amount of additional debt, which he was unable to pay off before his discharge.  Following his discharge, he encountered renewed difficulty in 
finding gainful employment and suspended payment efforts on his old debts.  All together, Applicant accumulated 10 delinquent debts between 1994 and 2003 
(totaling over $3,900.00), which he has not been able to address with the income at his disposal. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Recently, Applicant committed to a debt consolidation service.  It is not clear when he signed up with this service, or how long he has been making the $125.00 
a month payments he claims to be paying to the service: His payment documentation comprises one copied check for $125.00 in May 2004 (<EM>see</EM> ex. A), but no 
more.  His income has been spotty since his military discharge.  He currently generates a little over $1,400.00 a month from his work as a licensed barber 
following two years of schooling.  With this income he has been able to cover his rent, necessities, and child support (initiated three to four months previous 
after paternity was proved), but little more with the small remainder (roughly $300.00) he has been able to accumulate (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 55-57).  With his 
current  debt consolidation plan, he believes he should be able to eventually pay off his old debts (R.T., at 69-73).  However, he can provide no time table of a 
pay off.  And with the extra post-hearing time afforded him to document any further repayment efforts, he has failed to do so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When executing his SF-86 in April 2002, Applicant omitted most of his delinquent debts (both those over 180 days and 90 days, respectively) when answering 
questions 38 and 39 of the questionnaire.  Applicant attributes his omissions to (a) memory failure on most of the debts that originated during his military 
service and (b) his belief he didn't have to list delinquent debts over seven years old (<EM>see </EM>ex. 4; R.T., at 35-36, 64).   Due to the age of his omitted debts (over 
six years old) and relatively small size of the debts (all but one under $500.00), he assures he could not remember most of them when answering questions 38 
(over180 days late) and 39 (over 90 days late).  Remembering what he could without any paper work to jog his memory, he listed his tire loan when answering 
question 38 and his furniture loan with creditor 1.h when answering question 39.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's longstanding failure to look into the status of his debts raises some troubling due diligence concerns.  The lack of due diligence by itself is not 
enough, however, to impute knowing and wilful falsification.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations of faulty memory and misunderstanding about the scope of questions 38 
and 39 of his SF-86 are not inherently implausible given the relative age and small amounts of the debts at issue and his lack of a credit report or debt 
documentation to jog his memory on his old debts.  His explanations are not disputed by the Government either: The Government in its closing suggested his 
omissions were not intentional (citing his demonstration of candor in listing one of the covered debts and a previous job termination, his strong character 
references and his military service). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appraising Applicant's demeanor, the age of his debts, his demonstrated honesty in providing other adverse information asked of him in his SF-86 (<EM>e.g., </EM>his 
involuntary termination by a previous employer), the circumstances surrounding his claimed misunderstanding of the scope of the pertinent questions, and his 
memory limitations, he impresses as credibly mistaken about the status of his debts and the scope of the pertinent questions.  Overall, Applicant's explanations 
for his S-F omissions are plausible enough to avert findings of knowing and wilful omission and are accepted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by a close uncle (a former corrections officer of 13 years), who has known him since 1969.  Applicant is reputed to be a good 
father who sees his daughter every other weekend and stays current with his child support payments (R.T., at 81-85). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt while in the military that he was unable to resolve following his discharge with the minimal income he 
generated from his intermittent employment opportunities.  Altogether, Applicant accumulated over $3,900.00 of assorted consumer  debts, which he failed to 
discharge, either individually, or through initiated bankruptcy.  The Government's expressed security concerns in the SOR and their evidentiary presentations 
center on the amount of delinquent debt he compiled between 1994 and  his ensuing omissions of these debts from his pertinent answers to his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes his financial problems to the array of debts he accumulated both before he entered the Marine Corps in 1994 (which were discharged in 
bankruptcy) and during his four year military tour, which he was unable to keep up with following his 1998 discharge. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on Applicant's considerable accumulation of delinquent debt, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for Guideline F 
apply: DC E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  While his accrued 
debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., a </EM>lack of continuous gainful employment following his military discharge), for the most part 
his finances have permitted modest attempts to pay on his old tax creditors from income earned from his prior jobs and his more recent barbering trade. That he 
has not been able to document any further progress with his creditors in the six months that have elapsed since his hearing is unclear at this point, but is 
apparently related to his inability to find work following his separation by the defense security service that submitted his request for clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Resolution of Applicant's delinquent consumer debts is uncertain at this time.  His most recent efforts to utilize the services of a debt consolidation service are 
not developed enough to be able to make any favorable impressions about his prospects of paying off his creditors in the foreseeable future.  So, while his 
accrued consumer debts are extenuated to a considerable extent by his earnings limitations,  enough to enable him to invoke MC E2. A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) of the Guideline, he has made too little tangible progress with resolution of 
his debts over the past ten years (dating to his military service) to mitigate financial concerns sufficiently to enable him to invoke MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The 
behavior was not recent</EM>) of the Guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Where (as here) there is insufficient evidence of repayment efforts after the conditions that contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the 
Appeal Board has cautioned against crediting the applicant with either non-recent financial difficulties or excusing him from addressing his delinquent debts 
(even those accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's claimed difficulties in finding good paying employment following his military discharge 
and his inability to document any kind of payment plan with the resources he has had available to him from his past and current work, Applicant fails to 
mitigate the Government's security concerns at this time.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l of the 
allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification Concerns</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant's documented omissions of his covered delinquent debts from the SF-86 he completed in April 2002.  His 
omissions are, however, attributable to his mistaken uncertainty over the identity of his delinquent debts and whether they were too dated to require listing in 
his SF-86.  Applicant's  judgment lapses are not enough to impute knowing and wilful falsification under either Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations of his omissions (misunderstanding the age of his debts and the scope of required listing) are persuasive enough to avert inferences of 
knowing and wilful omission.  There being no misconduct substantiated, no need to show extenuation or mitigation arises.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-13568 
(February 13, 2004).  While Applicant's efforts lack due diligence inquiries of the state of his debts,  his efforts reveal enough mistaken reliance on the 
unknown state of his debts and scope of required listing to enable him to refute the allegations of falsification of his SF-86 covered in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b 
under Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
