<P>The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that she has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.  She was also was 
clearly less than candid about the repossession of her vehicle when she answered question 35 on her June 1999 Security Clearance Application.  This wilful 
falsification is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 31, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 7, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on April 25, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  In the FORM, the Department Counsel explained, in no uncertain terms, the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responds that she has already paid some debts and has consolidated the remaining debts in order to make regular payments to a collection 
agency.  For the Applicant to benefit from mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.6, however, she must demonstrate proof that she has "initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."  She may for example submit copies of payment receipts or creditor agreements indicating that she has 
satisfied her debts or initiated repayment plans.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received her copy of the FORM on May 8, 2002, and Applicant's one page unsworn Response was received on or about June 10, 2002.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on September 17, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted financial difficulties, lack of 
candor and related criminal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 32 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.o By her own admission, the Applicant is indebted to 13 different creditors in the amount of about $8,100.00 in past due indebtedness (Item 2, and Item 6 
at pages 1~3).  She avers that $4,000.00 of this indebtedness is due to the unexpected illness of her son, and the remainder is due to her loss of employment 
(Item 2 at page 1).  She claims to be addressing all of her past due indebtedness, but offers nothing to support this bare allegation (Item 2, and Response).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  In answering question 35 on her June 1999 Security Clearance Application (SCA), the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to disclose that her vehicle 
was voluntarily repossessed in 1995 (Item 4 at page 11).  She only disclosed the existence of the repossession to the Government nine months later when she 
executed a sworn statement in March of 2000 (Item 5 at page 3).  This lack of candor is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  In answering questions 38 and 39 on her June 1999 SCA, the Applicant, relying on the bad advice of a "general clerk" working for her employer, failed to 
disclose any of her past due indebtedness (Item 2 at page 4).  Although this clerk was not authorized to give such advice, I find that the Applicant's intent was 
not to deceive the Government in answering "No" to the posited questions.  She thought the clerk was authorized to give such advice, and relied upon it in 
filling out the SCA (Item 2 at page 4, and Item 5 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her Response, the Applicant avers she "will soon have a free financial slate," but again offers nothing in support of this bare assertion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, . . . unexpected medical emergency . . . );</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), 
which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an 
applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective 
or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, <STRONG>the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence</STRONG> in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the 
past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  
Furthermore, an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to 
place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's in excess of $8,000.00 in past due indebtedness, in her March 2000 sworn statement, the Applicant averred she intended to 
resolve her outstanding indebtedness.  In the April 2002 FORM, Department Counsel candidly informed the Applicant what she may submit to satisfy her 
burden of proof and rebut the Government's case.  Despite having more than two years to garner the suggested documentation, in answering the FORM, the 
Applicant offers no documentation, whatsoever.  In a one page unsworn letter, she merely avers that she is addressing the Government's concern.  Clearly the 
Applicant has not met her burden; and as such, Guideline F is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the Applicant unwittingly relied upon bad advice in responding to questions regarding her Financial Delinquencies on her June 1999 SCA, she  was 
clearly less than candid with the Government in answer to question 35, as to her voluntary repossession. The posited question is clear and unequivocal, but her 
answer was "No."  This wilful falsification is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  Guidelines E and J are therefore also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her Financial Difficulties, Personal Conduct and related Criminal 
Conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E, F and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not 
met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E, F and J.</SPAN></P>
