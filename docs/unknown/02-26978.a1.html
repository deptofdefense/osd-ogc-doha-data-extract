  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Administrative Judge imposed on him an impossible burden of proof or a burden of proof inconsistent with the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  It was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to make predictive judgments about  Applicant's security eligibility.  There is no right to a security clearance and no presumption in favor of granting or continuing one.  Applicant has not rebutted  the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not  sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's evaluation of the record evidence was arbitrary or capricious, or inconsistent with the whole person concept.  The errors  identified by the Applicant are harmless in nature.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated March 3, 2004 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Joan Caton Anthony issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated February 28, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge imposed on Applicant a burden of proof that is impossible to meet; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge failed to properly consider Applicant's statement that he would not succumb to threats to his family; and (3) whether the 
Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge imposed on Applicant a burden of proof that is impossible to meet</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts the Administrative Judge imposed 
an impossible burden of proof on him that has the practical effect of nullifying the Adjudicative Guidelines.  This claim of error involves the Judge's 
consideration of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-26978.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P> and her conclusion that it did not apply in this case to Applicant's relatives living in Jordan and 
Syria.  Applicant argues that the Judge's disposition of Mitigating Condition 1 had the effect of requiring Applicant to show that the foreign countries in 
question would never in the future attempt to coerce its residents in order to influence Applicant to disclose classified information, and that such a burden was 
impossible to meet.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel is not required to present direct evidence of a nexus between an applicant's conduct and circumstances and an unfavorable security 
clearance decision.  <EM>Gayer v</EM>. <EM>Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  Nor is Department Counsel required to prove that an applicant poses an 
imminent or clear and present danger to national security before an unfavorable security clearance decision can be made.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-09907 
(March 17, 2004) at p. 7; ISCR Case No. 00-0596 (October 4, 2001) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 99-0068 (November 30, 1999) at p. 6.  Moreover, the federal 
government is not required to grant security clearances to applicants unless it is affirmatively shown that a particular applicant has been specifically targeted by 
a foreign country for intelligence gathering purposes.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-18860 (March 17, 2003) at p. 7; ISCR Case No. 02-09907 (March 17, 2004) 
at pp. 7-8.  Apart from the practical consideration that both parties have limited access to information about covert intelligence gathering activities by foreign 
countries and organizations, the federal government is not precluded from denying or revoking access to classified information based on facts and 
circumstances that raise security concerns but have not yet resulted in an actual breach.  <EM>See Adams v</EM>. <EM>Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969, (<EM>cert</EM>. 
<EM>denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Applicant's right to due process does not change the substantive law governing security clearance adjudications, and does not 
relieve Applicant of the heavy burden of persuasion imposed on all applicants by Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-00318 
(February 25, 2004) at p. 9. </P> 
<P>Applicant acknowledges that in earlier cases the Board has taken the positions set forth in the preceding paragraph and that the Board has earlier rejected 
arguments postulating an impossible burden of proof.  He now urges the Board to reconsider its prior reasoning in light of new argument and case law set forth 
in his appeal brief.  Applicant argues (a) an administrative decision requiring an unerring prediction of the future is an impossible burden of proof rendering 
decisions under these circumstances arbitrary and capricious and (b) where the facts are uniquely within the peculiar knowledge of one party, the burden of 
proving those facts shifts to that party, otherwise there is a presumption in favor of the other party.  Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's decision 
and the prior rulings of the Board violate both of these propositions by requiring Applicant to prove that any country would never attempt to influence its 
citizens at any time.  Applicant's argument is not persuasive.</P> 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about whether a person may be at risk to fail to properly handle 
classified information.  <EM>Department of the Navy v</EM>. <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  To the extent that DOHA administrative judges are required to assess 
current risk by making predictive judgments about the likelihood of future conduct or circumstances, their actions parallel determinations made in other areas of 
the law.<A HREF="02-26978.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  By suggesting that the reasoning of the Judge and the Board puts Applicant to the impossible task of predicting the future, Applicant's argument 
goes too far.  As in any other area of DOHA jurisprudence, application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is not predicated on precise predictions of 
the future.  Rather, an administrative judge is required to make predictive judgments about the likelihood of a current and future risks based on present 
circumstances.  The circumstances presented by the location of Applicant's relatives in Jordan and Syria is certainly a matter that is susceptible to proof.  
oreover, the cases cited by Applicant stating that a party bears the burden of producing evidence uniquely within its powers to obtain are readily 
distinguishable from this case.  As stated in a prior paragraph, both parties are handicapped when it comes to gathering evidence about the covert intelligence 
practices of a foreign country.  When it comes to the specific  circumstances of Applicant and his relatives in a foreign country, however, it can hardly be said 
that Applicant is in a position of disadvantage relative to the position of Department Counsel concerning the ability to produce evidence about those 
circumstances.  Applicant's arguments on these points do not persuade the Board to reconsider its past responses to "impossible burden of proof" arguments nor 
do they persuade the Board that the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 was error.</P> 
<P>Implicit in Applicant's arguments is the premise that he is entitled to a favorable security clearance decision unless the federal government affirmatively 
establishes he is not entitled to receive such a favorable decision.  That premise runs afoul of the following legal principles: there is no right to a security 
clearance, there is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing one, and the federal government can resolve doubts in favor of the national security rather 
than in favor of an applicant.  Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.2; <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529.  Although Department Counsel has the burden of 
presenting evidence to prove controverted facts, Department Counsel does not have the burden of affirmatively disproving the applicability of an Adjudicative 
Guidelines mitigating condition.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-09907 (March 17, 2004) at p. 7; ISCR Case No. 01-20908 (November 26, 2003) at p. 3; ISCR 
Case No. 01-24306 (September 30, 2003) at p. 6.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to properly consider Applicant's statement that  he would not succumb to threats to his family</SPAN>.  Applicant argues 
that the Administrative Judge did not mention his statement that he would not betray the United States if his family were threatened and that he would report 
any such threats to the proper authorities.  He submits that this failure to mention his statement is an indication that the Judge gave Applicant's statement no 
weight whatsoever.  For the reasons that follow, Applicant's argument does not persuade the Board that the Judge acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</P> 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.   <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  To rebut or overcome that presumption, an appealing party must do more than simply disagree with the Judge's 
weighing of the record evidence, or cite record evidence that is not specifically discussed or mentioned in the Judge's decision.  Applicant's statements about 
what he would do if his family were threatened are record evidence that the Judge had to consider.  The Judge had to decide whether the testimony was 
plausible, and if so, what weight (if any) to give that testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Even if the Judge concluded that Applicant's 
testimony was plausible, the Judge's obligation to consider that testimony did not compel the Judge to give it any particular weight, or any weight at all.  The 
Board has declined to hold that an applicant's statements about what he or she would do if family members were threatened are not admissible or not entitled to 
be taken into account by a Judge.  However, the Board has noted the limited value of such statements because they involve only a prediction by an applicant 
about what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of circumstances.  The Board has also noted that in considering the applicability of 
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, the key issue is whether the status and circumstances of an applicant's relatives in other countries might put the 
applicant in a position where he is forced to choose between his loyalty to his family and his loyalty to the United States.  Thus, Applicant's statement as to 
what he might do when presented with such a choice is of limited relevance.</P> 
<P>3.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge noted that Jordan was a country beset by 
civil unrest and had been on the front lines in the war against international and regional terrorism.  The Judge noted that Syria is included on the State 
Department list of state sponsors of terrorism.  The Judge concluded that Applicant's close familial and friendship ties with and obligations to relatives in 
Jordan and Syria created the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information and that this concern has not been 
mitigated.  On appeal, Applicant maintains that the Judge failed to offer a rationale to support her conclusions.  Applicant argues variously: (a) Jordan is a 
friendly country with a consistently pro-Western foreign policy and traditionally has had close relations with the United States; (b) Applicant's father's ties to 
Jordan, which include only his receipt of a modest military pension and ownership of property in Jordan worth $140,000, are not of security significance; (c) 
Applicant's brother's position as a professor at a Jordanian University, and Applicant's casual relationship with his brother negate any possible security 
concerns arising out of their relationship; (d) Applicant's sister, a dual citizen of the United States and Jordan living in Jordan, is not an employee of the 
Jordanian government or any other government and is not in a position to be exploited; (e) Applicant has only a casual relationship with his sister-in-law and 
she is not in a position to be exploited; (f) The record evidence does not support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant has ties of familial obligation 
to his first cousins in Jordan and his second cousin in Syria; (g) the Administrative Judge failed to provide a rationalization for her formal finding that 
Applicant's travel to Jordan, Syria, and Israel was security clearance disqualifying; and (h) the Administrative Judge ignored mitigating evidence and failed to 
employ the "whole person" concept.  The Board interprets these various arguments as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  While Applicant's arguments have mixed merit, the Board concludes that the Judge's overall adverse security 
clearance decision is sustainable.</P> 
<P>The Board finds no merit in Applicant's assertions regarding the previously enumerated arguments (a) through (e) and argument (h).  After a review of the 
record evidence and the Administrative Judge's decision, the Board concludes that in these instances the Judge's findings are reasonably supported by the 
record evidence and her conclusions flow logically from her findings.  The Board also concludes that Applicant has failed to overcome the presumption that the 
Judge considered all the record evidence, both unfavorable and mitigating.  Applicant correctly notes that when making a security clearance decision the 
Administrative Judge should evaluate an applicant's conduct and circumstances under the whole person concept.  See Directive, Section 6.3; and Enclosure 2, 
Items E2.2.1 and E.2.2.3.  However, Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole person concept.  In his 
various arguments, Applicant essentially sets forth an alternate interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant's ability to do so is not sufficient to demonstrate 
the Judge failed to apply the whole person concept, or that the Judge erred when she determined that Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence in 
mitigation.  Merely because a Judge makes adverse findings and draws adverse conclusions, it does not follow that the Judge is failing to apply the whole 
person concept or is weighing the evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 02-06194 (July 15, 2004) at p. 4. </P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant failed to rebut the presumption that he has ties of obligation to his first cousins and his second cousin 
(hereinafter "cousins").  She found that his contacts with his cousins were not casual but bear "strong overtones of familial commitment."<A HREF="02-26978.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>  On appeal, 
Applicant points out that Applicant's cousins are not immediate family members and the record evidence does not support the Judge's conclusion that 
Applicant has ties of familial affection or obligation to these people.  Applicant's contention has merit.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge erred to the extent that her findings and conclusions about Applicant's ties of affection or obligation to his cousins are based on a 
presumption.  While the Board on numerous occasions has indicated that there is a presumption that an Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation with 
immediate family members, which includes Applicant's parents, siblings and children, Applicant's cousins do not fall into this category.<A HREF="02-26978.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The Board has noted 
the necessity of differentiating between immediate family members and other relatives.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (February 20, 2002) at p. 3.  Absent 
the presumption, the relationship between Applicant and his cousins is properly characterized solely by reference to the record evidence.  The record evidence 
in this case establishes only brief, sporadic contact between Applicant and his cousins over a time span of many years.  There is no evidence that reasonably 
supports findings of ties of familial affection or obligation between these individuals.  While the Judge could consider the significance of the fact that Applicant 
has cousins in Jordan and Syria in the context of her overall security clearance decision and could give this evidence appropriate weight, her mischaracterization 
of the relationships was error.  However, the Board finds that this error is harmless in light of the findings and conclusions of the Judge that are sustainable.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge made a formal finding against Applicant under subparagraph 1.l. of the SOR.<A HREF="02-26978.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P>   The allegation cites several trips taken by Applicant 
to Jordan, Syria, and Israel.  In her decision, the Judge mentions the fact that the travel took place but engages in no further discussion as to why the travel is 
significant from a security standpoint.  On appeal, Applicant asserts that without a rationale as to why the travel was significant, it was error for the Judge to 
make a formal finding against Applicant.  Applicant's contention has merit.  The record evidence indicates that the Applicant's travels to Jordan and Syria were 
largely a function of his desire to visit relatives whose presence in those countries is the essential component of this case.  There is no clear record evidence that 
would give independent security significance to Applicant's travels as set forth in the SOR.  Given this posture, it was error for the Judge not to elaborate the 
specific reasons why Applicant's travel warranted a negative formal finding under subparagraph 1.l. of the SOR.  However, the Board finds that this error is 
harmless in light of the overall record and the adverse findings and conclusions of the Judge that are reasonably supported by the record.</P>

<P>I agree with the majority opinion.  I am writing separately to address a point raised in Applicant's brief.  Applicant refers to my separate opinion in ISCR Case 
No. 02-04786.  That  reference is misplaced.  My separate opinion, on its face, regarded a fact pattern fairly categorized as estranged relatives.  Indeed, the word 
estranged was underlined in the separate opinion.  Nothing in Applicant's case suggests that he is estranged from his immediate family members residing in 
Jordan.  The two cases are easily distinguished.</P>
