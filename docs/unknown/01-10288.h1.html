<P>Security concerns remain over Applicant's foreign preference galvanized by his dual citizenship and his repeated use of his  foreign passport (which 
he renewed in December 2000) after he became a naturalized United States (US) citizen in April1992 and had a US passport.  He traveled on his 
Lebanese passport 17 times, including a July 2001 visit after he received the Statement of Reasons (SOR) expressing security concerns over this 
use.  In January 2001 he stated that he would relinquish the passport if necessary, but he did not chose to do so until September 2001.  His mere 
assertion of an exclusive preference for the US is insufficient.  On the other hand he has mitigated the allegations of foreign influence.  Although his 
wife and his relatives are citizens of a foreign country, there is no evidence that they have ties to the government, are agents of a foreign power, or 
could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that would force him to choose between his ties to them and to the US.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government could not reach the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant,<A HREF="01-10288.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> so the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on 
July 12, 2001.  The SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C) and in paragraph 2 over foreign 
influence (Guideline B).  Applicant received the SOR and replied to these SOR allegations in an Answer of July 30, 2001, and admitted allegations 
1.b.,  1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.  He requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to Department Counsel who on August 30, 2001, attested it was 
Ready to Proceed.</P> 
 
<P>On August 30, 2001, the case was assigned to me.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing 
was issued on September 6, 2001, which set the matter for September 27, 2001, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the 
hearing the Government introduced two exhibits which were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-2).   Applicant testified himself and offered three 
exhibits (Exhibits A, B, &amp; C) which were admitted into evidence.  He and the government requested that the record be left open for him to submit 
additional exhibits; and he was given until October 9, 2001, to submit his additional exhibits.  (TR 15-16)  Department Counsel was given two 
days until October 11, 2001, to review and submit her comments.  (TR 63-66, 72-73).  After the hearing Applicant forwarded five documents 
(Exhibits D, E, F, G, &amp; H); as the government counsel did not object, those documents were admitted into evidence on October 11, 2001.  The 
record then closed.  The  transcript (TR) was received on October 10, 2001.</P>

</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Clarification</STRONG> <STRONG>of Department of Defense Policy on Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Department of Defense issued a policy memorandum on August 16, 2000.  It clarified the policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C and 
stated, in part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign 
passport.  The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no 
mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only 
applicable mitigation factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns 
underlying this guideline are that possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's 
allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent 
application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United State Government.  Modification of the Guideline is not required.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel attested that this policy was sent to Applicant as an attachment to his SOR on July 12, 2001; he received the documents on 
July 18, 2001.  (TR 59-61)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of 
Fact:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 39 years old, is the president of a United States (US) company (Company #1) where he has worked from 1992 to present.  Company 
#1 does business with federal agencies; two years ago he was asked to obtain a security clearance for his corporation for a research project.  
Previously, neither he nor his firm needed a security clearance.  His firm has been awarded numerous awards for development of defense related 
technologies.  As an officer of the company he also is required to have a security clearance before the company can have a facility security 
clearance.  In May 2000 he completed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) 
to seek a security clearance.  He has been an associate professor at a university in State #1 where he taught from 1984-96.  He studied at another 
university in State #1 from 1988-91.  He married his wife in September 1993, and she has an US alien registration number.  (Exhibit 1; Exhibit F; 
TR 12, 44-49; 55-56)  </P> 
 
<P>In April 1983 he received a BS in mechanical engineering from a State #1 university; he received a MS in engineering in August 1984 from another 
university in State #1.  (TR 46; Exhibit F) </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Syria as his parents were temporarily living there; but when he was still a baby his family returned to Lebanon where he 
lived until 1980 when he came to the US to study.  He became a naturalized US citizen in April 1992, but he maintained his Lebanese citizenship  
(1) because the US permits it and (2) because of the historical significance of his Lebanese citizenship.  In Lebanon government representation is 
based on religious population based on a survey of citizens.  As his parents, sisters, brother and families still live in Lebanon, his standing as a 
citizen adds to the census and helps to strengthen their representation in the government.  Also his holding Lebanese citizenship made travel to 
Lebanon to visit his family much easier.  He "feel[s] absolutely no loyalty to the Lebanese government, or what it stands for."  When interviewed in 
January 2001, he stated that he felt no need "to renounce" his Lebanese citizenship "just to demonstrate my loyalty to the US."  He would 
seriously consider renouncing his Lebanese citizenship only "if required."  When he lived in Lebanon he had a bank account; when he traveled to 
the US he withdrew all of the funds; Initially he was not certain whether or not it was closed, but upon investigation he learned he does not have a 
bank account in Lebanon.  His father gave him real estate in the mountains of Lebanon as a gift, but he states that the value of the property is 
minimal.  He offered no documentation to support his assessment on the value of the property.  At the time it was given to him in 1988 the value 
was $15,000.  He estimated the property would be worth $10,000 if sold now.  Another solution he proffered was to give the property back to 
his father; however, he offered no evidence he took that path.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; Exhibit F; TR 21-22, 25-29, 31-32, 56-57)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not relinquish his Lebanese passport when he became a US citizen.  </P> 
 
<P>&bull; Indeed he has used it for entering Lebanon seventeen times in the last nine years since he became a naturalized US citizen.  He used his US 
passport for all other travel.  </P> 
 
<P>&bull; When his Lebanese passport expired in December 2000, he renewed it for five years as holding a Lebanese passport considerably eases his 
travel into Lebanon as he does not have to obtain a visa or pay the fee of $70 required if he were to enter on his US passport.   </P> 
 
<P>&bull; When interviewed in January 2001, he stated that he would relinquish the passport if necessary to obtain a security clearance as his responsibility 
is to the success of his company and his employees.   </P> 
 
<P>&bull; After he received the SOR, he again used his Lebanese passport from July 31 to August 8,  2001 to travel to a meeting of engineers where he 
gave a talk; he thought the trip would benefit his business.  While he could have used his US passport, he would have had to apply for a visa.</P> 
 
<P>&bull; In his July 2001 Answer to the SOR he stated his willingness to surrender this passport as required by the August 16, 2000, Department of 
Defense policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C.  He received the policy letter with his SOR in July 2001.  </P> 
 
<P>&bull; Applicant finally took the initiative himself a few days before his hearing to surrender his Lebanese passport by sending it via certified mail on 
September 22, 2001, to the General Consulate of Lebanon.  On September 27, 2001, the Consul General confirmed receipt and noted his 
passport had been canceled.  </P> 
 
<P>(Answer; Exhibits 2, Exhibits A, E; TR 19-21, 29-31, 38-41, 50-52, 58-59, 60-63)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant expects to live out his life in the US; and his family is rooted in American culture.  He has never served in any military service and has no 
obligation to do so.  He does not vote in Lebanon and never sought or held political office there.  (Answer; Exhibit 2, Exhibit F)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife of is a citizen of Lebanon who recently became eligible to apply for US citizenship as she has lived here since 1993.  He has three 
children who hold dual citizenship because they were born in the US of Lebanese parents, and he expects them to maintain their dual citizenship.  
His mother and father are in their 70's and hold no government positions.  He has close relations with his relatives; his parents, sister, three 
brothers; their families are citizens of Lebanon and currently reside in Lebanon.  He is continuing his contact with his family through letters and 
telephone calls and visits frequently.  He provides no financial assistance to any of his family members in Lebanon and does not discuss his business 
with them.   His father and brothers are in the printing business and are wealthy; his sister is an insurance agent.  His wife's father lives in Liberia, 
Africa; but Applicant has no contact with him.  (Answer;  Exhibit 2; TR 22-24, 32-34, 36)</P> 
 
<P>He has extensive business contacts in Europe and travels there once a month on a US passport; he also does business in Mexico. He has also 
traveled to China to do some research with some universities and a company there.   (TR 34-36)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he

These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.

applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference     </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>If an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, this conduct raises a security concern 
under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, as the individual may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of 
the United States.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  the exercise of dual citizenship; (2)  
possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Further, DoD policy clarification of August 16, 2000 explains that  "possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport" may be a disqualifying<A HREF="01-10288.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> condition and to mitigate an Applicant must surrender his foreign passport or  obtain official approval for 
its use.</P> 
 
<P> Security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign preference arise from his active exercise of dual citizenship as he has maintained his 
citizenship in Lebanon even after he became a naturalized US citizen in April 1992.  While dual citizenship is not prohibited <EM>per se (</EM>and in that 
sense is sanctioned by policies of the United States), any conduct indicating possible foreign preference does raise a security concern where such 
action would increase the risk of an individual being influenced by the needs, desires, or aims of a foreign nation.  </P> 
 
<P> Applicant possessed a foreign passport and used it at least 17 times on his many trips to Lebanon even after he became a naturalized citizen of 
the US in April 1992 and after his US passport was issued to him.  Applicant chose to do so for convenience as a visa on his US passport would 
cost him $70 per visit.  When his Lebanese passport expired in December 2000, he renewed it for five years.  Even after he received the SOR 
explicitly raising security concerns over his use of a foreign passport, he again used his Lebanese passport to travel there for a meeting from July 31 
to August 8, 2001.  </P> 
 
<P> The DoD policy guidance furnishes an avenue for individuals to mitigate the security  concern: an applicant must either surrender the foreign 
passport or obtain official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government.  Applicant indicated in January 2001 
and again in July 2001 that he would surrender his passport if required to do so.  He finally voluntarily complied with this guidance in September 
2001, just a few days before his hearing.  </P> 
 
<P> Further, Applicant owns real estate in Lebanon and is closely linked to his wealthy family with a possible expectation of inheritance.  He has 
maintained his citizenship because of the historical significance: in Lebanon government representation is based on religious population based on a 
survey of citizens.  As his parents, sisters, brother and families still live in Lebanon, his standing as a citizen adds to the census and helps to 
strengthen their representation in the government. </P> 
 
<P>Thus, except for the isolated allegation that he "may own a bank account with a bank in Lebanon," Applicant failed to demonstrate he meets the 
mitigating conditions (MC).<A HREF="01-10288.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Since he denies he continues to have such an account, I find that allegation to be mitigated under MC 2., as that 
single indicator of possible foreign preference occurred before he obtained United States citizenship.  While he maintains that his principal 
preference is for the US that statement by itself does not establish the preference sufficiently under DoD security policy.  Applicant's repeated use 
of his foreign passport, continuing even in July 2001, after he was on notice by the SOR, casts doubt as to whether he can be counted on to make 
decisions without regard to Lebanon or his personal interests there.   While he submitted several references attesting to his good character, they 
did not appear personally and so there is no way to establish the extent of their knowledge of his continued use of his Lebanese passport over the 
nine year period after he became a naturalized US citizen.  While Applicant has now relinquished his foreign passport, that action has to be 
reviewed in the context of the history of all of his actions and his delay in doing so.  Further, he took no action to indicate he would fall within MC 
4 as he did not express any willingness to renounce his dual citizenship. In this case, after reviewing all of the evidence in the record and 
considering all of the security policies, including  the August 16, 2000, policy clarification memorandum, I conclude he has not met the DoD 
mitigation sufficiently to indicate his clear preference for the United States.  Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an 
applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances. <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 
528-29 (1988).  Acts indicative of foreign preference warrant careful scrutiny.  Hence, I decide SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 
1.c. and 1.e. against Applicant and 1.d. for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government also expressed security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a 
foreign country:  his wife is a citizen of Lebanon and recently became eligible to apply for US citizenship as she has lived her since 1993.  His 
parents and siblings are citizens of Lebanon.  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security risk may exist when an 
individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the 
United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise 
of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations 
if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include:  (1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, 
or resident or present in, a foreign country.  Applicant has relatively  frequent contacts with his family in Lebanon.</P> 
 
<P>However, these security concerns are mitigated by the fact that Applicant's relatives  have no ties to their foreign government; nor is there any 
substantial likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence over Applicant. Merely because of these family ties Applicant is not vulnerable to 
duress.  Given his history of responsible conduct and his clear statement that he does not discuss business-related matters with his family in 
Lebanon, I think it improbable that his family would create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security 
eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988). While 
acts indicative of foreign influence warrant careful scrutiny, after considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, here I conclude these ties do not raise such concerns.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.b. in 
Applicant's favor.</P>
