<P>Applicant, a 31-year old drafter for a defense contractor, was convicted of a breaking into a motor vehicle felony charge in 1990, and later sentenced to one to 
five years of  imprisonment (suspended).  Applicant's conduct is covered by the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), which bars persons sentenced to more 
than one year of incarceration, regardless of time actually served, from ever holding a security clearance, absent a waiver (which is recommended here).  
Applicant is highly regarded by his spouse, friends, neighbors, management and work associates as a person who is hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  
Clearance is denied.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of the <EM>per se</EM> security clearance bar mandated by the Smith Amendment.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 14, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on April 14, 2003, and was 
scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on May 8, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on three 
witnesses (including himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on May 16, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the hearing, Applicant faxed post-hearing submissions for consideration: a letter from the girlfriend (Ms. G) he was convicted of assaulting in 1994, 
a personal statement from the Applicant covering his past judgement lapses and corrective steps he has taken to change his life around, and a letter from his 
supervisor supplementing his trial testimony.  Department Counsel does not object to either Ms. G's letter or Applicant's own statement, and they are admitted 
as exhibits F and G, respectively.  Department Counsel does object to the admission of the statement from Applicant's supervisor, for reasons of the letter's 
being both cumulative and outside of the proceedings.  Taking into account both the cumulative effect of the supervisor's letter and the absence of any 
Applicant reservation to supplement the record, Department Counsel's objection must be sustained.  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 31-year old drafter for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is alleged to have been twice arrested in his home state: once in March 1994 for assault and battery, for which he was found guilty and fined $254.25, 
and previously in April 1990 on two counts of petit larceny, two counts of breaking and entering a car, and unlawful entry into enclosed places, for which he 
was found guilty of one count of petit larceny (misdemeanor) and one count of breaking into a motor vehicle (Class F felony) and sentenced to serve one to five 
years in prison (suspended to one year of probation and house arrest).  By virtue of his 1990 felony conviction and sentence in excess of one year, Applicant's 
conduct is alleged to be covered by 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986, which disqualifies him from holding a security clearance, subject to a waiver approved by the Secretary 
of Defense in a meritorious case.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, with accompanying explanations.  He claimed his 1994 assault and battery arrest 
resulted from his trying to fend off his girlfriend who had become emotional after he told her he wanted to end their relationship.  He claimed the court would 
not listen to either his story or his supporting ex-girlfriend and chose to rely on police-produced physical evidence of redness around her wrists.  Addressing his 
earlier 1990 petit larceny misdemeanor and breaking and entering felony arrest/conviction, he claimed his initial sentence was suspended in favor of just one 
year of house arrest and probation (which he completed in February 1992), plus restitution for the damages he caused and the items stolen.  Except for the 
covered arrests/convictions in the SOR, Applicant claims he has had no other arrests and has since matured and stabilized with his supportive family.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's first of two arrests occurred in April 1990 when he was18 years of age.  I n the first incident, he was arrested by the local sheriff on two counts of 
petit larceny (a misdemeanor), two counts of breaking and entering a motor vehicle (a felony), and unlawful entry into enclosed places (a felony).  Applicant 
had accompanied a friend to an impoundment lot where his friend's car had been impounded.  While his friend took care of his business, Applicant broke into 
two vehicles and took beer from one and speakers and a radio from the other (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 40-41).   He was spotted by a lot employee, who began shooting at 
him.  Applicant was flushed out of the lot and the police were called.  On their arrival at the scene, the police arrested Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>At his trial in February 1991, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of petit larceny (a misdemeanor) and one count of breaking into a motor vehicle (a felony).  
He was sentenced by the magistrate  to serve a term of one to five years in prison.  The magistrate then suspended his sentence under the state's youthful 
offender's act and placed him on one year of probation and house arrest (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 35).  The remaining charges were dismissed.  Applicant began his 
probation period in February 1991 and completed it in February 1992 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 35, 41).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was also arrested in March 1994.  In this arrest he was charged with assault and battery on a female: his girlfriend, who he had been dating for about 
six months.  He had gone to the girl's home that evening to end their relationship.  She became very emotional and physical with him over his announced 
intentions.  In his effort to fend her off, he bruised her wrist.  Their struggle apparently roused neighbors who called the police to investigate the situation.  By 
the time the police arrived, he had left his girlfriend's home and drove away.  He was later stopped and arrested.  </P> 
 
<P>At his trial, his girlfriend (Ms. G) testified in his behalf and denied an assault had occurred.  However, because she (a)  had initially told the police Applicant 
had assaulted her and (b) bore physical red marks on her wrists to corroborate her claims, the court chose to treat her denials as recanted characterizations of her 
initial assault claims and found Applicant guilty of the assault charges and fined him $254.25.  Ms. G repeated her previous  court claims of Applicant's 
innocence at the hearing (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).  Without more to corroborate Ms. G's recanted claims, however, Applicant's evidence of his innocence lacks the probative 
weight necessary to overcome the force of his conviction.  His explanations do reveal considerable extenuating circumstances, which the court would seem to 
have taken into account as well with its limiting  punishment to a fine.</P> 
 
<P>Since his last arrest in 1994, Applicant has had no further arrests or confrontations with law enforcement authorities.  He has since married and shown 
considerable maturing and remorse for his previous judgment lapses (<EM>see</EM> ex. G).  Applicant is highly regarded by his friends and neighbors, as well as his senior 
managers and associates at work.  He is considered by all of his references to be hardworking, reliable and trustworthy (<EM>see</EM> ex. D).  Both his supervisor and his 
wife who testified on his behalf characterize him as particularly responsible and trustworthy in his work and with his children and family (s<EM>ee</EM> R.T., at 52-57).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In addition to adjudicating Smith Amendment cases in accordance with current Executive Order and DoD Directive/Regulatory guidance, including applicable 
due process procedures, the criteria provide for consideration of issues covered by provisions 1 and 4 of the Act without consideration of the statute, this for the 
purpose of developing as complete a record as possible to aid the responsible authority for making a recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense as to whether 
the case merits a waiver.  Revised Adjudicative Guidelines designed to implement the provisions of the Smith Amendment and supplement existing 
Adjudicative Guidelines<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive have been 
developed.  These revised Guidelines are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision of security clearance eligibility.</SPAN>  
E2.2 considerations comprise the following: the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, the frequency and 
recency of the conduct, the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct, the voluntariness of participation, the presence or absence of rehabilitation, 
the motivation for the conduct, the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>DoD's revised guidelines are, in turn, reinforced by DOHA Operating Instruction 64, which all judges are required to follow in their implementation of Smith 
Amendment-covered cases.</P> 
 
<P>Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy guidelines are pertinent herein:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC a  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC b  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC c   <STRONG>Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC a  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC f  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC g   <STRONG>Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of 
Defense or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of materiality, however, does 
not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a 
security clearance.  Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a meritorious employee of a defense contractor who as a young man was involved in a misdemeanor assault arrest/conviction and a more serious 
felony breaking into a vehicle conviction, for which he was sentenced</SPAN> to serve a term of one to five years in prison.  Placed on one year's probation as a 
condition of a suspended sentence pursuant to the state's youthful offender's act, Applicant completed his probation  in February 1992 and has had no further 
problems with law enforcement authorities.  Applicant is highly regarded by his friends and neighbors, as well as his senior managers and associates at work, as 
a person who can be relied on and trusted.  Not only does Applicant express deep remorse for his prior judgment lapses, but he demonstrates he has learned 
from his mistakes.  Applicant is by all credible accounts fully rehabilitated and an exemplary role model in his work, community and home.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>Applicant's non-Smith-related arrests</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is entitled to favorable conclusions with respect to the misdemeanor arrest/conviction covered by sub-paragraph 1.a, which are mitigated  under 
consideration of all of the facts presented.   The 1994 arrest/conviction attributed to Applicant involves a minor altercation with his girlfriend at the time, which 
both Applicant and Ms. G denied at trial.  The magistrate's levied small fine reflects credit to the extenuating circumstances presented by Applicant at his trial; 
even though, it was not enough to avert a conviction.  Applicant never resumed his relationship with Ms. G, and he has avoided any similar conduct since his 
1994 arrest/conviction.  The conduct is, accordingly, mitigated both by time and demonstrated rehabilitation.  Favorable conditions warrant with respect to the 
allegations covered by sub-paragraph 1.a  under Guideline J.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>Independent consideration of Smith Amendment related-conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By reliance on otherwise applicable mitigating conditions, Applicant's underlying actions leading to his 1990 petit larceny (misdemeanor) and breaking into a 
motor vehicle (felony) conviction could be considered dated and the result of youthful immaturity, and sufficient to warrant the benefit of revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines MC a (criminal behavior not recent) and MC f (there is clear evidence of rehabilitation) as well as overall favorable consideration taking into 
account the E.2.2 factors.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's satisfaction of his probation conditions and his evidence of his rehabilitation (based on the recommendations he has received from his spouse, 
friends, neighbors,  supervisor, senior managers and associates at work) demonstrate persuasive evidence of increased maturity, reliability and trust.  Weighed 
against the imputed judgment and trust lapses reflected in his 1990 breaking into a motor vehicle felony conviction, his prior mistakes should be considered 
sufficiently mitigated to entitle him to the renewed level of trusted judgment and reliability necessary to afford him continued access to classified information.  
Except for the Smith Amendment, Applicant's impressive post-release rehabilitation efforts would be enough to enable safe predictive judgments about his 
overall judgment, reliability and trustworthiness requisite for holding a security clearance entitling him to continued access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>However, consideration of Applicant's breaking into a motor vehicle conviction independent of the Smith Amendment is advisory only and cannot support a 
favorable or unfavorable formal finding without regard to application of the Smith Amendment and its waiver exception.  By and large courts at all levels lack 
jurisdiction to render advisory opinions absent statutory, regulatory or guiding policy authority.  <EM>Cf. Valley Baptist Medical Center v. Gonzales, </EM>33 S.W. 3d 821, 
822 (Tex. Sup. Ct. 2000). Only by virtue of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines implementing the Smith Amendment is authority extended to DOHA judges to 
make advisory assessments independent of the Smith Amendment's applicability.  This advisory assessment grant of authority does not extend to the crafting of 
formal findings.  As a result, any formal finding that follows from this advisory assessment must necessarily be conditioned on the adoption or not of a waiver 
of the Smith Amendment's mandatory clearance bar, which only the Secretary of Defense can grant in contractor cases (as here).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>Application of Smith Amendment</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As the result of Applicant's state felony conviction and one to five year prison term (suspended) (<EM>see </EM>sub-paragraph 1.b), his actions fall within the coverage of 
the Smith Amendment's provision 1.  With the passage of the Smith Amendment, Congress manifested a statutory purpose for raising the level of critical 
scrutiny of persons with histories of serious criminal actions and corresponding sentencing time.  Otherwise worthy cases become less amenable to 
reconciliation of perceived security risks than under pre-Smith Amendment assessments.  Under the adjudicative guidelines implementing the Smith 
Amendment, Applicant's completed probation and time in rehabilitation, while very encouraging, still cannot free him from coverage of the Amendments's 
mandatory bar, save for his qualification for waiver consideration.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Independent consideration of the mitigating conditions developed for assessing a  provision 1 situation falling under the Smith Amendment warrants further 
consideration of a waiver in this case in accordance with MC g of the revised guidelines.  Unfavorable conclusions are called for with respect to the allegations 
covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b and 1.c by virtue of the <EM>per se </EM>requirements of the Smith Amendment, subject to consideration of a meritorious waiver.. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) of the 
Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>
