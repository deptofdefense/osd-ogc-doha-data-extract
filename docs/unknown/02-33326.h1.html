<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old clerk for a defense contractor who has been a user and sometime abuser of alcohol who has had alcohol-related traffic offenses and 
made threatening phone calls after consuming alcohol. He continues to consume alcohol in quantities from 5-10 beers in an evening. </P> 
<P>He was the subject of a complaint about domestic violence, violation of a restraining order, and making harassing telephone calls. Applicant filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. Half of his liabilities were for gambling debts. Applicant continues to gamble after the bankruptcy discharge. Applicant omitted relevant 
information on his SF 86 relating to treatment and criminal complaints. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 22, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated January 20, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on March 10, 2004. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant responded with additional information on March 28, 2004, to which the government objected on May 11, 2004. The case was assigned to 
me on May 19, 2004. Applicant asked to withdraw the additional information on August 5, 2004. The request was granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old mail room clerk for a defense contractor who admitted some of the allegations in the SOR, denied others, but disagreed with the 
conclusions reached. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following additional findings of fact 
are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant has been a user and sometime abuser of alcohol who has had alcohol-related traffic offenses in 1991 and 1998 and made threatening phone calls after 
consuming alcohol in 2000 and 2001. He was terminated from his prior employment because of the phone calls. He continues to consume alcohol in quantities 
from 5-10 beers in an evening. </P> 
<P>Applicant was the subject of a complaint by a former girl-friend resulting in criminal charges of domestic violence, violation of a restraining order, and making 
harassing telephone calls. He was ordered to undergo domestic violence counseling. </P> 
<P>Applicant filed a petition in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 2001 that was discharged in January 2002. Half his liabilities were for gambling debts. Applicant 
continues to gamble after the bankruptcy discharge. </P> 
<P>Applicant omitted information on his SF 86 relating to treatment by a mental health professional (Question 19), civil court actions (Question 20), and the arrests 
and charges arising from complaints by his former girl-friend (Question 26). </P> 
<P>Applicant also denied he had received mental health counseling when interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service. He also lied to a police officer 
regarding the threatening phone call in 2001. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first allegation concerns Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline G of the Directive (E2.A7.1.2.1.) raises the issue of 
alcohol related incidents away from</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">work such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use and consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment 
(E2.A7.1.2.5.). The record of Applicant's</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">two offenses, convictions, and sentences clearly show that the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of alcohol abuse 
under Guideline G. Mitigating conditions are not applicable in that Applicant has not shown that the problems with abuse of alcohol have ended and that there 
is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.) No evidence was submitted of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's bankruptcy and continued gambling prompted the allegation of violation of Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at 
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history 
of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.), evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (E2.A6.1.2.3.), or financial problems that are linked to 
gambling. (E2.A6.1.2.5.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) could include the fact that the person has initiated a good faith effort to resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.) 
Applicant has not successfully mitigated this issue since gambling was a major contributing cause leading to his bankruptcy and he continues to gamble. While 
he blamed the investigator for coercing the admission of continued gambling, no evidence was produced to justify the claim. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegations of criminal conduct raise a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J relating to a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses 
(E2.A10.1.2.2.) and allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.). No mitigating 
conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged is Applicant's failure to report certain of the offenses under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). 
Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security 
concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) Applicant offered as an explanation for his failure to acknowledge the issues on his SF 86 that he mis-interpreted 
the question. I conclude that the omissions were deliberate as required in the guideline since he stated that he was embarrassed to admit and report his conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has shown by his testimony 
and appearance at the hearing as well as his supporting statements from supervisors and colleagues, that he has changed his conduct in the last four years and is 
a reliable, trustworthy, and credible person. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that the Applicant has not 
mitigated the allegations in the SOR and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
