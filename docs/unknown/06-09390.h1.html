<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a position of trust for Applicant. As required by <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan. 1987), as 
amended (Regulation), and </SPAN>Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 21 June 2006 detailing the 
basis for its decision--concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Regulation. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 30 August 
2006 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 16 October 2006. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on 15 November 2006 to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position of trust. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on 29 November 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old medical coder for a defense contractor that manages the civilian health care provided to military members and their dependents. She has worked there since September 
2004. She is currently out of work due to a broken wrist. As soon as her doctor clears her, she will return to her position with the defense contractor.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is single, but her unemployed 31-year-old daughter and three grandchildren live with her. The daughter does not assist Applicant financially with any of the family's living expenses. </P> 
 
<P>In January 2003 or 2004, Applicant's manufactured home, the contents of her home,  and her two cars were destroyed after fumes from the glue on recently installed flooring was ignited by her 
water heater.<A HREF="06-09390.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had 15 debts totaling more than $10, 700 that had been placed in collection status (&para;&para; 1.a-1.h, 1.j, 1.m-1.n, 1.p, 1.r-1.t), two debts totaling approximately 
$32,500 that had been charged off (&para;&para; 1.l, 1.q), two unpaid judgments totaling more than $2,260 (&para;&para;&nbsp;1.I, 1.o), and a delinquent debt with a balance of $8,698 after the resale of a repossessed 
automobile (&para;&nbsp;1.k). In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in &para;&para; 1.e, 1.g, 1.I, 1.k-1.l, 1.o-1.p, some with explanation, and denied the others.</P>

<P>On 13 September 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (PTPA) by certifying that her statements therein were true, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge and 
belief, and by acknowledging that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by fine and/or imprisonment under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Item 19 asked if, in the previous seven years, 
Applicant had any legal judgments rendered against her for a debt. Item 20 asked if Applicant was then delinquent more than 180 days on any loan or financial obligation. Applicant answered "no" 
to both questions.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process extends only to sensitive positions. Positions designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions; ADP III positions are not. Regulation &para;&nbsp;AP10.2. By 
memorandum dated 19 November 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security directed DOHA to extend the adjudication process to ADP III positions as 
well.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the 
person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security." Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the 
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive. 
Regulation &para; C8.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F--Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Regulation (app. 8) at 144.  Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, 
and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an applicant's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations (DC 1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC 3).</SPAN> She has delinquent debts totaling more than $50,000. </P> 
 
<P>An applicant may mitigate financial considerations security concerns by establishing that the behavior was not recent (MC 1); it was an isolated incident (MC 2); the conditions that resulted in the 
behavior were largely beyond the applicant's control; (MC 3); the applicant has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control (MC 4); or the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (MC&nbsp;6). Applicant's evidence has potentially raised MC 3.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant asserts that much of her financial difficulty can be traced to the fire that devastated her life. But many of her debts became delinquent before the fire, whether it occurred in 2003 or 2004. 
By January 2003 her delinquent accounts totaled more than $6,000. I have considered that Applicant's inability to resolve these debts has been exacerbated by the fire and the debts she incurred as a 
result. MC 3 applies. There is no indication Applicant is receiving counseling or that her debts are being resolved or are under control. It appears the allegation contained in SOR 1.t is the same as in 
&para; 1.r. Therefore, I find for Applicant on &para; 1.t.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In SOR &para; 2, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on her PTPA by deliberately failing to acknowledge that in the previous seven years she had two judgments rendered against her (&para;&nbsp;2.a), 
and by denying she had any debts that were then delinquent more than 180 days (&para;&nbsp;2.b). In her Answer, Applicant denied both allegations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not 
properly safeguard classified information. Regulation (app. 8) at 142. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The deliberate falsification or omission of relevant and material facts from any SCA is a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. DC 2. Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an applicant's background. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 469 at **13-14 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002). An applicant's financial history is a matter that could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant a 
clearance and her failure to disclose it would impede a thorough investigation of an applicant's background. Despite her insistence that she was ignorant of the judgments and delinquent debts when 
she completed her PTPA, I conclude she knew of them and deliberately failed to report them. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate personal conduct security concerns raised in allegations of falsifying a PTPA by establishing the information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of 
judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability (MC&nbsp;1); the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the applicant has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily (MC&nbsp;2); the 
applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts (MC&nbsp;3); the omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by 
improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided (MC&nbsp;4); the individual has taken positive steps to significantly 
reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress (MC&nbsp;5). Applicant failed to establish any of the mitigating conditions. I conclude Applicant failed to establish any of the 
mitigating conditions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk." Regulation (app. 8) at&nbsp;132. It 
involves "the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept." <EM>Id.</EM> An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity 
at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's recent life has been difficult. A fire destroyed her home, the home's contents, and her two cars. She supports her 31-year-old daughter and three grandchildren on a meager salary 
without financial help. Nevertheless, she has had long-standing financial difficulties dating to at least 2000, well before the fire destroyed her home. Since then, she has made no real progress in 
resolving these debts. She has not contacted many of the creditors. She deliberately falsified her PTPA. Under all the circumstances, Applicant failed to establish it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant her a position of trust.</SPAN></P>
