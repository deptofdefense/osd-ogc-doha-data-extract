<P>Applicant has successfully mitigated the financial considerations security concern based on his payment of delinquent debts and his stable financial condition. 
But he deliberately falsified his response to Question 37 of a security-clearance application completed in December 2000 when he failed to disclose an unpaid 
judgment for approximately $1,500 entered against him in October 2000. His explanation or claim of mistake or misunderstanding is not credible given the 
totality of circumstances. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations, Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification of a security-clearance application), and Guideline J for 
criminal conduct (a cross-allegation to the falsification alleging a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001). Applicant answered the SOR on December 8, 2003. </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to another administrative judge to conduct a hearing on May 25, 2005, and it was reassigned to me on June 20, 2005, due to caseload 
considerations. The delay from December 8, 2003, until May 25, 2005, is explained by the case's protracted and tangled procedural history, which was covered 
in detail during the hearing and will not be repeated here (Appellate Exhibits 1 - 4; Tr. at 9 - 44). A notice of hearing was issued on July 18, 2005, scheduling 
the hearing for August 29, 2005. Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on September 
7, 2005. </P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following 
findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old man who is a native-born U.S. citizen. He is divorced from his first wife. He has a 22-year-old daughter and a 24-year-old 
stepdaughter.</P> 
<P>Starting in November 1976,  Applicant served on active duty with the U.S. Army until his retirement after 21 years of service. He was honorably discharged at 
the rank of sergeant first class (paygrade E-7). His military training and education includes completing the primary leadership development course, the basic 
noncommissioned officer course, and the advanced noncommissioned officer course. Applicant served in administrative positions in the Army and routinely 
worked with classified information for many years, including assignments on high-level staffs in the Nation's capital (Exhibits A and B). He held a security 
clearance issued by the Army since about 1980, and he was never accused of or cited for mishandling or failing to safeguard classified information. But in 
arch 1988, the Army's Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility took action to "hold in abeyance" the determination or processing of Applicant's 
security clearance (Exhibit 12). It did so based on a past-due account for $798 with a furniture company. In June 1988, after he provided proof the account was 
in good standing, the Army granted Applicant a security clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information.</P> 
<P>While serving in the Army, a state tax authority obtained a judgment for more than $1,000 against Applicant for unpaid tax for tax year 1982 (Exhibit 8). The 
judgment was taken in approximately 1985, and it was satisfied in 1986. </P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>He is now employed as the facility security officer (FSO) for a company engaged in defense contracting. He started working for the company as the facilities 
manager upon his retirement from the Army in about December 1997, and he was subsequently promoted to his current position. His annual salary is about 
$66,000, plus an annual bonus of about $5,000. In addition, his income includes $1,500 per month in military retirement pay. He owns a home with a market 
value of about $240,000, and he estimates home equity of about $80,000. His other financial assets include a 401(k) retirement account with a balance of about 
$30,000 and about $12,000 in government savings bonds.</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges in &para; 1 that Applicant was indebted to creditors for two charged-off bad debts and for two unpaid judgments. Applicant has since paid or 
otherwise resolved these debts.</P> 
<P>The charged-off bad debt for $654 in subparagraph 1.a is for a cell phone account Applicant opened on behalf of a friend who had bad credit. Contrary to their 
oral agreement, the friend did not make the necessary payments for the account. The account was charged-off in June 1998. Applicant settled the account in full 
in May 2004 (Exhibit F).</P> 
<P>The charged-off bad debt for $91 in subparagraph 1.b and the unpaid judgment for $1,558 in subparagraph 1.c are interrelated, as both concern automobile 
financing with a major car company. The account was charged-off in May 1999. The unpaid judgment (which will be discussed in detail below) was entered 
against Applicant in October 2000 (Exhibit 18). It appears the judgment was satisfied in April 2002, and the charged-off bad debt was resolved in February 
2003 (Exhibit G; Tr. at 103-107).  </P> 
<P>   The unpaid judgment for $5,619 in subparagraph 1.d is from a joint credit card account Applicant had with his then wife. The balance became overdue and 
collection action resulted in a judgment against Applicant in January 2001 (Exhibit 19). The judgment was settled for a lump-sum payment of $4,200 in August 
2004 (Exhibit H).</P> 
<P>Exhibit 18 is the documentary evidence concerning the judgment for $1,558 against Applicant. These documents establish that in about July 2000, the auto 
credit company filed a civil complaint in state court against Applicant. The complaint stated, among other things, that Applicant had bought a vehicle via an 
installment contract, which had since been assigned to plaintiff. Applicant made payments per the contract for a period but then defaulted, and the vehicle was 
never repossessed. Demand was made upon Applicant, but he did not pay. The complaint sought the balance due on the contract, plus interest and attorney's 
fees. </P> 
<P>Sometime thereafter, communications took place between Applicant and the law firm representing the plaintiff. The result was Applicant was presented with a 
"consent judgment," which he signed on August 18, 2000 (Exhibit 18 at 2 - 3). In relevant part, the consent judgment provides as follows:</P> 
<P>Defendant, [Applicant], in proper person, <STRONG>consents to a judgment</STRONG> in the amount $1,487.76, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $70.90, plus post-judgment interest at the legal rate, plus attorney's fees in the amount of $223.16 and court costs. Defendant further agrees to make payments to Plaintiff at the 
rate of $150.00 per month, commencing 08/20/00, and each month thereafter <STRONG>until the judgment is paid</STRONG>. <STRONG>Plaintiff agrees not to execute on the judgment so 
long as Defendant makes the payments as agreed </STRONG>(Exhibit 18 at 2, emphasis added).</P> 
<P>The case caption on the consent judgment indicates a trial date had been set for October 5, 2000. Applicant signed the consent judgment before a notary public. 
The attorney representing the plaintiff also signed the document. Also, the second page contained a section for the judge to sign an order that the judgment be 
entered. The judgment was entered October 3, 2000 (Exhibit 18 at 4). Subsequently, the judgment was recorded and a notice of lien was filed. Applicant made 
some of the monthly payments but then stopped, and the judgment remained unpaid until April 2002.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>In December 2000, Applicant was required to complete a security-clearance application (Exhibits 1 and 2) for his position as FSO. The application requires a 
person to provide information about various subjects, including their financial record. In response to Question 37,<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant answered no, thereby denying that 
he had an unpaid judgment in the last seven years. </P> 
<P>In August 2001, Applicant provided a written statement during the course of a background investigation (Exhibit 7). Addressing the judgment taken by the auto 
credit company, Applicant stated the debt came about when he totaled his car and his insurance policy did not cover the balance due on the loan. He also stated 
that up until the background investigation, he had no idea there was a judgment against him.</P> 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant testified about completing the security-clearance application (Tr. at 112-117). He offered the following explanation for his negative 
answer to Question 37: (1) when he completed the security-clearance application, he had no idea there was a judgment; (2) his idea of a judgment was going to 
court and being told by a judge and signing documents to acknowledge a judgment; (3) he did not receive documents showing a judgment had been entered 
against him; (4) he found out about the judgment during the background investigation in August 2001; and (5) he denied any intent to mislead the government 
or deliberately make a false statement. Concerning the consent judgment (Exhibit 18), Applicant explained he signed it without receiving legal advice. Pointing 
to the third sentence on the first page (in bold above), Applicant explained he believed that so long as he made the monthly payments, there was no judgment 
against him. </P> 
<P>Applicant presented favorable character evidence from several people who work with Applicant and know him well (Exhibits I, J, K, L, and N). These 
individuals, including the company  CEO, believe Applicant is a valuable employee who is a suitable candidate for a security clearance. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F. The two charged-off bad debts and the two judgments 
demonstrate a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The same facts and circumstances 
demonstrate financial irresponsibility.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concern. Applicant has resolved the 
four debts in the SOR by payment in full or settlement. His actions constitute a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve the indebtedness.<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Besides 
resolving the four debts in question, Applicant's overall financial situation is stable and he is not overextended. The record evidence is sufficient to conclude 
that Applicant has now established a financially responsible lifestyle. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. Omission of a past arrest or past drug use, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. I conclude Applicant deliberately provided a false 
answer in response to Question 37 of the security-clearance application. Applicant's explanation for his negative answer does not rebut or explain away the 
falsification.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's defense to the falsification allegation is that he did not understand the consequences of signing the consent judgment (Exhibit 18). His explanation 
or claim is not credible given the totality of circumstances. First, when Applicant signed the consent judgment, he had been served with the complaint and he 
then had discussions or negotiations to resolve the matter. Second, when he signed the consent judgment on August 18, 2000, a trial date was pending for 
October. Third, Applicant's reliance on the third sentence of the consent judgment is misplaced, because it views the document with blinders on as opposed to 
viewing it as a whole. The first sentence states unequivocally that Applicant "consents to a judgment." The second sentence states the monthly payments will be 
made "until the judgment is paid." Also, the second page of the document is ready for the judge to sign the order entering the judgment, which took place in 
October 2000. Fourth, this was not the first time a judgment was taken against Applicant (Exhibit 8). Fifth, his explanation is most improbable because 
Applicant--an experienced, seasoned military man and security-clearance holder--had to know the unpaid judgment might cause a problem for his security 
clearance (e.g., Exhibit 12). For all these reasons taken together, I conclude that Applicant understood the consequences of signing the consent judgment. 
Likewise, I conclude that Applicant's negative answer to Question 37 was not an honest mistake or misunderstanding, but was instead a deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification. Given these circumstances, DC 2<A HREF="02-30825.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none apply. Falsification of a security-clearance application is a serious matter, not easily 
mitigated or extenuated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. For the same reasons, the cross-allegation to the falsification under Guideline J 
for criminal conduct is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the 
evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and other appropriate factors and guidelines in 
the Directive.   </SPAN></P>
