<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 28, 2005, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on August 17, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 13, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 19, 2005.  At the hearing the 
Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
November 1, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 31 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Deck Hand, and is seeking to retain his security clearance in connection with his 
employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant denies that he was ever terminated from his employment.  On August 10, 2002, the Applicant resigned from his employment following 
allegations of misconduct.  The Applicant explained that when he was working as a security supervisor, at times, he worked from home.  He logged in extra 
hours to compensate for the hours he worked while at home.  He indicates that this situation was approved by his supervisor.  However, when the corporate 
office learned of the matter, the Applicant was told that he was going to be let go.  The Applicant resigned from the position before being terminated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted all of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1996 through 2001, the Applicant was involved in six separate alcohol related incidents.  Four of them occurred while he was on active duty in the 
arine Corps.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first of these incidents occurred on April 4, 1996.   The Applicant explained that he was a Training NCO at the time and had been drinking at a strip bar.  
He ran several miles to the front gate of the base and was picked up by the military police.  They smelled the alcohol on his breath. The Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the offense of Disorderly Conduct.  He was sentenced to Level 1 Treatment 
for alcohol, which was one week of counseling.  He also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  The Applicant learned for the first time that he had a 
problem with alcohol.  (Tr. p. 30).  He tried to  reduce his consumption of alcohol, but could not stop.  (Tr. p. 53).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 17, 1997, the Applicant received non-judicial punishment,  under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the offense of Disorderly 
Conduct.  The Applicant explained that he was still a Training NCO when he went out to a bar with friends and drank about a twelve pack.  He ended up 
urinating on the lobby couch of the barracks.  (Tr. p. 33).  This time, the Applicant was sentenced to Level 2 Treatment for alcohol.  He completed this program 
and even sought out his own counseling for his alcohol problem.  He continued to be in denial and continued to abuse alcohol.  He became dependent on 
alcohol and needed it to get through his life.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 14, 1998, the Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the offense of Disorderly 
Conduct.  At this time, the Applicant was a jungle warfare instructor, who was celebrating his class' graduation and had too much to drink.  The Applicant went 
to the wrong barracks and fell down a flight of stairs.  He was taken to the hospital and refused treatment.  The Applicant was sentenced to a reduction in rank, 
forfeiture of one half month's pay for two months, and restricted for thirty days.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant continued to consume alcohol to excess, and in February 2000, while he was a Chief Scout he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the 
Influence of Alcohol.  The Applicant explained that he had been drinking beer in the barracks and decided to drive home.  As he was driving, he peeled out into 
the street and a military police officer caught him and pulled him over.  He was administered a breathalyzer and  released to his wife.  He was sentenced to a 
reduction in rank, forfeiture of one half month's pay for two months and restricted for thirty days.  During the Applicant's treatment program, the physician 
diagnosed the Applicant as being "alcohol dependent".  (Tr. p. 50).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At this point, given the fact that his serious drinking problem had caused him to be overlooked for promotion, the Applicant decided that it would be best to get 
out of the military.  He received an honorable discharge.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  After doing so, he had difficulty finding employment and this was 
causing marital problems.  On August 1, 2000, the Applicant, who was still living on the military base because his wife was active duty Marine, had been 
drinking and went for a run.  He was picked up by the military police and they took him back to his house.  He called his wife who was out of town visiting a 
friend.  She started yelling and screaming.  The Applicant continued to drink and walked out of the house.  He got picked up again and started an verbal 
argument.  He was arrested and charged with Disorderly Conduct: Person Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs.  He pleaded nolo contendere to the amended 
charge of Fighting, Noise, and Offensive Words and was fined $139.00.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 9, 2001, the Applicant was again arrested and charged with Disorderly Conduct.  The Applicant explained that his wife confessed to him that day that 
she had been cheating on him for over two years.  The Applicant went to his brother's place of employment drunk and got into an argument with him. The 
police were called.  The Applicant was apprehended.  He pleaded nolo contendere and was fined $100.00. Following this incident, the Applicant went through 
psychiatric and marital counseling one to two times per week from October 2000 through February/March 2001.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He and his wife were divorced in August 
2002.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was consuming alcohol to excess from 1996 to at least 2002.  He usually drank in the evenings after work or on the weekends.  When he 
consumed alcohol, he became loud and obnoxious.  He stopped consuming alcohol in March 2002.  He states that he simply went "cold turkey".  (Tr. p. 52).   
After each alcohol treatment program followed by AA meetings, he returned to abusing alcohol.  At AA, he has never worked the twelve step program, nor did 
he ever have a sponsor.  He does have the twelve step book that he reads.  He has not successfully completed an alcohol rehabilitation program nor has he 
received a favorable prognosis.  (Tr. 50).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant now has a new girlfriend, a son, and is planning on getting married.  He appears to realize the seriousness of his alcohol problem as he admits 
that he is an alcoholic who cannot have even one drink for fear that he could return to his old habits.  The Applicant's support group consists of his parents, his 
brother and his fianc&eacute;.  They all consume alcohol, but the Applicant does not participate.  The Applicant keeps non-alcoholic beer in his home.  Instead of 
drinking alcohol he now finds other things to do, like spear fishing, hiking, running or weight lifting.  (Tr. p. 52).   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's performance appraisal from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, indicates that he rates "very good" in every category.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's 
Exhibit A). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of character reference submitted on the Applicant's behalf by the Boat Captain and the Marine Services Supervisor state that the Applicant is 
trustworthy and reliable.  He is considered to be a person of high moral integrity and honesty.  Both recommend the Applicant for a position of trust and would 
like to see him promoted.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits B and C).   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol treatment 
program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in personal conduct, criminal conduct, and alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J); and alcohol abuse 
(Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the 
Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under Guidelines J and G of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's personal conduct has been mitigated as it related to a job termination that he never experienced.  Accordingly, Guideline E is found for the 
Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His history of criminal and alcohol abuse is a different matter.  From 1996 to at least 2002, he abused alcohol on numerous occasions, and received non-judicial 
punishment or was arrested on six separate occasions.  While in the military, he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and was unable to stop his abusive 
drinking habit.  Since 2002, he has stopped drinking, went cold turkey, and is working hard to turn his life around.  He has divorced his wife, has a new fianc&eacute; 
and a son and is looking forward to a new lifestyle without alcohol.  He is commended for his accomplishments, including his good performance on the job.  
However, given the extensive nature of his alcohol problem and his criminal history, it is too early in his rehabilitation to ensure the Government that he will 
not return to his old ways.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has not successfully completed an inpatient or outpatient treatment program along with aftercare requirements.  He does not participate in 
Alcoholics Anonymous and he has not received a favorable prognosis from a credential medical professional.  Under Criminal Conduct, conditions that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">could 
raise a security concern are<EM> (1) Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged </EM>and<EM> (2) A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>which both apply.  None of the mitigating factors are applicable.  Under Alcohol Consumption, conditions that could raise a 
security concern are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>(1)  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . ;(4)  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the 
point of impaired judgement,</EM> and <EM>(5) Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following 
completion of an alcohol treatment program </EM>which are also applicable.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  Accordingly, Guidelines J, and G are found 
against the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the SOR.  As stated above, 
Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
