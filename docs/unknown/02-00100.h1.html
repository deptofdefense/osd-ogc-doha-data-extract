<P>Applicant was convicted in June 1977 of vehicular homicide after he struck another automobile when driving while intoxicated, causing the death of the 
passenger in the other vehicle. He was sentenced from one to five years in prison (suspended), one year probation and a $5,000.00 fine.  Employed by the same 
defense contractor since March 1978, Applicant has done nothing to violate the trust and confidence placed in him by the Government or his employer.  Despite 
his considerable success in his career as a support engineer and his complete abstinence from alcohol since November 1979, Applicant is ineligible for a 
security clearance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 because he was sentenced in 1977 to a term of imprisonment of up to five years.  Clearance is denied with a 
recommendation this case be considered for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4 and the implementation of Title 10, Section 986 of the 
United States Code), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 7,  2002, to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on criminal conduct (guideline J) due to Applicant's conviction of vehicular homicide in 1977.  That felony offense, for 
which Applicant was sentenced to one to five years imprisonment (suspended), one year probation and a $5,000.00 fine, was alleged to disqualify him from 
having a security clearance granted or renewed pursuant to Title 10, Section 986 of the United States Code (hereafter 10 U.S.C. &sect;986).<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>,  filed a response dated September 4, 2002, to the SOR in which he requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The 
case was assigned to me on November 26, 2002, and pursuant to formal notice dated December 16, 2002, a hearing was scheduled for January 7, 2003.  On 
December 18, 2002, Applicant requested a brief continuance due to legal counsel being unavailable to meet with him about his case until January 6, 2003.  The 
continuance was granted, and pursuant to amended notice dated January 21, 2003, the hearing was rescheduled for February 7, 2003.  Counsel for Applicant 
entered his appearance on January 31, 2003.</P> 
<P>At the hearing, held on February 7, 2003, the Government submitted five documents, which were admitted as exhibits.<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant's case consisted of nine 
documentary exhibits, and testimony from himself, his spouse, his department manager at work, and the associate pastor at his church.  With the receipt on 
February 27, 2003, of the transcript of the proceedings, this case is ripe for a decision.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old support engineer, who has been employed by the same defense contractor (company A) since March 1978.  He seeks to retain a secret 
security clearance, which he has held since about 1985.</P> 
<P>Following his graduation from a vocational-technical high school, Applicant enlisted in a branch of the United States military in October 1975, where he was 
assigned duties as an instrumentation mechanic.  When he was in the service, he socialized with others who used alcohol, and off-duty activities centered 
around drinking.</P> 
<P>On an occasion in April 1977, while driving under the influence of alcohol, Applicant caused a head-on collision in which the passenger in the other vehicle 
was killed.  Indicted on a charge of homicide by vehicle, a fourth degree felony, Applicant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, and he was released to the 
custody of the United States military.  Pursuant to a plea bargain, Applicant subsequently entered a nolo contendere plea, which was accepted by the court.  In 
late June 1977, he was adjudged guilty and sentenced to the state penitentiary for a term of not less than one year nor more than five years (incarceration 
suspended), and one year unsupervised probation with conditions, including payment of a $5,000.00 fine within sixty days of sentencing.  Unable to pay the 
entire fine by the due date, Applicant moved in early July 1977 to reduce the imposed fine to not more than $2,500.00, with credit for the $700.00 paid, and the 
remainder to be repaid at the rate of $150.00 per month.   In early July 1977, the court ordered Applicant could pay the remainder of his $5,000.00 fine in 
installments of not less than $150.00 per month until paid in full.</P> 
<P>From mid-June 1977 to mid-July 1977, Applicant attended a DWI school, which was required for him to retain his operator's license.  The military required 
him to submit to a psychiatric evaluation, and to attend weekly alcohol counseling sessions for one month.  In early October 1977, Applicant was 
administratively discharged from the military at the rank of E3 on ground of misconduct because of the civil court disposition.<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  While his service was 
characterized as honorable, he was deemed not eligible for reenlistment.</P> 
<P>Following his discharge from the military, Applicant got a job as a technician in the local area, at a pay rate of $4.50 per hour.  After only a couple of months, 
he lost his job due to an elimination of the position.  In December 1977, he started work as an electronic technician with a contractor at the local military base 
where he had been stationed prior to his discharge.  He left the job when it became clear he was not qualified, and moved back to his home state in January 
1978.  </P> 
<P>In late February 1978, Applicant applied for a job with company A, disclosing that he had been convicted of the felony offense of homicide by vehicle.  In early 
arch 1978, he was hired for the position of test equipment technician A at a base pay of $6.57 per hour.  While he was working at company A, Applicant was 
discharged from his probation in late June 1978, having fulfilled all obligations imposed for his felony offense.</P> 
<P>Abstinent from alcohol for a period of time following the April 1977 offense, Applicant resumed drinking after he moved back to his home state.  In 1978, 
Applicant began dating his future spouse with whom he was candid about his involvement in the vehicular homicide.  Affected by the problems his sister was 
experiencing in her marriage to an alcoholic and fearing he could not have a successful marriage if he continued to abuse alcohol,<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant in November 
1979 stopped seeing his girlfriend because he wanted to get his life together.  Applicant drew on his religious upbringing to give him the strength and desire to 
give up alcohol.  Determined not to drink, Applicant made it a point to dissociate himself from his old friends who drank.  One month later, Applicant renewed 
his relationship with his girlfriend, on the condition they start attending church.  Circa January 1980, they started going to worship services together, and they 
were married that July.</P> 
<P>In 1981, Applicant and his spouse joined a religious congregation with a strict prohibition regarding alcohol consumption and movie going.  As newlyweds, 
they taught Sunday school to four and five-year-old children in their church.  The church and his family provided Applicant the support needed to cope with 
desires to drink (which persisted for about five years after he stopped drinking) and the loneliness related to his alienation from his old friends.</P> 
<P>During the first half of the 1980s, Applicant and his spouse had three children-a daughter born in August 1981, a son born in February 1984, and a son born in 
July 1985.  With young children at home, Applicant continued to perform his work at company A with dedication while at night he pursued higher education.   
Granted a secret clearance for his duties with the defense contractor following the submission of a February 1985 Personnel Security Questionnaire on which he 
had revealed his 1977 vehicular homicide offense, Applicant progressed through the ranks at company A, attaining the highest rank in the union by the late 
1980s.  With respect to educational endeavors, he earned two associate in science degrees while working full-time during the day, an A.S. degree in electronic 
engineering in May 1986 and an A.S. degree in biomedical instrumentation technology in May 1992.</P> 
<P>As his children grew, Applicant became involved in their activities, supporting their involvements in recreational sports in the community and church activities.  
In 1990, Applicant and his family joined a new church which did not have the same restrictions against alcohol use or movie going.  Applicant did not return to 
drinking, even when faced with the illness and death of his mother.  Through his oldest son, Applicant in about 2000 became involved in the youth ministry at 
the church, including playing a base guitar at Wednesday night youth services.</P> 
<P>Completely abstinent from alcohol since November 1979, Applicant does not intend to consume alcohol in the future.  While there have been opportunities to 
consume alcohol, such as at social functions like holiday parties involving other church members, Applicant has exhibited a firm commitment to remain 
alcohol-free.<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant has informed his children about the vehicular homicide in 1977 and advised them not to drink alcohol.  Circa 1999, Applicant's older 
son sought the counsel of the church's associate pastor, who is in charge of the youth ministry, as to how he might help his father cope with the ongoing burden 
of the vehicular homicide.  Applicant has shared with the youth at church that his abuse of alcohol has led to some serious consequences in his life.</P> 
<P>In 1999, Applicant's brother informed him of an opening at a neighboring company A facility for a technical support engineer.  Selected for the salaried 
position, Applicant has demonstrated exceptional commitment, working extensive overtime when required to ensure that the tasks are completed correctly and 
on-time.  The recipient of five achievement awards between December 1999 and December 2002 (three in 2000) from his employer, Applicant has impressed 
his department manager with his "can-do attitude" and technical skill.  This department manager, who has worked in close proximity with Applicant, has not 
seen any indication that Applicant uses alcohol.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section 
E2.2.4. </P> 
<P> Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">GUIDELINE J</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">The Concern:</SPAN>  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>a.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P> 
<P>b.  A single, serious crime. . .</P> 
<P>c.  Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-marital of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year<A HREF="02-00100.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>a.  The criminal behavior was not recent</P> 
<P>b.  The crime was an isolated incident</P> 
<P>d.  The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</P> 
<P>f.  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</P> 
<P>g. Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</P> 
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</P> 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guideline J:</P> 
<P>Applicant's criminal conduct was extremely egregious, although not premeditated.  Applicant not only drove his motor vehicle when he was intoxicated, but his 
actions led to the consequences so feared by drunk driving-the death of an innocent victim.  While he did not intend the death of the passenger in the other 
vehicle, he bears criminal responsibility for this person's tragic demise.  His conviction of homicide by motor vehicle, a fourth degree felony, for which he was 
sentenced to a term in the state penitentiary of not less than one year nor more than five years, suspended, one year probation and a $5,000.00 fine, raises 
significant security concerns, notwithstanding the passage of almost 26 years since the offense.  Under the criminal conduct adjudicative guideline, 
disqualifying conditions a. (allegations or admissions of criminal conduct), b. (a single serious crime) and c. (conviction in a state court and sentenced to a term 
of imprisonment exceeding one year) must be considered in evaluating Applicant's current security suitability.</P> 
<P>Several of the Directive's mitigating conditions apply to Applicant's conduct:  a. (the criminal behavior was not recent); b. (the crime was an isolated incident); 
d. (the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur); and f. (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).  His criminal drunk driving was 
committed in April 1977, when Applicant was a 21-year-old airman stationed far away from his family, at a time when his social friendships and activities 
centered around alcohol.  He is now a 47-year-old responsible adult, with years of dedicated service to his employer, family and church, who has not taken even 
one drink of alcohol in more than 23 years. It took Applicant a couple of years after the incident to change his attitude toward alcohol, but since he decided "to 
turn his life over to God," alcohol has played no part in his lifestyle.  Alcohol is not permitted in the family home, and he has advised his children not to drink 
because of the possible adverse consequences.  While his wife has not remained alcohol-free, she has consumed only three drinks total in the last five years.  
Applicant has shared with the youth at church that his abuse of alcohol has led to some serious consequences in his life.</P> 
<P>In addition to being committed to remaining alcohol-free, Applicant continues to feel remorse for his drunk driving and causing the death of another human 
being.  He testified to thinking on occasion about the victims in the other car, and to feeling "utterly helpless" to do anything with regard to ever making it right 
with them.  (<EM>see </EM>Transcript p. 52).  The associate pastor at Applicant's church confirmed the impact the incident continues to have on Applicant and his family.  
On multiple occasions three and a half to four years ago, Applicant's oldest son expressed concern to the associate pastor, to the extent of visible upset (crying), 
about the burden he saw in his father regarding the drunk driving incident in 1977.  In discussing the peer pressure to drink in high school, this son expressed 
his knowledge that it would be a "major, major disappointment" to Applicant should he become involved with alcohol.</P> 
<P>Applicant has held a secret clearance without adverse incident since about 1985, and there is no evidence of recent or recurring questionable judgment or 
irresponsibility which would give rise to a present security risk.  Yet, criminal conduct  punished by imposition of a prison term in excess of one year is 
regarded as sufficiently serious to where it cannot be mitigated unless meritorious circumstances exist (<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> MC g.).  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the 
Department of Defense is prohibited from granting or renewing access to classified information to a defense contractor employee who has been convicted in a 
Federal or State court and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.  Although Applicant served no prison time, he could have been 
incarcerated for up to five years.  By virtue of this sentence, Applicant falls within the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, as amended, which has been implemented 
within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001 memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense titled <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting 
or Renewal of Security Clearances as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  Hence, Applicant's request 
for continued access must be denied and an adverse finding returned as to subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR.  This statutory prohibition may be waived in 
meritorious circumstances as determined by the Secretary of Defense.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
