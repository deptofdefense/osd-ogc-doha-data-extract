<P>On November 7, 2002, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application

record without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A which was admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open until April 26, 
2006. Applicant timely submitted a 10 page exhibit that was marked as AE B and admitted without objection. </SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 3, 2006.</P>

<P>Applicant admits she has not always been responsible with her finances.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She  incurred several delinquent credit cards while in college (SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.l). She intends to pay her delinquent 
debt. She and her husband married in 1996.  Her husband separated from the United States Army in 1997.  He had difficulty finding employment.  He worked jobs that did not pay well for a few years.  
He found suitable employment in 1998.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Their financial difficulties when they were first married prevented Applicant from paying on her college credit card accounts. </P> 
 
<P>Other factors prevented the repayment of their delinquent bills. Their house payment increased  due to their credit history.  In 2004/2005, Applicant was diagnosed with basal cell skin cancer.  She 
underwent two outpatient surgeries. During this period, she was unable to focus on her finances.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> During her current pregnancy, her husband has been unable to work as much overtime as he usually 
does since he takes care of the children when she is feeling ill.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In January 2005, Applicant and her husband enrolled in a repayment plan with a credit counseling agency.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Around November 2005, the agency cancelled the plan since they missed the September 
and October 2005 payments.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  She claims that during this time, she was pregnant and not feeling well and did not focus on her finances.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant earns approximately $40,000/year. Her husband earns approximately $30,000/year.  Their combined income is $70,000/year.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> On June 16, 2004, she filled out a personal financial statement. 
Based on this worksheet, she and her husband have $868 remaining each month after expenses.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  They  have established a budget which they intend to follow over the next several months in 
preparation for her maternity leave. She will be on maternity leave eight weeks and will receive only 50% of her pay while she is on maternity leave.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> They have no active credit card accounts.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> A 
few months prior to hearing, she sought financial counseling through an employee assistance program.  The counselor advised her to pay off the debt that is in the credit report first.  He advised some of 
the older debts are now legally unenforceable because of their age.<A HREF="04-11112.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations since 1996.  She and her husband have 13 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance 
of $23,717.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Most of Applicant's delinquent debts remain unpaid.  Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent</EM>).  I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>), since Applicant has numerous delinquent accounts including two automobile repossessions.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, 
divorce, or separation)</EM>) is not applicable. Although Applicant states her finances were adversely affected by her husband's inability to find suitable employment when he first separated from the Army, 
her pregnancy, and her diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, she failed to show what impact this had on her ability to manage her finances.  Her financial problems appear to be from a lack of planning and 
focus rather than from circumstances that were not within her ability to control.  Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3.</P> 
 
<P>I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>).  Although 
Applicant has attended financial counseling and was enrolled in a debt repayment program for a period of eight months, she was dis-enrolled from the program when she missed two monthly payments.  
She and her husband have recently begun to make payments towards seven of her delinquent accounts (SOR &para;&para; 1a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k).  All other delinquent accounts remain unresolved 
(SOR &para;&para; 1.d, 1.e, 1.j, 1.l and 1.m).  It is too soon to conclude she will be able to make timely payments on the debts she is paying considering her past financial history, the anticipated  50% reduction in 
her income, and her recent default on her debt repayment plan. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) cannot be applied as well. Although she has taken steps to pay off some of her 
accounts, it is too soon to determine she will be able to follow through on her intentions.  Most of these debts have been delinquent for years. I cannot conclude she made a good-faith effort to resolve 
her debts.    </P> 
 
<P>Although she has taken the initial steps towards resolving her financial situation, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant's financial situation is under control.  She has failed to mitigate the security 
concern under Guideline F.  Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the 
"whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
trustworthy implications. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guideline F based on her financial history and delayed 
action towards resolving her delinquent accounts. In fairness to Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a determination that she cannot or will not attain a state of true reform and 
rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a trustworthiness determination.  To the contrary, her mitigating evidence suggests certain attempts at paying her past due obligations. Should Applicant be 
afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of trustworthiness. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
