<P>The Applicant's past Drug Involvement is not recent, having occurred more than two years ago.  The Applicant was less than candid about his past drug abuse, 
however, when he executed his December 1991 Security Clearance Application (SCA).  Although this falsification is isolated and clearly not recent, the 
Applicant did not "voluntarily" provide the correct information.  Instead, he tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test in September of 2002.  The 
Applicant was then confronted as to his past drug abuse and executed a sworn statement thereafter.  Mitigation is not shown as to the Applicant's Personal 
Conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 4, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on January 5, 2005.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy soon thereafter, and Applicant's Reply was received on or about January 24, 2005.  The case was received by 
the undersigned for resolution on February 2, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Drug Involvement and questionable Personal 
Conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 43 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant describes his marijuana involvement in the following terms:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I first started using marijuana when I was approximately sixteen or seventeen years old [about 1977].  I would smoke one cigarette with friends at gatherings or 
social events on a biweekly to monthly basis.  My usage dropped off in college (1979 to 1983) whereby I used it only a couple of times a year.  I did not use 
marijuana at all for approximately ten years.  From approximately 1997 to Aug 02, I estimate I smoked marijuana five times (Item 5 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was granted a Secret Security Clearance in October of 1999, and used marijuana subsequent to this grant, as described above.  In September of 
2002, he tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test (Item 6).  He intends no future drug abuse (Item 3 at page 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.~1.g.  The Applicant also used and purchased LSD twice while in college (1979 to 1983), and he used and purchased cocaine once in the mid 1980s (Item 5 
at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.  In answer to question 20 on a December 1991 SCA, the Applicant failed to divulge any of his past drug abuse, as describe above (Item 4 at page 3).  After 
testing positive for marijuana in September of 2002, the Applicant was confronted and executed a sworn statement in March of 2004, wherein he disclosed his 
past drug abuse (Item 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant "attended substance abuse counseling . . . subsequent to testing positive" (Item 3 at page 4, <EM>see also</EM> Reply at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant 
and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement), which establish doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Illegal 
Drug Involvement also reflects a lack of judgment and discretion.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance 
holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private 
affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's Drug Involvement, he used marijuana, cocaine and LSD in the 1980s, and marijuana again from 1997~2002.  The first 
disqualifying condition is therefore applicable as there was "drug abuse;" i.e., "use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction."  
The second disqualifying condition is also applicable as he purchased cocaine and LSD.  However, these are countered by the first mitigating condition as the 
"drug involvement was not recent," occurring more than two years ago.  Mitigation is shown. Guideline H is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same can not be said, however, as to his Personal Conduct and related Criminal Conduct.  The Applicant was not truthful when he executed his December 
1991 SCA.  The second disqualifying condition under Personal Conduct is therefore applicable; i.e., "the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form used to . . . determine security clearance eligibility . . . ."  I can find no 
countervailing mitigating conditions here as the Applicant only "provide correct information' after being confronted with a positive random drug test.  This lack 
of candor is clearly of security significance; and as such, Guideline E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Personal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline E, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
