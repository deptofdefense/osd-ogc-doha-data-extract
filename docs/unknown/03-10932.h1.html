<P>Applicant accrued almost $8,000 in delinquent debt through a combination of financial mismanagement and a divorce. A 1997 bankruptcy discharged debts her 
ex-husband failed to pay as required by their 1996 divorce decree. Thereafter, Applicant accrued new delinquencies when an attempted reconciliation with her 
ex-husband failed and he abandoned her. Those debts have been discharged through a 2004 bankruptcy. Applicant's circumstances have changed sufficiently to 
mitigate the resulting Guideline F security concerns. She has also mitigated Guideline E concerns from her alleged falsification of a security clearance 
questionnaire (SF 86). Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.  On June 8, 2004, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant timely answered the SOR (Answer), admitted all but two<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of the allegations, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2004, and I convened a hearing October 7, 2004. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented eight exhibits (GE 1 through 8), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in her own behalf and presented nine exhibits (AE A 
through I), which were admitted without objection. I left the record open after hearing to allow Applicant time to submit an additional document I deemed 
relevant and material to the issues herein. Applicant timely submitted a nine-page exhibit admitted without objection as AE J.  DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr) on October 19, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 58 years old and employed as a security guard by a defense contractor. She is seeking her first security clearance as required by her job description. 
Applicant has been married twice - from 1979 until 1981, and from 1985 until 1996. She has one child from her first marriage. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's second marriage ended in divorce in State A, after which Applicant moved to State B. A marital settlement agreement<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> executed in May 1996 as 
part of the divorce left the house to her ex-husband in exchange for the husband assuming all marital debts, and that neither party would be obligated to pay 
support to the other. It also required the parties to pay on any accounts opened in their respective names individually, and that the Applicant's ex-husband was 
required to pay certain specified joint accounts the couple had held. Sometime in the next 18 months, Applicant became aware that her ex-husband had failed to 
pay those debts and that she was being held liable for them as he had filed for bankruptcy protection. Applicant was unable to support herself and satisfy those 
marital debts. Eventually, she also had to seek bankruptcy protection and obtained a Chapter 7 discharge in July 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over the next three years, Applicant was either self-employed as a cleaning lady, or worked multiple jobs cleaning houses and selling furniture on commission. 
In August 2000, she and a co-worker at the furniture store were fired following a dispute over who was entitled to a commission on a mattress each claimed to 
have sold. Financially, Applicant was barely making ends meet and she had to rely on credit cards more than was prudent. Four such accounts in her name have 
been charged off as business losses for failure to pay as required. (SOR &para;1.a, &para;1.b, &para;1.c, and &para;1.d). Additionally, Applicant had sporadic health care benefits and 
accrued at least three delinquent debts from unpaid medical bills. (SOR &para;1.h, &para;1.k, and &para;1.m). She also was unable to keep up with utilities and telephone bills 
(SOR &para;1.g, &para;1.i, &para;1.j, &para;1.l) and was evicted from one apartment for non-payment of rent (SOR &para;1.e).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, Applicant and her ex-husband attempted a reconciliation. He agreed to leave his job in State A and move to State B with her. She funded the move 
mainly on credit, and supported him while he looked for work. Not long after he moved in with Applicant, he left her, taking her money and some personal 
property. Applicant has been trying to pay off the debts accrued through these events ever since; however, because she had to rely on credit to effect this 
reconciliation in the first place, the net effect was to set her further back financially than she already was. In June 2000, Applicant sought help from a consumer 
credit counseling service, but the payment plan they proposed to establish with her creditors was more than she could afford each month.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant found work as a security officer in March 2001 and hired on with her current employer in August 2001. After the September 11 attacks, Applicant 
was tasked with working double shifts at every opportunity, resulting in 16 to 20-hour days for several months. Applicant was asked to submit an SF 86 for a 
clearance in December 2001. From that form, she omitted information about her debts and about her termination from the aforementioned furniture sales job. 
Applicant disclosed her 1997 bankruptcy and claims she forgot about the furniture job. She also avers she was unsure about the status of her more recent debts 
when she filled out the SF 86.The process of completing her SF 86 was disjointed and difficult owing to her long hours, and she barely reviewed the document 
as it was presented to her when she came in to pick up her paycheck.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not live extravagantly as she owns a used car and rents a small studio apartment. She has not missed or been late in paying her rent or other 
current obligations in nearly three years and is well-regarded by her employer for her honesty, reliability, and professionalism.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and Guideline F (financial considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline F is that someone who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may 
be at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties. Here, the government's concerns about Applicant's suitability to hold a 
clearance are based on her record of delinquent debts totaling approximately $8,000. The government has presented sufficient information to support these 
allegations, thereby establishing a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under Guideline F. Applicant generated unpaid debts between 1995 and 1997, which 
were discharged in bankruptcy. She again accrued delinquent debts until another discharge in bankruptcy in 2004. These facts support application of Guideline 
F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3.<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's debts in both bankruptcies were due in large measure to the actions of her ex-husband. His failure to live up to the divorce decree and 
settlement in 1997 left Applicant no choice but to seek a fresh start herself through bankruptcy. As she was trying to start a new life in another state, she was 
hampered by her own financial mismanagement; however, when her attempted reconciliation with her ex-husband failed and he absconded with her money, 
Applicant found herself in a financial hole from which she was never able to climb. None of the debts listed are for extravagant spending or unnecessary 
purchases, and Applicant realized she needed help but was unsure how to proceed. Unable to afford a credit consolidation plan payment, Applicant continued to 
live a frugal lifestyle and has at least kept pace with her current obligations. Applicant has only recently been able to earn a steady income, which, combined 
with her recent discharge in bankruptcy, and the unlikely reappearance of her ex-husband, will allow her to avoid such financial distress in the future.  
Guideline F mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.  On balance, I conclude Guideline F for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears she has deliberately omitted from her SF 86 facts about her 
financial difficulties and the fact she was fired from a job. Applicant was credible in her testimony<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> when, consistent with her previous statements to 
government investigators and in her Answer, she stated she forgot about her job termination. As to her financial responses, Applicant reasonably thought that 
she had provided enough information by disclosing the fact of her 1997 bankruptcy. Further, with that disclosure, Applicant fairly put the government on notice 
there may be some concerns about her financial background. Given that Applicant may have deliberated as to whether or not to disclose specific credit card 
debts, and elected not to, Guideline E DC 2<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. However, there was no intent to falsify her answer regarding her employment history. Additionally, as to 
her responses about financial problems, Guideline E MC 2<A HREF="03-10932.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has some application here, although the SF 86 in question must be considered as recent. 
Nonetheless, Applicant provided all of the information during the ensuing investigation and has been forthcoming on this issue throughout this process. Having 
carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and having tried to make a fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive 
Section E2.2.3, I conclude Guideline E in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on available information about Applicant's financial difficulties and her trustworthiness, this record initially raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's 
ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its 
interests. However, the record also supports a conclusion those doubts are extenuated by current circumstances and have been resolved to the government's 
satisfaction.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
