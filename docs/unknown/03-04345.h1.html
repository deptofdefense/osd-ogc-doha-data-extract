<P>Applicant's financial indebtedness has been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Her intentional falsifications on her security 
clearance application have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 19, 2004, (by notary dated February 20, 2004) and requested a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on April 15, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 23, 2004, scheduling the hearing 
for July 26, 2004.  At the hearing the Government presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant presented seventeen exhibits and she testified on her own behalf.  
The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 37 years old.  She is employed by a defense contractor as the Facility Security Manager and is seeking to obtain her security clearance in 
connection with her employment.</P> 
 
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material 
aspects of her personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits the allegations set forth under this guideline in the SOR.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a security clearance application dated September 20, 2000.  Question 39 of the application asked her if she was currently over 90 days 
delinquent on any debts?  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant was 90 days or more delinquent 
on those debts set forth below under paragraph 2.           </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that she intentionally did not reveal her delinquent financial information on her security clearance application because she did not want 
her staff to know the  information, most particularly, an individual with whom the Applicant had competed with for the job of security manager.  The Applicant 
had experienced some problems with this individual and believed that she would use the information to discredit her.  Thus, the Applicant chose not to answer 
the questions on her application truthfully.  The Applicant also knew that a Special Agent from the Defense Investigative Service would  subsequently be 
interviewing her, at which time she would disclose accurate information.  In retrospect, she realizes that she should have handled the situation differently.  The 
procedure in place at the time the applicant completed the application did not provide for complete privacy.  The company has since changed its policy and now 
the procedure provides for more privacy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a security clearance application dated September 20, 2000.  Question 40 of the application asked her if in the last seven years, she has 
been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on the form.  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Item 1).  This was a 
false answer.  The Applicant had a civil judgment entered against her that was outstanding at the time she completed the application.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 
7).          </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant failed to reveal this information on her security clearance application for the same reason stated above.  She did not want her staff to know about 
it. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">About two years after completing the security clearance application, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent from the Defense Investigative Service.  
When the agent arrived for the interview he had a copy of her security clearance application and a copy of her credit report.  (Tr. p. 32).  During the interview,  
the Applicant indicated that she intentionally failed to list her delinquent credit accounts and civil judgment because she did not want her staff to know her 
financial history.  She states that she revealed her debts and civil judgment to the special agent before he confronted her with the information.  (Tr. p. 32).  The 
Applicant subsequently shared her financial history and civil judgment with her boss and the president of the company.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a single parent whose child will be starting college soon.  In 1999, she stopped receiving child support which caused her to fall behind on her 
payments to her creditors.  In order to free up more money to pay her delinquent debts and cover her expenses, the Applicant sold her house last year.  She now 
also earns about $25,000.00 more than she did two years ago.  Her only debts at the present time are her car payment, rent, two small credit cards and a student 
loan.  The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a civil judgment entered against her in the amount of $2,297.00.  As of October 9, 2003, the debt had not been 
paid.  The Applicant paid $1,700.00 toward the debt.  The Applicant plans to continue to make monthly payments until the debt is paid in full.  (Tr. p. 34).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account that was placed into collection in the approximate amount of $48.00.  As of October 9, 2003, 
the debt had not been paid.  The Applicant has paid off the debt.  (Tr. p. 34).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">       The Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account that has been placed into collection in the approximate amount of $2,102.00.  As of 
October 9, 2003, the debt had not been paid.  The Applicant has since settled the debt for $1,039.00 and has paid it off in full.  (Tr.p. 35).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant claims that a delinquent debt listed in the SOR  in the amount of $50.00 owed to a creditor was actually a debt in her daughter's name.  As of 
October 9, 2003, the debt had not been paid.  The Applicant has paid the debt in full.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent account that charged off $616.00 with a remainder of $257.00 past due as of January 2002.  As of 
October 9, 2003, the debt had not been paid.  The Applicant has made payments toward the debt.  Her current balance is $125.00 on one of the accounts and 
$78.85 on the other.  She plans to pay them off as soon as possible. </SPAN></P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
 
<P>3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2. It was an isolated incident.</P> 
 
<P>6. The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant falsified information on her security clearance application (Guideline E)</SPAN> and 
that she was financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  
Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  With respect to her finances, the Applicant has made a good faith effort to pay off her past due creditors and resolve her financial 
indebtedness.  She now earns substantially more money than she did two years ago and she has substantially reduced her indebtedness so that she has the ability 
to pay her outstanding debts.  Furthermore, she demonstrates a sincere commitment to pay off her debts as soon as possible.  The Applicant's financial 
problems no longer remain current, (MC)1; it was isolated, (MC) 2; and the Applicant has initiated a good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve her debts (MC) 3.  Consequently, I find that these mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under Guideline F apply.  Accordingly, I find 
for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>However, it is inexcusable for the Applicant to intentionally provide false information to the Government on her security clearance application, simply because 
she does not want people to know about it.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She is the security manager of the company, and has a responsibility to set the example for other employees.  The 
Applicant knew better, and should have revealed the truth regardless of its outcome.  She knew accurate information is a vital requirement on her security 
clearance application and that the Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance 
purposes when an Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of her personal back ground, the evidence proves that the 
Applicant has not been completely honest with the Government regarding her delinquent debts and her civil judgment.  I find that the Applicant deliberately 
failed to reveal this information to the Government.  None of the mitigation factors set forth in the Directive under Guideline E apply.  This Applicant has not 
demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the 
Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.   </SPAN></P>
