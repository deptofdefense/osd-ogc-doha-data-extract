<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was convicted of alcohol-related driving offenses in 1999 and 2002. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns that exist in this case. Clearance is 
denied.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On June 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-09779.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and  Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR 
that was received by DOHA on July 18, 2005, denied all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to me on January 19, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on February 13, 2006, scheduling the hearing for March 1, 2006. The hearing 
was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted 11 documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11, and admitted into the 
record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-6, and admitted into the 
record without objection. The transcript was received on March 23, 2006.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>PROCEDURAL MATTERS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Following the close of the hearing on March 1, 2006, the record was held open for 30 days to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
documentation in support of his case. Three exhibits were timely received, marked as AE 7-9, and admitted into the record without objection. Seven items of 
correspondence from the attorneys have been marked as Appellate Exhibits (App. Ex.) I-VII, and are also included in the record.  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A cover letter (App. Ex. III) from Applicant's attorney accompanied AE 7-9 in which he requested an additional 30 days in which to submit still more 
documents in support of his case. Department Counsel did not object to the extension of time (AE VI), and the record was held open for an additional 30 days. 
Applicant submitted two more documents on May 1, 2006, that were marked as AE 10 and 11, and admitted into the record without objection (App. Ex. VII).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>AE 10 and 11 were accompanied by a cover letter (App. Ex. IV) in which Applicant's attorney requested yet another extension of time to attempt to obtain and 
submit more documents in support of Applicant's case. A conference call was held with Applicant's attorney and a substitute Department Counsel on June 6, 
2006. Applicant's attorney stated he had not yet received any additional documents for submission. Applicant's request to leave the record open past June 6, 
2006, for the submission of additional documents was thereupon denied.         <BR>

<P><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old man who has been continuously employed by a defense contractor, presently as a reliability engineer, since October 2002. He was 
previously employed by the same defense contractor as an electronics technician from June 2001 until May 2002, and was unemployed from May until October 
2002. Applicant's performance assessments and letters of recommendation indicate he has been very successful in his work performance, and is considered to 
be thorough, dependable, knowledgeable and trustworthy. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy as an aviation structural mechanic and rescue swimmer from June 1990 until June 2001. He earned three good 
conduct awards, attained the rank of petty officer second class (paygrade E-5), and was awarded an honorable discharge. He was awarded a bachelor of science 
degree in aeronautics in October 2005, and was offered admission into an MBA program in April 2006.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been married since April 2001. He has one son who is about two years old, and his wife is pregnant with their second child who is due in October 
2006.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested on November 12, 1999, and charged with (Ct.1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) and (Ct. 2) Driving While Having a 
0.08% or Higher Blood Alcohol. His Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) was 0.14%. On January 18, 2000, he pled guilty to Count 2 and Count 1 was 
dismissed. He was sentenced to serve 36 months supervised probation, five days confinement in a work release program, ordered to pay a total fine of $1,480, 
complete a drinking driver program, participate in any treatment program designated by his probation officer, and participate in the Navy's alcohol and 
substance abuse program. (GE 5)<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A violation of probation petition was filed against Applicant on March 23, 2000, due to his failure to sign up for and complete the five day work release portion 
of his sentence. On April 6, 2000, he appeared in court, his probation was modified, and he was re-referred to the work release program. He apparently 
thereafter completed the work release sentence. (GE 5 &amp; AE 8)<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On January 29, 2002, Applicant's case was calendared for arraignment on a violation of probation petition on February 11, 2002, alleging his failure to complete 
Alcohol Information School (AIS). Applicant failed to appear for the arraignment on February 11, 2002, and a warrant was issued. On February 20, 2002, the 
warrant was recalled, Applicant admitted the violation of probation, his probation was revoked, reinstated, and modified to re-refer him to AIS. He appeared in 
court on April 17, 2002, and was granted additional time to July 17, 2002 to complete AIS. Finally, Applicant appeared in court on June 3, 2002, and requested 
that AIS be deleted as a condition of his probation. The Court granted the request and modified Applicant's probation by deleting AIS and suspending his 
driver's license for six months. Because Applicant failed to complete the AIS, the state in which he was convicted will not reissue him a driver's license. (GE 5 
&amp; AE 8)<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant moved to his current state of residence in July 2002. (GE 1) He was arrested in this state on November 2, 2002, and charged with (Ct. 1) Resisting 
Officer, (Ct. 2) Expired Tag, and (Ct. 3) DUI. On January 22, 2003, he pled nolo contendere to Count 1, and guilty to Counts 2 and 3. He received a suspended 
fine and sentence on Count 1. On Count 3, he was sentenced to 12 months probation, 72 hours in jail, 30 days community service, fined $1,362, and ordered to 
turn in his license plates to probation, have an interlock device installed in his vehicle, and obtain an evaluation. The sentence for Count 2 was ordered merged 
with the sentence on Count 3. (GE 10 and GE 11) Applicant successfully completed all conditions of probation, including payment of probation fees, by 
January 5, 2004.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant obtained an alcohol evaluation on December 11, 2002. The certified addictions counselor who performed the evaluation reported that Applicant told 
her he had consumed 3-4 glasses of wine over a 4-hour period prior to his November 2002 arrest. He told her about the 1999 DUI arrest, but claimed he had 
only drank three beers before he was arrested at that time. He also told her he was not on probation. The counselor concluded Applicant did not meet the DSM 
IV-TR criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence and that no treatment was necessary. (AE 2)<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>   At the hearing of this case, Applicant admitted he had actually consumed twice as much alcohol before his 1999 arrest than he reported to the counselor. (Tr. 
p. 44) He appeared in court on the 1999 DUI case in June 2002, and the Court ordered all terms and conditions of probation previously imposed to remain in 
full force and effect. (GE 5) Having been placed on 36 months probation in January 2000, Applicant was still on probation at the time he obtained the 
evaluation. Applicant was unable to provide a reason at the hearing for his failure to disclose to the counselor that he was still on probation at that time. (Tr. p. 46)<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant testified he is active in a number of community activities. He described his alcohol consumption as consistent with what would be 
considered a social drinker, and  testified that when he does drink it is only two or three glasses of wine or two or three beers. He emphatically denied he ever 
drives a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G 
(alcohol consumption) and Guideline J (criminal conduct), with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   <BR>

<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an

<P><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>There is no evidence to support the allegation in SOR subparagraph 1.a that Applicant consumed alcohol to excess and the point of intoxication, to include 
daily, until at least January 2004. Accordingly, subparagraph 1.a is decided for Applicant. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was convicted of alcohol related driving offenses that occurred in 1999 and 2002. Guideline G, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: Alcohol-related 
incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use; 
andGuideline J, DC 2: A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses apply. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In January 2000, Applicant was convicted of driving while his BAC was 0.08% or higher. He initially failed to complete the work release portion of his 
sentence in a timely manner and a probation violation was filed. He thereafter completed the work release portion of his sentence, but he never completed the 
requirement that he attend an alcohol information school. Instead, following the filing of another probation violation, he appeared in court on two occasions, 
obtained additional time to complete the school, and eventually had that portion of his sentence vacated and his driving privileges suspended for six months. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was charged with DUI in November 2002, while still on probation and with his driving privileges suspended in another state for an alcohol-related 
offense. Applicant has repeatedly denied being intoxicated when he was arrested and claimed to have only drunk a few glasses of wine before encountering the 
arresting officers. However, he pled guilty to the DUI, and was placed on probation, and ordered to pay a substantial fine and serve 72 hours in jail as a 
consequence of that plea. His denials of being intoxicated and statements of how much alcohol he consumed before being arrested are not credible. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant obtained an alcohol evaluation in connection with the 2002 DUI. He minimized the amount of alcohol he had consumed in regards to both his 
alcohol related offenses and falsely denied he was on probation, despite having been in court in connection with the first offense a mere six months earlier. The 
false information he provided to the counselor seriously undermines the validity of her findings and the recommendation she made, apparently for use in court.<A HREF="04-09779.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> 
(12)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>It has been more than three and one-half years since Applicant's last offense. However, his conduct in committing two alcohol-related offenses in three years, 
the second while still on probation for the first; his failure to timely complete court ordered conditions of probation in connection with the first offense which 
demonstrated a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his misconduct and the importance of obeying court issued mandates; and his minimization of his 
alcohol consumption and providing other false information to a counselor during an alcohol evaluation cause continuing concern about his alcohol use despite 
his testimony to the contrary. Accordingly, I find Guideline G, Mitigating Conditions (MC) 2: The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no 
indication of a recent problem and MC 3: Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety do not apply. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>For the same reasons, I find Guideline J, MC 1: The criminal behavior was not recent; MC 2: The crime was an isolated incident; MC 4: . . . the factors leading 
to the violation are not likely to recur; and MC 6: There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation do not apply. The remaining mitigating conditions under 
Guideline G and Guideline J have no application to the facts of this case.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his alcohol consumption 
and criminal conduct. He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline G and Guideline J are decided against Applicant.          <BR>
