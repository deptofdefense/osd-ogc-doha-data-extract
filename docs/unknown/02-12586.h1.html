<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 7 October 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-12586.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior),  Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 5 November 
2003 and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 27 April 
2004.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit 
material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on 2 June 2004 and responded on 27 June 2004.  The case 
was assigned to me on 19 July 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant posed 37 objections to the FORM.  He had 11 objections to the SOR (Item 1) directed at the lack of evidence to support the allegations.  The 
objections to the SOR (1-11) are overruled.  All of the allegations in the SOR would, if true, have a bearing on the Applicant's suitability for a security 
clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had 16 objections (12-27) to Item 11--the Defense Security Service report of investigation (ROI) on Applicant.  Before discussing Applicant's 
specific objections, it is necessary to resolve the admissibility of the ROI in general.  The language of the Executive Order and DoD Directive expressly states 
that an applicant has a right to a hearing and to cross-examine witnesses.  Exec. Or. &sect; 3(3), (6); Directive &para;&para; 4.3.3, E3.1.16.  In addition, the procedural guidance 
provides the following regarding the admission of ROIs into evidence:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.20.  Official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business, other than DoD personnel background reports of investigation 
(ROI), may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses, provided that such information has been furnished by an 
investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense, or the Department or Agency head concerned to 
safeguard classified information within industry under E.). 10865 (enclosure 1).  An ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it is 
otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. 101 <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">et</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">seq.</SPAN> (reference (d)).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By using the term "witnesses," it appears the Deputy Secretary of Defense meant to limit the applicability of these provisions to hearing cases.  Nevertheless, 
the Appeal Board found as "baseless" the government's contention that an applicant waives his right to cross-examination by waiving his right to a hearing.  
DISCR OSD Case No. 93-0239 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 1994).  The Appeal Board further concluded that an ROI is not admissible against an applicant who 
represents himself in a FORM case without a knowing and intelligent waiver.<A HREF="02-12586.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  DISCR OSD Case No. 91-0716 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 1993).  As there is no record 
evidence of a knowing and intelligent waiver, I will not consider the ROI.  </SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Objections 28-35 are to Items 12-19, because they were "generated by a person of questionable character."  Items 12-19 are copies of court documents relating 
to Applicant.  His objections are overruled.  Objections 36 and 37 are to the two videotapes (Item 19) as being incomplete.  Applicant suggests the failure of the 
Government to produce a complete copy of Tape 1 impairs his ability to show that Tape 2 is not fabricated.  The Government does not contend Tape 2 is 
fabricated.  Applicant himself then claims Tape 2 is of questionable authenticity.  Applicant's objections 36 and 37 are overruled.</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Applicant submitted 14 items in response to the FORM.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 46-year-old product support engineer for a defense contractor.  He served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force from 1977-82 and has held a 
secret clearance since 1978.   He has won numerous awards from his employer for his exceptional performance at work.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant married in 1986.  Item 5 at 3.  Applicant's wife brought two daughters into the marriage and the couple had two children of their own.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4-5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The marriage was stormy.  Between March 1986 and August 2001, while he was still married, Applicant had a sexual affair with another woman for a couple of 
months.  Answer; Item 2 at 2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant installed a video camera in the bathroom used by his two stepdaughters and another video camera in the bedroom where he and his wife slept.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant had several run-ins with the law as a result of his deteriorating marriage.  He was only charged in one of the cases.  Applicant's wife obtained a 
protection order from a court in 1991 to keep Applicant away from her.  Applicant admits that, in 1991, he violated the court order by going into her home.  He 
was arrested and charged with knowingly violating the terms of the protection order and unlawful use of a weapon (a felony).  Answer.  The case was dismissed 
after the couple reconciled.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's wife apparently was awarded another protection order.  In October 1994, Applicant violated the terms of the protection order by going to his wife's 
place of employment and attempting to videotape her.  He claims he wanted to capture "incriminating information" (apparently, of her infidelities).  On 5 
December 1994, an information was filed charging Applicant with misdemeanor stalking of his wife.  The couple reconciled and the charge was dropped.  
Response at 6; Item J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On 30 November 1994, Applicant was arrested for violating a protection order by entering his wife's residence.  They reconciled and the charge was dropped.  
Item 5 at 8.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on 18 January 2000 that appears to have been electronically transmitted on 4 February 2000.  Items 
4, 5.  Question 26 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense not listed in a previous part 
of the SCA.  Applicant answered "yes" and listed an arrest on 30 November 1994 for violating a protection order, but failed to list that he was also charged with 
violating a protection order on 18 October 1994.  Item 5 at 8.  Question 27 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had illegally used any controlled 
substance, to include marijuana.  Applicant answered "no."  <EM>Id</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On 13 February 2002, Applicant refused to cooperate with a Defense Security Service agent who was seeking an interview with Applicant concerning his 
security clearance.  Item 10.  Over a year later, on 21 February 2003, Applicant was given another chance to cooperate.  Item 6.  On 28 April 2003, Applicant 
was interviewed about his SCA.  He denied abusing alcohol and insisted that he never used illegal drugs to include marijuana, never physically abused his wife 
or stepchildren, was never involved in deviant sexual behavior, and did not falsify any information in the SCA.  He refused to cooperate further.  Item 8.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant "attempted to or did secretly videotape" his former wife and stepdaughters while they were in the bathroom from 1986 to 
August 2001 (&para; 1.a) and his former wife in the bedroom, "including during intimate sexual moments" (&para; 1.b); and engaged in adultery between March 1986 and 
August 2001 (&para; 1.c).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the 
individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After reviewing the evidence, I conclude Applicant's video taping of his children and his wife were not incidents of sexual behavior.  Applicant was obsessed 
with obtaining evidence of his wife's infidelities and his stepdaughters' use of illegal drugs.  While such conduct demonstrates poor judgment, it is not sexual 
behavior as contemplated by the guideline.  Therefore, I find for Applicant on &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adultery is an incident of sexual behavior covered by the guideline because it may render an individual subject to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  DC 
E2.A4.1.2.3.  But the behavior occurred some time ago and there is no evidence such conduct recurred.  MC E2.A4.1.3.2.  Applicant admits this behavior 
occurred, so the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  MC E2.A4.1.3.4.  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In &para; 2.a, DOHA alleged Applicant violated a state criminal statute by pushing his wife at least one time during the five year time period between March 1986 
and August 2001.  There is no legible evidence to support this allegation other than a summary of his wife's statement in the ROI that was excluded.  Therefore, 
I find for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In &para; 2.b, DOHA alleged Applicant violated a state statute by slapping one or both of his stepchildren during a five year period between March 1986 and August 
2001.  The state domestic assault, third degree, statute makes it a criminal offense for a family member to knowingly cause "physical contact with such family . 
. . member knowing the other person will regard the contact as offense."  Item 25.  Family member is specifically defined as an adult.  Therefore, unless the 
stepdaughters were adults, slapping them is not a violation of the statute alleged.  Although Applicant admits slapping one or both of his stepchildren, it is not 
clear whether they were adults at the time of the slapping.  Therefore, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In &para; 2.c, DOHA alleged Applicant violated the protection order by driving his motor vehicle by his wife's home.  The state's courts have held that this is not 
sufficient to make out a case of violating a protection order.  The evidence must demonstrate a pattern of conduct.  Item 32 at 4.  Applicant denies the event and 
there is no evidence to support his wife's allegation.  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In &para; 2.f, DOHA again alleged Applicant violated the protection order by entering his wife's residence.  Applicant denies the event, and there is insufficient 
legible evidence to conclude he did so.  Under the circumstances, I must find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In &para; 2.d, DOHA alleged Applicant violated the protection order by entering his wife's residence.  Applicant denies the event, but admits it in his SCA.  In &para; 2.e, 
DOHA alleged Applicant violated the terms and conditions of a protection order by going to her place of employment and attempting to videotape her.  
Applicant admits doing so.  He claims his "intent was to film her and see sexual type marks on her neck such as hickeys, which I needed for court."  Item 9 at 2.  
Such conduct violates the state's criminal stalking statute.  In &para; 2.g, DOHA alleged that, in October 1991, Applicant knowingly violated the terms and 
conditions of a protective order by entering his wife's home.  Applicant admits that he was arrested  for violating the protection order and for unlawful use of a 
weapon.  The charges were nolle prosequi after Applicant reconciled with his wife.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's admissions of serious criminal conduct are disqualifying.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1 and E2.A10.1.2.2.  But the criminal behavior was not recent (MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1) and the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur (MC E2.A10.1.3.4).  The parties divorced in 2001 and they do not speak to each 
other.  Under the circumstances, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant used marijuana from March 1986 until December 1998.  &para; 3.a.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises 
questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The sole evidence Applicant used marijuana is a summary of an oral statement Applicant's wife made to a DSS agent that is contained in the excluded DSS 
ROI.  Applicant has consistently denied ever using illegal drugs.  I conclude the Government failed to establish by substantial evidence that Applicant used 
marijuana.  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by failing to disclose that he was charged with a criminal offense in October 1994 for 
violating an order of protection (&para; 4.a) and that he had used an illegal drug in the previous seven years (&para; 4.b).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government failed to establish Applicant deliberately falsified material facts about his use of drugs.  As the evidence was insufficient to establish he used 
marijuana, there is insufficient evidence to conclude he deliberately falsified his SCA concerning such use.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA that he been charged with a criminal offense in October 1994 
for violating an order of protection.  The failure of Applicant to list the October 1994 violation of the protection order in answer to question 26, shifted the 
burden to Applicant to explain the omissions sufficiently to negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App.
