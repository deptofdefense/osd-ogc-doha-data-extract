<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana approximately 15 times from fall 1997 to August 2004, and approximately seven times from April 2004 to August 2004 while he held a clearance. He </SPAN>falsified his September 
2000 and February 2002 clearance applications by wilfully concealing this drug history. Clearance denied.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 22 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of drug involvement 
and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He answered the SOR 19 August  2005, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 April 2006, and I heard it 13 September 2006. DOHA received the transcript 
21 September 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for the falsification allegation of subparagraph 2.b., which he denied on the grounds that he was not involved in the submission of that clearance 
application. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 28-year-old contract negotiator employed by a defense contractor since May 2000. He seeks to retain the clearance he 
has held since approximately 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant first applied for a clearance in September 2000 (G.E. 1), he deliberately concealed his marijuana abuse between January 1997 and May 2000 (question 27). He knew he had used 
marijuana while in college, but did not think his infrequent use of marijuana had to be reported--despite the clear language of the question.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early 2002, Applicant's company nominated him for a higher clearance. In February 2002, Applicant executed a second clearance application (G.E. 2)<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to begin the required background 
investigation. The application contained the same false answer to question 27 as his first application. Applicant has stated (Answer, Tr. 61-62) that he was not aware that he had been nominated for the 
higher clearance until he received notice that it was granted in July 2003. This statement is incredible because Applicant signed the application and because he was interviewed by an investigator from 
the Defense Security Service (DSS) in 2003, a required part of the investigation for higher clearance. He variously claimed that he must have signed the second application without reviewing it (Tr. 62, 
80).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not disclose his drug history to the DSS investigator during the 2003 interview. He claims that although the investigator asked him specifically about a criminal charge he had listed on his 
clearance application, he does not remember if the investigator went over the drug questions, or any of the other questions on the application (Tr. 80-82).<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 2004, Applicant's company nominated him for special access to work on contracts for a non-DoD client. In September 2004, Applicant completed a t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">hird clearance application (G.E. 3) on which he 
disclosed that he had used marijuana 15 times from January 1997 to July 2004 (question 27) and that he had used marijuana seven times between April and August 2004 while possessing a clearance 
(question 28). During this time, Applicant was on a sabbatical from his company, fulfilling a life-long dream to hike the Appalachian Trail. Although he was traveling alone, he frequently camped for 
the night with other hikers, and used marijuana offered to him while sitting around a campfire.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> He also used marijuana on one occasion later that summer while visiting friends in California.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant claims that he reported his drug use on this application because he now understood the importance of the drug questions and wanted to make a clean breast of things (Answer). He 
emphatically denied disclosing the drugs because he knew he would be subjected to a polygraph for this special access (Tr. 88), even though this claim is directly contradicted by his own recorded 
statement (A.E. C) and the testimony of a company investigator reporting statements made by Applicant to him (Tr. 34).<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>                                </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has an excellent work record (A.E. B). His character reference, a life-long friend of his family, gives him high marks for integrity (A.E. A).<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Guideline H (Drug Involvem</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ent) and G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">uideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although his use of marijuana in college might be viewed as 
experimental, his resumption of marijuana use while cleared raises additional security concerns.<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Further, he does not meet any of the mitigating conditions for drug involvement. His use was recent,<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and was neither isolated nor aberrational,<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His stated intention to refrain from drug use in the future falls short of the required demonstrated intent,<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">given his resumption of drug use after being 
cleared. I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future.  Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his drug history from the government, at a time 
when he had stopped using marijuana only a few months.<A HREF="05-03948.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> He intended to conceal this information from the government and likely intended to keep it from his employer. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He repeated the falsification 
in his February 2002 clearance. Applicant signed the application, clearly understanding that it would be forwarded. Even if I accept his claim that he signed it without re-reading it, he remains 
responsible for its accuracy. Further, he did not disclose his drug history when he was interviewed on his clearance in 2003. Not until he completed a third clearance application in September 2004 did 
he fully disclose his drug history, and only then because he knew that he would be subject to a counter-intelligence and lifestyle polygraph by the sponsoring agency. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The disclosure was neither prompt 
nor good-faith within the meaning of the mitigating conditions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before 
making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides 
some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit 
the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
