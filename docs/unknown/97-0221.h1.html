<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></P>
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated
January 2, 1992,  as amended by Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated March 19, 1997, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,
continued, denied or revoked.</P>
<P>A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>
<P>On April 30, 1997,  Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned accordingly to this
Administrative Judge on May 21, 1997,  and  on May 29, 1997,  a hearing was scheduled for June 6, 1997.<A HREF="97-0221.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>
<P>On June 2, 1997, the Government filed a Request to Take Notice of Adjudicative Facts.  The following day, on June 3, 1997, the Government filed an amended
request, asking this Administrative Judge to take notice of the following:</P>
<P>On --------------------, and --------------------, a two-round sequence of national parliamentary elections were held in [foreign country B].</P>
<P>On June 4, 1997, Applicant, through counsel, filed her objections to the Government's request of June 2, 1997, but indicated she did not oppose the Amended
Request to Take Notice of Adjudicative Facts, to the extent that those facts were only that the two-round sequence of elections were held on the dates stated.</P>
<P> At the hearing held as scheduled on June 6, 1997,  Applicant stipulated to as fact that which was the subject of the Government's amended request of June 3,
1997.     With the stipulation, the Government withdrew its pending motions to take official notice of adjudicative facts. Three Government exhibits and nine
Applicant exhibits were admitted into the record at the hearing.  In addition to Applicant's testimony, four witnesses appeared on her behalf:  her spouse, two
professional colleagues (the head of the communications division and the associate group leader of the optical communication technology group) and a close
friend.  A transcript of the hearing was received by this office on July 21, 1997.<A HREF="97-0221.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></P>
<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>
<P>After a thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, this Administrative Judge renders the following findings of fact:</P>
<P>Applicant is a 29 year old ------------------- with a doctorate  degree in ----------------------.  She has worked for her current employer (company A), a federally
funded research center,  as a staff member in the ---------------------- group since September 1995.  Applicant seeks to retain a Top Secret security clearance
which was granted to her on June 21, 1996.</P>
<P>Applicant was born abroad (in a country other than of her parents' nationality) on February 1, 1968, to citizens of foreign country B.  A citizen of country B
herself by virtue of her birth to country B nationals, Applicant was raised in various countries all around the world because of her father's status as a ----------------------- with a major international organization.  In about September 1977, Applicant resided for the first time in her life in country B where she went to high
school.   Travel was on a passport issued by foreign country B.  In September 1985, Applicant came to the United States on a student visa to pursue
undergraduate studies in electrical engineering, mathematics and humanities at a major technological university (university C).</P>
<P>During finals of her sophomore year in 1987, Applicant met her spouse, a United States citizen, who was studying at university C on a ------------------------------------ scholarship. They were married soon thereafter on ------------, 1987, and had a daughter on -----------, 1993, who is a citizen of both the United States and
foreign country B, the latter citizenship gained by virtue of her birth to Applicant.  While her spouse was on active duty in a branch of the United States military
from December 1990 to December 1995,  to include a period where he was stationed overseas from about August 1991 to August 1992, Applicant continued to
reside in the United States and pursue her graduate education at university C.</P>
<P>In early summer 1990, Applicant applied for resident alien status in the United States and that next winter was granted permanent resident alien status.  On
February 9, 1995, Applicant became a United States naturalized citizen, swearing allegiance  to the United States, and intending to exercise the rights and
privileges afforded thereby.  The decision to become a United States citizen was her own.  Shortly after becoming a naturalized citizen, Applicant went to
foreign country B's consulate with her expired foreign country B passport in hand to inform them of her change in citizenship status.  Applicant was advised
acquisition of United States citizenship would not automatically revoke her country B citizenship and that she would have to take affirmative steps to renounce,
including petitioning a country B court.<A HREF="97-0221.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not pursue the matter further at that time as she was not aware that her dual citizenship was a concern
of the Department of Defense.  She retained her country B passport and renewed it through the consulate on March 22, 1995.  After obtaining her naturalization,
Applicant got a --------------------- fellowship for outstanding students which allowed her to complete her doctorate degree.</P>
<P>By virtue of her status as a citizen of country B, Applicant was entitled to exercise voting rights in country B's local and national elections.  Applicant was
forwarded information from the consulate about the candidates and issues and provided a ballot prior to scheduled elections.  Concerned with what she viewed
as the resurgence of extremism both on the left and the right,  Applicant in --- 1995 voted in the first round of presidential elections in country B.  She elected
not to vote in the second round of those elections as those candidates with platforms which she considered "bizarre" had not garnered  sufficient vote to proceed
to the second round.  Applicant has never been affiliated with any political party in foreign country B.</P>
<P>In September 1995, Applicant earned her Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from university C.  That same month, she commenced employment full-time
with company A as a staff member in the ---------------------- group.   She apprised her employer of her dual citizenship status.  Aware that other employees of
the company held dual citizenship status, Applicant did not consider that her status as a citizen of the United States and country B would pose a problem.  From
September 18, 1995 to September 20, 1995, Applicant took a business trip to foreign country D to present a paper at an ------------- symposium on ------------------.  Applicant took with her both her foreign country B passport and her United States naturalization papers.  On entry into foreign country D on September 18,
1995, Applicant presented her foreign country B passport.  On her return into the United States on or about September 20, 1995, she presented to U.S. customs
her naturalization papers.</P>
<P>Required to obtain a security clearance for her continued employment, Applicant, in application for a Top Secret security clearance, executed a Personnel
Security Questionnaire (PSQ), a Department of Defense Form 398, on or about October 10, 1995.   Applicant disclosed thereon her dual citizenship status,
stating that she maintains her citizenship with foreign country B in order to retain voting privileges.</P>
<P>In conjunction with her background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on April 4, 1996. 
During that interview, Applicant indicated that she maintains dual citizenship status because it allows her to vote in country B national elections.  She related
she would have to petition a country B court to renounce her citizenship which would take a "great deal of time, money, and effort to accomplish this
objective."  She denied the exercise or acceptance of privileges or benefits from country B, to include receipt of honors or titles, financial compensation due to
employment or retirement, educational or medical benefits, or other social welfare benefits, with the exception of voting in national elections.  Applicant
admitted that she votes in country B elections as she is concerned with the political future of that country.  With respect to  the use of her country B passport,
Applicant explained that she had always traveled on her foreign country B passport and that she had not had the opportunity since her naturalization to apply for
a United States passport.  Applicant volunteered that she had taken a business trip to foreign country D in September 1995 but that she did not use her foreign
country B passport as a passport was not required for entry.  Applicant denied any national allegiance to country B or other foreign country, expressing her
satisfaction with her life in the United States and avowing her allegiance thereto.   She stated an intent to obtain a United States passport and to use it in
preference to her foreign country B passport.</P>
<P>After the interview, Applicant checked her foreign country B passport and discovered that she had used it to gain entry into foreign country D in September
1995.  Applicant contacted the DIS  Special Agent and a second interview was conducted on May 2, 1996.  Applicant stated she had not recalled during her
prior interview  that she had used her foreign country B passport during the business trip in September 1995.</P>
<P>On June 21, 1996, Applicant was granted a Top Secret security clearance for her duties at company A.  Knowledgeable of Applicant's dual citizenship status
and the potential security concerns posed by Applicant's extensive foreign background, Applicant's supervisors submitted her application for special access,
recommending her without hesitation.</P>
<P>Applicant obtained her United States passport on December 9, 1996.  In December 1996, she took a trip to country B to visit her mother who was residing there
for the winter.  Applicant used her United States passport on that trip and intends to use her United States passport on all future trips requiring a passport. 
Applicant is prepared to surrender her foreign country B passport to country B's consulate or to deliver it to United States authorities if requested to do so.</P>
<P>On March 25, 1997, Applicant received the SOR.  On an unspecified date in April 1997, Applicant was informed by a branch of the United States Armed Forces
that her request for special access was denied.  In April 1997, she contacted foreign country B's consulate about renouncing her country B citizenship. 
Applicant was provided a copy of country B's law on the issue.    From her reading as a non-legal person who is fluent in country B's language, and based on
information imparted by the consulate, Applicant understands the process of renunciation must commence within a year of acquiring foreign citizenship, in her
case no later than February 9, 1996.  Applicant would be willing to renounce her foreign country B citizenship if legally possible.</P>
<P>Applicant did not vote in either round of the two round sequence of foreign country B national parliamentary elections held on ------------ and ------------. 
Although Applicant remains concerned with the political future of foreign country B, she no longer intends to exercise any voting rights in foreign country B
now that she is aware that it is a concern for her defense-related duty.  Since becoming a citizen of the United States, she has voted in all the United States
national, state and local elections for which she has been eligible, to include a town referendum on ------, 1997.  Applicant is not currently affiliated with any
U.S. political party.</P>
<P>Applicant and her spouse purchased a home in the United States and are active in their community.  Applicant intends to pursue her career in the United States
and together with her spouse, raise their daughter in this country.</P>
<P>Applicant is held in high esteem at company A for her technical abilities.  Applicant was one of two persons nominated in her technical division to describe
outstanding work within the division to the entire company.  This was an honor all the more rare because she had been with the company only since September
1995.  The head of the --------------- division considers Applicant one of the key personnel on which to build the future of his division.  Applicant is regarded by
her immediate supervisor as one of the most outstanding members of the ---------------------- group.   With respect to her personal character, Applicant has
demonstrated herself to be reliable and trustworthy.  There have been no adverse incidents with respect to the handling of classified information since Applicant
was granted access to Top Secret on June 21, 1996.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be
carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful,
voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or presence of rehabilitation, the
potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2. 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or
emotionally unstable behavior. </P>
<P> Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">FOREIGN PREFERENCE</P>
<P><STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>
<P>(1) the exercise of dual citizenship</P>
<P>(2) possession and/or use of a foreign passport</P>
<P>(8) voting in foreign elections</P>
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>
<P>(4) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the
trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the
potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>
<P><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></STRONG></P>
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation,
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue her security clearance.</P>
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to
demonstrate that she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the Applicant.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of those who
testified, this Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard to criterion C.</P>
<P>A citizen of foreign country B from birth and of the United States since her U.S. naturalization on ----------, 1995, Applicant's dual citizenship would be of little
security significance if it was based solely on her birth to country B nationals.  Indeed, in order for conduct to be cognizable under criterion C, foreign
preference, the individual must have<EM> acted</EM> in such a way to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States.   Voting in the first round of
foreign country B national elections in May 1995 and use of her foreign country B passport to enter foreign country D on September 18, 1995, after she had
become a United States citizen, constitute affirmative acts in exercise of foreign citizenship which raise legitimate questions as to whether Applicant can be
counted on to place the United States interests paramount.  Inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before the
Government can seek to deny access under criterion C.  The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that those entrusted with the Nation's secrets will
make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country in cases of dual citizenship.</P>
<P>Applicant voted in the first round of country B presidential elections in May 1995 because she was concerned with the political future of foreign country B.  
With respect to the presentation of her foreign country B passport to enter foreign country D on September 18, 1995, it has not been demonstrated that
Applicant lacked the opportunity to obtain a United States passport after she was naturalized on ----------, 1995.  Notwithstanding the rigors of her academic
studies and the demands of raising her then two year old daughter, the procedure to obtain a passport is not particularly onerous.   That Applicant failed to avail
herself of the opportunity is understandable, however.   There is no evidence that she anticipated any foreign travel between February 1995 and September 1995
when she was preoccupied with her doctoral thesis.   On September 12, 1995,  Applicant requested approval for the business trip scheduled to commence on
September 18, 1995, which was signed off as approved by her group supervisor on the same day (September 12, 1995).  At best, Applicant would have had only
five days to obtain her United States passport.   The concern, therefore, is not with her failure to procure a United States passport prior to that business trip, but
rather that she presented her foreign country B passport when she also had proof of her United States citizenship with her.  Applicant submits that she used her
foreign passport solely out of necessity and in no way to indicate a preference for foreign country B.  Had Applicant been denied entry after presentation of her
naturalization papers, then her position would have merit.  There is no evidence that her use of her country B passport was other than voluntary.</P>
<P>In determining the current security significance of Applicant's voluntary exercise of privileges afforded her as a citizen of foreign country B, this Administrative
Judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to foreign preference set forth in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Of the nine listed potentially security
disqualifying conditions  (DC), Applicant's conduct falls within DCs 1. (exercise of dual citizenship), 2. (possession and/or use of a foreign passport), and 8.
(voting in foreign elections).   Applicant expects an inheritance from distant relations in foreign country B, but she was unaware of the relations until their
deaths and has not used her foreign citizenship to protect this inheritance or other financial interest.  Nor has Applicant accepted any social welfare or
educational benefits from foreign country B.  Applicant, moreover, testified credibly that her undergraduate education was paid for by her parents and her
graduate education through academic fellowships, to include a --------------------- fellowship for outstanding students once she became a United States citizen.</P>
<P>Foreign preference concerns are  mitigated under the Directive if the dual citizenship is based solely on birth (mitigating condition 1.), the indicators of  possible
foreign preference occurred before obtaining United States citizenship (MC 2.), the activity is sanctioned by the United States (MC 3.) or the individual has
expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship (MC 4.).   Although Applicant became a citizen of country B by virtue of her birth to country B foreign
nationals, the voluntary nature of her affirmative exercise of dual citizenship privileges precludes favorable consideration of MC 1.  On its face, MC 2. is not
applicable, inasmuch as Applicant used her foreign country B passport and voted in country B national elections after she became a United States naturalized
citizen.  There is no evidence that her voting or use of the passport was sanctioned by any official of the United States.</P>
<P>During an interview of April 4, 1996, Applicant denied any allegiance to any country other than the United States or that she would ever use a position of trust
to serve the interests of another Government in preference to those of the United States.  However, she also stated during the interview her intent to maintain her
dual United States/country B citizenship status and voting rights in foreign country B "because it is inordinately difficult to renounce her [foreign country B]
citizenship due to the court proceedings, and because [she would] always have an interest in [country B's] political future."  Since learning that her dual
citizenship status raises security concerns, Applicant no longer intends to exercise her dual citizenship rights, to include voting,  and would be willing to
terminate her citizenship with country B if possible.  Given the recency of her willingness to renounce her foreign country B citizenship and the fact it was
motivated primarily by the Government's concerns, it is imperative that this change in intent be confirmed by positive action.   To her credit, Applicant 
obtained a United States passport as she had promised and she used it in preference to her foreign country B passport when she visited country B in December
1996.<A HREF="97-0221.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>    After  receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted foreign country B's consulate to inquire as to how she could renounce her country B citizenship.  While
she has not commenced formal steps to relinquish that citizenship, it is because she understands from the advice of the consulate that it is no longer legally
possible.  Since September 1995, Applicant has not exercised any right or benefit of  foreign country B citizenship while making civic and professional
commitments consistent with her United States citizenship.    In addition to voting in all the United States elections for which she has been eligible, Applicant
has assumed responsibility for maintaining the local bicycle trail and teaching Sunday school.  Confirmed by the testimony of supervisory personnel, Applicant
at work has not only demonstrated outstanding technical acumen, but she has exhibited reliability, trustworthiness, and personal integrity, to include adhering to
her security responsibilities as an employee cleared to the Top Secret level.   Although Applicant indicates she is still concerned with the political future of
foreign country B, it is noted that her concern extends to other international nations as well.  Applicant's conduct in contacting the DIS Special Agent herself
after her April 4, 1996 interview to correct the record as to the use of her foreign country B passport is further evidence that her representations can be relied on
and that she takes her security responsibilities seriously.   While acts indicative of foreign preference warrant careful scrutiny, Applicant has persuaded this
Administrative Judge that she will no longer exercise any rights or privileges of citizenship other than those afforded her as a citizen of the United States. 
Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. and 1.d. are resolved in her favor. </P>
