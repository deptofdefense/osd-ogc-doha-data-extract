<P>Applicant came to the U.S. from Iran in 1977 to attend college, and has remained here,  raised a family, began a professional career, and contributed 
significantly to the national defense.  He became a U.S. citizen in 1997 and obtained a U.S. passport.  He obtained an Iranian passport in 2000, in order to care 
for his ill mother.  He surrendered the Iranian passport and renounced Iranian citizenship in 2002. Mitigation/extenuation has been demonstrated.  Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 31, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>On January 18, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to me on March 8, 2002.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 18, 2002, and the  hearing was conducted on 
April 3, 2002.  At the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2.  Applicant testified on his 
own behalf and offered nine exhibits, which were marked for identification as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A - I.  The Transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on 
April 11, 2002. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old "President/CEO" of a company doing business under contract with DoD.  His company is seeking a Secret security clearance for 
Applicant in connection with his employment.</P> 
<P>Based on the contents of the case file, including Applicant's testimony and all exhibits, I make the following findings of facts as to the current status of each 
SOR allegation. </P> 
<P>GUIDELINE C (Foreign Preference) </P> 
<P>1.a. - Applicant does not exercise dual citizenship with Iran and the United States.  He does not consider himself to be a citizen of Iran and he is willing to again 
renounce Iranian citizenship in any way requested of him (AX B, AX C).</P> 
<P>1.b. - Applicant does not possess an Iranian passport, valid or invalid, having surrendered said passport in March 2001 by sending it (through his attorney and 
with an accompanying letter) to the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. (AX E, Affidavit from counsel, dated January 18, 
2002, and AX I, Letter from Pakistani Embassy, dated March 7, 2002).</P> 
<P>1.c. - Applicant applied for an Iranian passport on January 9, 2000, after becoming a United States citizen on January 7, 1997 and obtaining a United States 
passport on February 22, 1997.  He did so for the sole purpose of being able to visit his elderly and ill parents in Iran, on short notice, in cases of a medical 
emergency (G'S 2, AX D, AX H).  He has used the Iranian passport only once, and for the purpose stated in his sworn statement.  </P> 
<P>GUIDELINE B (Foreign Influence) </P> 
<P>2.a. - Applicant's mother, father, and two siblings are citizens of Iran and currently reside in that country;</P> 
<P>2.b. - Applicant has a sibling who is a citizen of Iran and who currently resides in Germany.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">POLICIES</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"></SPAN>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P>GUIDELINE C (Foreign Preference) </P> 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United states, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>None that are currently applicable under the facts of this case.</P> 
<P>GUIDELINE B (Foreign Influence) </P> 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P>Condition that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying includes:</P> 
<P>1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns includes:</P> 
<P>1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), cohabitant(s), or associate(s) are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</P> 
<P>I have evaluated the totality of the evidence under both the specific additional guidance found in Enclosure 3 to the Directive and the general guidelines under 
Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2 to the Directive. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS </STRONG></P> 
<P>Paragraph 1 - Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</P> 
<P>1.a. - At the time the SOR was issued on December 2001, Applicant was a dual citizen of Iran by virtue of his parents' citizenship in that country and of the 
United States by naturalization.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant renounced his Iranian citizenship to DoD, and described the progress of his efforts to 
surrender his Iranian passport (AX A).  That surrender was acknowledged by the Pakistani embassy in early March 2002 (<EM>See</EM>, AX I).  </P> 
<P>1.b. - This allegation, concerning Applicant's obtaining of an Iranian passport January 2001, after becoming a naturalized United States citizen in January 1997 
raises a legitimate question as to whether this act indicated or suggested a preference for Iran over the United States.  In his personal appearance testimony, in 
his security clearance application, and Sworn Statement to an agent if the Defense Security Service (DSS), Applicant has consistently explained that he was 
concerned about the failing health of his elderly parents, who lived in Iran, and the likely need that he would have to travel there on short notice if a health crisis 
occurred.  He used the Iranian passport only once, when his mother became very ill, received extensive treatment in the United Sates, and wanted to return to 
Iran (Tr at 30, 34). </P> 
<P>He did not know that obtaining the passport would cause any concerns regarding "my loyalty to the United States, my citizenship, and foreign preference.  I'm a 
proud U.S. citizen.  I earned this privilege by working very hard and maintaining a responsible lifestyle all throughout my life.  Just for the record, I have only 
one preference, and that's to the United States."  Once learning of the Government's concerns, he promptly took steps to surrender the passport.   </P> 
<P>Applicant has used only his United States passport since obtaining it, with the sole exception, discussed above, being his desire to accompany his ill mother 
back to Iran, after medical treatment in the United States.  Considering the purpose for his obtaining the Iranian passport in 2000, I do not find that he did so out 
of any preference for Iran or even for the sake of his own convenience.  Obtaining a visa from Iran using his United States passport would likely take 25 days or 
longer (Tr at 36).  Applicant was facing a situation where using his United States passport, and having to obtain an Iranian visa, was not a viable option, 
considering his mother's condition (Tr at 35).  I do not construe his actions in this regard as showing any preference for Iran over the United States. </P> 
<P>Applicant disclaimed any other interest in visiting Iran and repeatedly stated his willingness to give up his passport, which he has, in fact, done.  He has made 
this choice knowing that if his parents become seriously or terminally ill, he will likely not be able to obtain a visa and get to Iran for close to a month.  Under 
these circumstances, I find that his present choice to surrender his Iranian  passport and renounce his Iranian citizenship demonstrates a great deal of character 
and  integrity.  His choice shows that he places his allegiance to, and identification with, the United States above that of family obligations, regardless of the 
emotional impact that will occur at some future time. </P> 
<P>I note that Applicant has been in the United States since 1977, when he arrived, with his wife, to attend college.  Upon graduation, he began teaching on the 
university level until 1988, becoming a tenured professor at 28.  In 1988, he joined a major aerospace defense contractor, as a Senior Technical Specialist.  He 
provided guidance a technology assessments on several major weapons systems.  In 1993, he started his own software engineering company and has been 
President and CEO ever since (Tr at 26 - 28).  His company's activities include a number of next-generation projects (Tr at 28).  His wife is a United States 
citizen, as are two native-born daughters, who are both in their twenties, university graduates, and working in their chosen professions. </P> 
<P>Foreign Influence </P> 
<P>The presence of family members in a foreign country, particularly a country such as Iran, is always of concern.  Since Iran is not generally friendly to the United 
States, the possibility of a risk must certainly be considered.  But, because so many Americans have ties to, and/or relatives in, foreign countries, that fact alone 
is not automatically a concern.  It becomes a concern when there some reasonable foreseeable risk that the relationship might be exploited to the detriment of 
the United States.  </P> 
<P>Under DOHA precedent, it is an applicant's burden to show that family members in a foreign country are not likely to place pressure on Applicant to the extent 
he is forced to choose between loyalty to the individual and the United States.  As in the present case, the fact that the family members are elderly and have 
never sought to use their relationship with Applicant to do something improper is a positive factor, although not dispositive.  The same is true as to the family 
members residing in Germany.  </P> 
<P>The issue that is generally most important is the risk that an applicant might submit to such pressure and act against the security interests of the United States.  
In the present case, I conclude there is no evidence suggesting that Applicant would submit to any such pressure and act against U.S. interests.  The fact that his 
wife and native-born daughters is probably the strongest tie anyone could have with our country.  Right behind that factor is Applicant's long history since 
coming to the United States in 1977.  His story comes close to the stereotypical American dream (Tr at 36 - 38).  He considers himself to be an American and 
will not act against United States interest (Tr at 51 - 53, 60, 61). </P> 
<P>Other than the presence of parents and other family members in Iran, Applicant has no substantial ties, financial or otherwise, to that country (Tr at 40).  While 
he does have an eventual interest in his parents house in Iran of $10,000.00 to $20,000.00, that figure is far outweighed by his personal net worth in the United 
States of about $10,000,000.00, plus his interest in his company.  Applicant is a product of American higher education (Tr at 41, 42), he has contributed greatly 
to our nation's security for many years, and his company has recently been asked to work on classified defense contracts, for which he needs a clearance (Tr at 
43, 44). </P> 
<P>Considering the totality of the evidence, since coming to the United Sates, and particularly since beginning the naturalization process, Applicant has never acted 
in any way as to suggest a preference for Iran over the United States.  The depth of his emotional, familial, economic and other ties to this country has been 
developed over a quarter century of hard work and dedication to this nation's interests.  </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference) </P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>In the present case, the evidence does not support the current validity of SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.   Applicant is not exercising dual U.S. - Iranian 
citizenship (Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1); he does not possess an Iranian passport (DC 2), and has not acted in such a way as to come within any of the 
other Disqualifying Conditions, DC 3 - 8.  Overall, I find for Applicant as to all Guideline C allegations  </P> 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</P> 
<P>The lack of any foreign preference makes it even less likely that Applicant would respond favorably to undue or improper pressure or persuasion.  The totality 
of the record establishes Applicant's strong ties to the United States, and his strong character as to work ethics and family relationships.  I conclude he is a man 
of integrity, who understands his obligations to his country and is unlikely to respond favorably to any attempt to subvert those obligations.  My conclusions as 
to Guideline B are reached first independently of my conclusions under Guideline C.  However, when then made in the context or the totality of the record 
under both Guidelines, the overall conclusion in favor of Applicant is made even stronger.</P> 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified  information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."  Overall, I conclude that no such doubt exists in the present case.  Applicant has demonstrated he 
possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">FORMAL FINDINGS </SPAN></P> 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)    For the Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.     For the Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">DECISION</SPAN></P> 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
