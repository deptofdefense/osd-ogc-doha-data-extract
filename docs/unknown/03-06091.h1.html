<P>Applicant, a 53-year-old security guard, failed to mitigate security concerns over his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct relating to alcohol, and personal 
conduct for failing to report employment at a company from which he was discharged for alcohol related conduct, his alcohol treatment, and all but the most 
recent criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 29, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On June 10, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations, and requested a hearing. Amended answers were filed on August 18, 2004, and September 17, 2004. 
The matter was assigned another administrative judge November 18, 2004 and re-assigned to me on February 1, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on 
February 3, 2005, and a hearing was held on February 18, 2005. Five government exhibits and two Applicant exhibits were admitted into evidence. The 
Applicant and his wife testified. The record was left open for 30 days for submission of additional material and two exhibits were received from Applicant. The 
transcript was received on February 28, 2005.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all but two of the allegations relating to alcohol consumption, two of the three relating to criminal activity, and denied the personal conduct 
allegations. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following findings of fact are made:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 53-year-old security guard employee of a defense contractor who served in the Army and Marine Corps. He has consumed alcohol to excess for 
over 20 years, received alcohol treatment for four months in 2001, but did not complete the program. He attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings beginning 
in May 2001 and still attends them occasionally. Applicant was arrested in 1979, 1989, and 1994 on alcohol related driving offenses. The first arrest resulted in 
a sentence to attend an alcohol education program and the other two resulted in convictions, suspended sentence of 30 days, fines and probation for one year. 
Both those arrest records have been expunged. He was also cited for refusing a chemical test in 1994 and his driver's license suspended for six months. He was 
arrested in 1997 and charged with domestic violence, but the record has been expunged. The most recent alcohol related driving arrest was in 1998 when he was 
convicted, fined, and ordered to enrol in an alcohol treatment program and a four month alcohol education program. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was discharged from a prior position in 2001 when, after two alcohol counseling sessions, he appeared for work intoxicated. He appealed the 
decision but it was upheld in 2002 by the Merit Systems Protection Board. He is questioning the decision with two Members of Congress. He failed to report 
his employment by the company at Question 6 and the discharge at Question 20 on his SF 86. At Question 24 relating to alcohol offenses he reported the 1998 
arrest but none of the others.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has some serious medical problems including cancer and hepatitis (Exhs. B and D). As a result, he has significantly reduced the amount of his 
drinking on medical advice but still takes an occasional drink at holiday occasions the last being at Christmas 2004. He has an intention not to drink because of 
the medical problems. His medical condition has resulted in financial problems for his family. His annual income from his employment is $62,000.00. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been married since 1976 and has one child and two step-children. His heavy consumption of alcohol began in the 1980's. When a child died in 
1991 in an auto accident he reacted by even more drinking including disappearing from home for a period. Similar conduct occurred when his mother died. 
Applicant is well regarded by his supervisor on his security team and his employer (Exhs. A and C). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 
531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited a Disqualifying Condition (DC) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol consumption under Guideline G. This relates to 
excessive alcohol consumption</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A7.1.1) and alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence. (E2.A7.1.2.2.) Possible mitigating conditions (MC) might 
include the fact that several events occurred a number of years ago and there is no current problem (E2.A7.1.3.2.), and that there have been positive changes in 
behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant last drank at Christmas 2004 even though advised by medical professionals that he should not do so. While his consumption of alcohol has been 
limited since receiving that advice, it is not sufficient to conclude that the conduct has changed and the mitigating condition is applicable. From his past conduct 
as the testimony showed, he drinks to excess when under stress from family matters.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has also alleged personal conduct under Guideline E of the Directive, relating to questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The 
Government has established that Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed relevant and material facts about his alcohol use and treatment on his SF 86,, and 
his employment by and discharge by that former employer for intoxication on the job. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that he omitted information about his employment indicates that he hoped to preclude the government from finding out about the discharge and the 
reasons for it. His contention that he had forgotten about the omitted employment is not credible in view of the fact that it resulted in a contested proceeding 
before the Merit Systems Protection Board with an adverse decision for Applicant that is still being challenged by him. I conclude that the omissions were 
deliberate and that no mitigating conditions apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is also cited. The Government has established a sufficient basis that Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.1. might be applicable 
to Applicant in that he has on five occasions been charged with criminal offenses. It could be mitigated by application of the facts in the case to certain of the 
itigating Conditions (MC). The most recent criminal behavior occurred almost seven years ago (E2.A10.1.3.1.), and there is clear evidence of rehabilitation 
(E2.A10.1.3.6.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the length of time from the last arrest is sufficient to apply the MC, there is insufficient clear evidence of rehabilitation in view of the failure to complete 
the alcohol education courses he was ordered to attend and the fact that he does continue to drink albeit in moderation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant is a family man who has many 
good characteristics and is well regarded by his superiors. His conduct at the hearing showed him to be a person who was attempting to be truthful but his 
memory loss and health problems created a certain level of mental confusion. However, the conduct alleged in this matter was not caused by factors beyond his 
control and persisted for many years during which time little action was taken to remedy the causes even though opportunities to do so were provided to him. I 
cannot conclude that the standards for ruling in his favor applying the whole person concept have been met. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
