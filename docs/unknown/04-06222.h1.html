<P>Applicant and his immediate family fled Iran in 1980 and have become U.S. citizens.  Applicant has polite telephonic contact with an uncle in Iran once a year 
and no contact with his five aunts in Iran.  Applicant's wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Her parents are citizens and residents of the Republic of Korea (ROK).  
Applicant and his wife are estranged from her father, a retired diplomat for the ROK.  Applicant has only limited and superficial contact with his mother-in-law 
because of the language barrier.  The security concern based on foreign influence is mitigated.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 22, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), based on his family ties in the Republic of 
Korea (ROK) and Iran.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 20, 2005, admitted the allegations in part and denied them in part, offered explanations, and requested a 
hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2005, and heard on October 26, 2005.  At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel's motion to 
amend paragraphs 1.d. and 1.e. of the SOR to conform to the evidence.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 16, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 38-year-old information technology consultant for a defense contractor.  He was born in Iran.  He first came to the U.S. when he was about five 
years old, accompanying his family while his father completed college in the U.S.  Applicant attended school in the U.S. and learned to speak English.  He 
returned to Iran with his family when he was about eight years old.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his immediate family, members of the Baha'i community, fled from Iran in 1980 to escape religious prosecution at the hands of the new Islamic 
government.  They traveled to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, applied for asylum, and stayed for five days with a Baha'i family in Pakistan, awaiting a decision 
on their request.  They were granted religious asylum in the U.S. in October 1980.  Applicant, his father, and his brother became naturalized U.S. citizens in 
September 1989.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married a citizen of the ROK in 1993.  His wife became a permanent resident of the U.S. shortly after their marriage, and she became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen on August 16, 2005.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Because Applicant's wife was the daughter of a diplomat, she moved frequently as a child and young adult, and she spent 
only about three or four years living in the ROK before she moved permanently to the U.S.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife have three children who are native-born 
U.S. citizens and are being raised in a traditional American life style.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  They gave their children names that would be easy to pronounce in English but also have 
significance in both Farsi and Korean languages.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant's wife has two sisters who are citizens and residents of the U.S.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, residing in the U.S., until she renounced her Iranian citizenship and surrendered her Iranian passport 
on October 1, 2005.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She traveled to Iran to visit her siblings two or three times before surrendering his Iranian passport, but she does not intend to visit Iran 
again.  She talks to Applicant's uncle by telephone four to six times a year.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's uncle, three maternal aunts, and two paternal aunts are citizens and residents of Iran.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Because Applicant's aunts and uncle are Baha'i, they are 
prohibited from holding any government positions and have limited economic opportunities.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  His uncle is a retired building contractor but none of his aunts 
has been employed outside the home.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother talks to two of his maternal aunts once or twice a year and has no contact with a third aunt.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  One of Applicant's four maternal aunts 
referred to in the SOR &para; 1.e. recently died.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father has never visited Iran since he fled in 1980.  Because he is Baha'i and was a prominent person before the revolution, he would risk detention 
and execution if he returned to Iran.  He talks to Applicant's two paternal aunts by telephone about twice a year.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contacts his uncle once a year to extend greetings on the Persian New Year.  The conversation is limited to an exchange of seasonal greetings and 
polite wishes that everyone is doing well.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  They do not discuss politics or their work because mail and electronic communications are routinely monitored.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  
Applicant has had no contact with his remaining relatives in Iran since a family reunion in Turkey in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the ROK.  Applicant's father-in-law is a retired diplomat for the ROK who previously 
served as ambassador to Chile and Belgium.  He draws a pension as a retired diplomat and is not otherwise employed.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his spouse have had no 
contact with his father-in-law since 1999, when they became estranged from him because of his objection to their marriage, his extramarital affairs while 
visiting in the U.S., and his disapproving attitude about their having daughters instead of sons.  Applicant ejected his father-in-law from their house and told 
him to never come back.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  They maintain contact with Applicant's mother-in-law, but communication is difficult for Applicant because he speaks very little 
Korean and his mother-in-law speaks very little English.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Applicant testified his relationship with his mother-in-law is pleasant, but not really a "bond of 
affection" because of their limited ability to communicate.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Islamic Republic of Iran is a constitutional, theocratic republic dominated by Shi'a Muslim clerics.  The U.S. and Iran have had very restricted economic 
ties and virtual no diplomatic relations.  Iran is a very active state sponsor of terrorism and has a dismal human rights record.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ROK is a republic with a democratically elected president and legislature and an independent judiciary.  Its government generally respects the human rights 
of its citizens.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  It is a friend and ally of the U.S.  The U.S. is obligated under the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty to help the ROK defend itself against external 
aggression.  The ROK economy is growing, and the ROK is a major trading partner with the U.S.  Relations between the U.S. and the ROK are sometimes 
complicated by the efforts of the ROK and the Democratic Republic of Korea to improve relations.  The U.S. policy is to treat the question of peace and 
security on the Korean Peninsula and a matter, first and foremost, for the Korean people to decide.<A HREF="04-06222.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to 
whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After the 
SOR was issued, Applicant's spouse was naturalized as a U.S. citizen and his mother renounced her Iranian citizenship.  Thus, all of Applicant's immediate 
family members now are citizens and residents of the U.S., and the allegations in the SOR &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.f. are rebutted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence establishes Applicant has no "close ties of affection or obligation" to his aunts and uncles in Iran.  However, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"there is a rebuttable presumption 
that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."   ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 
94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Furthermore, a disqualifying condition (DC 2) may arise if an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or 
persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's ties to the ROK and the 
possible effect they may have on Applicant's conduct are relevant considerations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. 
Bd. Nov. 21, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has rebutted the presumption of ties of affection or obligation to his father-in-law, but he has not rebutted the presumption of ties of obligation for his 
mother-in-law.  Furthermore, his wife's ties of affection and obligation to her mother raise the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress.  Thus, I 
conclude DC 1 and DC 2 are established based on Applicant's mother-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 3) may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  
Although Applicant's father-in-law served as a career diplomat for the ROK, the evidence reflects he is fully retired and no longer serving in any governmental 
capacity.  Thus, I conclude DC 3 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members, a cohabitant, or associates who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected 
with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of 
a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted to 
Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although the ROK historically has been regarded as 
friendly to the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes 
dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one in Applicant's immediate or extended family is an agent of a foreign power,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under either the statutory definition in 50 U.S.C. 1801(b) or the broader 
definition apparently adopted by the Appeal Board, nor is either of his wife's parents.  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 at *4-5 (App. Bd.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative.  Nevertheless, Applicant's evidence that his extended family in Iran and his

ROK and Iranian governments, their human rights records, and their relationships with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are all 
relevant factors in determining the likelihood that the ROK and Iran would exploit or threaten their citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the Government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  
Applicant exchanges polite greetings with his uncle once a year.  He has no contact with his aunts and his father-in-law.  He has very limited and superficial
