<P>Applicant, a 61-year-old employee of a government contractor, admitted to numerous alcohol-related criminal and work-related offenses, drinking to excess 
over an extended period of time, and omitting three convictions from his security clearance application. Omission of the three convictions was found not to be 
deliberate but the remaining allegations are sustained. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 22, 2002, the Office of  Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry </EM>as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated November 20, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on February 27, 2003. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), consisting of ten documents, was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He chose not to do so. The case was assigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on May 8, 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol incidents including driving while under the influence, and reporting for work in an 
intoxicated or impaired condition under Guideline G; questionable judgment and untrustworthiness pertaining to deliberate omission of material facts from a 
personnel security questionnaire under Guideline E; and criminal conduct under Guideline J. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following additional findings of fact are made.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant has had a long history of alcohol use and abuse with beer dating from 1964. He has had five charges of driving while intoxicated in 1985, 1988, 
1995, 1997 and 2000. He was convicted of all and sentenced to serve time in jail and/or perform community service for all convictions. He was put on 
probation in all five cases. His last offense was in 2000 the day after the submission of his SF 86. Since that time he has modified his drinking habits and now 
only drinks on weekends and only a couple of beers.</P> 
 
<P>Three blood alcohol level tests were made for the two most recent arrests and convictions that indicated.158, .168 and .172.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Two incidents occurred in 1996 at Applicant's workplace involving smell of alcohol on his breath resulting required counseling for alcohol violations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant admitted the 1997 conviction on his SF 86 dated January 21, 2000 but omitted the three oldest convictions.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant participated in alcohol abuse programs in 1998 and 2000 following arrests and convictions but continues to consume alcohol. He recognizes the 
difficulties in his life that have occurred because of his drinking habits. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Under the Directive the Government has alleged a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) all of which relate directly or stem from alcohol abuse. These 
concern alcohol related incidents away from work (E2.A7.1.2.1.), alcohol related incidents at work (E2.A7.1.2.2.), and consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment (E2.A7.1.2.5.) under Guideline G. Also alleged is falsification of his SF 86 by failing to list three of the alcohol related offenses 
(E2.A5.1.2.2) under Guideline E. The third allegation concerns criminal offenses (E2.A10.1.2.2.) under Guideline J. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of alcohol 
abuse under Guideline G  and criminal conduct under Guideline J. The Applicant has admitted the convictions and the sentences imposed by the courts. The 
facts admitted to by Applicant and found herein clearly meet the tests of the Disqualifying Conditions alleged. No mitigating concerns are applicable under the 
cited guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>The allegations under Guideline E regarding falsification of information on his SF 86 require that such falsification be deliberate. The SF 86 clearly asks "Have 
you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) relating to alcohol or drugs". The question clearly called for a full answer as to all convictions and 
Applicant withheld three of the then four prior convictions. I find that action to have been deliberate and that the Government has established the falsification.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant failed to establish that he has been rehabilitated from his alcohol abuse despite having been in two programs for alcohol abuse and stating an intent 
not to abuse alcohol in the future. His history of alcohol abuse and pattern of conduct over such a long period of time indicates a failure of rehabilitation. I 
cannot conclude that Applicant has demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P>
