<P>Following Applicant's second alcohol-related driving arrest in 2002, he successfully completed an alcohol education and treatment program and the prosecutor 
entered a nolle prosequi.  Applicant's consumption of alcohol is moderate.  Since his last offense, he does not drink away from home unless there is a 
designated driver.  There is no evidence in the record of a further problem and Applicant is committed to never drinking and driving again.  The Government's 
concern related to alcohol is mitigated.    The record also establishes that Applicant's omission of his first alcohol-related driving offense from his security 
clearance application was not deliberate.  It resulted from his confusion and the investigator confirms that Applicant voluntarily disclosed the earlier arrest to 
him.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-07878.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-07878.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  The SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and 
recommends that his case be submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>On August 29, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued 
on February 24, 2004 and the hearing was held on March 23, 2004.  During the hearing, five Government exhibits (Govt Ex), one Applicant exhibit (Ap Ex), 
and  the testimony of Applicant were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on March 31, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 40 years old.  He and his wife own and operate a small management consulting and information technology services company that contracts with 
the Government. </P> 
 
<P>On July 19, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and speeding.  He was subsequently convicted and 
fined $300.00.  (SOR &para; 1.a).   </P> 
 
<P>On June 27, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).  He had a blood alcohol level of .08%.  Applicant was required to 
attend a 12 week week alcohol education and treatment program.  He successfully completed the program on November 21, 2002.  As a result, the prosecutor 
entered a nolle prosequi on December 10, 2002.  (SOR &para; 1.b).   </P> 
 
<P>On December 6, 2002, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86).  In response to question 24,<A HREF="03-07878.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> he answered, "yes," and reported being 
charged with DWI in 2002.  Applicant failed to list his earlier arrest for DUI in 1995.  (SOR &para; 2.a).</P> 
 
<P>On February 24, 2003, Applicant provided a sworn statement to an investigator for the Defense Investigative Service (DIS).  At the beginning of the interview, 
the investigator was unaware of Applicant's earlier arrest for DUI.  Applicant voluntarily disclosed that arrest.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's consumption of alcohol is moderate.  Since his arrest for DWI, he does not consume alcohol away from home unless he has a designated driver. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish  facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is  responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption</P> 
 
<P>The concern under Guideline G is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Conditions that could  raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying under Guideline G include E2.A7.1.2.1, alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, 
child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use (Disqualifying Condition 1).  </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A7.1.3.2, the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem 
(Mitigating Condition 2).  They also include E2.A7.1.3.3, positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (Mitigating Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>The concern under Guideline E is conduct involving questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Conditions that could  raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E include E2.A5.1.2.2 (Disqualifying Condition 2).  Disqualifying Condition 2 addresses the deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment, qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities. </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A5.1.3.3 (Mitigating Condition 3).  Mitigating Condition 3 applies when the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's alcohol-related driving offenses in 1995 and 2002 raise Disqualifying Condition 1.  Following his arrest in 2002, Applicant successfully completed 
an alcohol education and treatment program.  The prosecutor determined the case appropriate for a nolle prosequi.  Applicant's consumption of alcohol is 
moderate.  Since his last offense, he does not drink away from home unless there is a designated driver.  There is no evidence in the record of a further problem 
and Applicant is committed to never drinking and driving again.  The Government's concern related to alcohol is mitigated.  I find in favor of Applicant with 
regard to SOR &para; 1. </P> 
 
<P>Guideline E: Personal Conduct    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's omission of his first alcohol-related driving offense from his security clearance application raises Disqualifying Condition 2.  Applicant denies that 
his omission was deliberate and  the record supports that conclusion.  Applicant attributed the omission to confusing the question with several that limit the 
response to a seven year period.  The DIS investigator has confirmed that he was not aware of the offense until Applicant disclosed it during his interview.  
Applicant expressed concern over whether his latest alcohol-related offense would prevent him from obtaining a clearance.  When the investigator asked him if 
he had any other offenses, applicant disclosed his earlier offense.  When the investigator asked him why he had not included it on his SF 86, Applicant referred 
to the seven year period.  Once Applicant was aware of his mistake, he asked what he needed to do to correct it.  His actions and statements  regarding the 
incident are consistent.  Moreover, the investigator confirms that Applicant voluntarily disclosed the earlier arrest to him.  Based on the record, I find 
Applicant's omission of his earlier arrest from his SF 86 was not deliberate.  Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></P>
