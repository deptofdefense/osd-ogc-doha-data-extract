  There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  The fact that the Judge found Applicant's evidence to be unpersuasive, or Applicant's ability to point to favorable evidence in the record, does not mean that the Judge ignored  Applicant's evidence.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties to decide that Applicant has not shown  those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 12, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Administrative Judge 
James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated February 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had a history of not meeting his financial 
obligations; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant was unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts; and (3) whether the Administrative 
Judge's weighing of evidence in mitigation was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had a history of not meeting his financial obligations</SPAN>.  The Judge concluded that Applicant failed to 
address  two debts (SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b), and that this was disqualifying under Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P> and 3.<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P>   The Judge found 
that Applicant failed to make any payments on the debt in SOR paragraph 1.a (approximately $8,893) since 1989, and it was charged off.  The Judge also found that 
"[a]pparently, Applicant never even inquired into the status of . . .[the debt in SOR paragraph 1.b (approximately $4,748)] . . . until the week before the hearing."  The 
Judge found that the creditor of the debt in SOR 1.b notified Applicant of the transfer of this debt to a new owner, but Applicant produced no evidence indicating that he 
attempted to contact the new owner of the debt. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant does not dispute that he did not contact the creditors involved in the account in SOR paragraph 1.b until the week before the hearing, but he argues the 
Administrative Judge ignored the absence of both debts in credit reports in 2003 and 2004.  Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge ignored his current 
"outstanding financial situation," which includes a record of timely child support payments during the past nine years, a current net remainder of $1,391.08 each month, 
total assets of over $466,000, and qualification to purchase a $160,000 house.  He also argues that the two debts are mitigated because they are "not recent";<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> one 
involves a debt more than 14 years old and the other is over seven years old. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument is not persuasive.  Generally, an applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  In considering an applicant's evidence, there is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all of 
the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  Apart from that presumption, a review of the decision below indicates that the Judge specifically 
considered mitigating evidence presented by Applicant and made favorable findings for him with respect to other debts: SOR paragraphs 1.c and 1.d, that are not in issue 
here.  A Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  The fact that the Judge 
found Applicant's evidence to be unpersuasive, or that the Applicant can point to favorable evidence, like his current financial situation, does not mean that the Judge 
ignored the Applicant's evidence.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's characterization of the two debts as "not recent," is not binding on the Judge  because it focuses only upon the initial incurring of the debts.  From a security 
standpoint, it is just as important to consider whether the debts were resolved, and if so, the manner in which they were resolved.  The two debts here continued for more 
than 14 and seven years respectively, up to the close of record evidence.  Applicant's failure to resolve these debts is relevant information which the Judge was entitled to 
consider.  The Board declines to conclude that the Judge was obliged to apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 1 in Applicant's favor.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (October 16, 2002) at pp. 3-4.  Applicant's failure to resolve these debts in the intervening years provided a rational basis for the Judge to apply 
Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0111 (November 13, 1998) at p. 4.  Moreover, we need not agree with the Judge's conclusion that 
Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations to conclude it is sustainable.  The fact that Applicant satisfied other debts in a timely manner does not negate the 
record evidence that he has delinquent debts that he has not satisfied.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,  ISCR Case No. 98-0111 (November 13, 1998) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant was unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts</SPAN>.  Applicant argues on appeal that record evidence 
shows that the two debts in SOR paragraphs 1.c and 1.d were promptly paid by Applicant upon notice that they were due, and the Judge's findings with regard to them 
support this.<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Applicant also argues that he had testified that he had contacted creditors for the debts in SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b and similarly would have paid 
them, but neither creditor had a current record of indebtedness.  He contends that current credit reports confirm that he owes no debts to the two creditors. </P> 
 
<P>Even if we assume for purposes of this appeal that the creditors may have decided to discontinue collection, this would not  preclude the Judge from considering the 
security implications of Applicant's longstanding failure to resolve the debts.  <EM>Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 3.  Considering both the evidence that 
was favorable to Applicant, and that which was unfavorable to him, the Judge's conclusion that Applicant was unable or unwilling to satisfy the debts in SOR paragraphs 
1.a and 1.b is sustainable. </P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's weighing of evidence in mitigation was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law</SPAN>. Applicant argues that the Judge erred in not 
concluding that: (a) Applicant's behavior was not recent, (b) Applicant's behavior was an isolated incident, (c) the conditions that resulted in Applicant's behavior were 
largely beyond his control, and (d) Applicant made good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  Applicant argues that the Judge erroneously 
failed to apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1, 2,<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P> 3,<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P> and 6<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P> and that the Judge's conclusions were arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's arguments regarding recency were discussed earlier.</P> 
 
<P>The Judge was not compelled to find that Applicant's conduct with respect to these two debts was "isolated" in light of their longstanding, unresolved nature and the 
amounts involved. The debts are not isolated to the points in time that Applicant stopped payment on the debts.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-14950 (May 15, 2003) at 
pp. 4-5. </P> 
 
<P>We are not persuaded that the Judge erred because he did not find "that the sole reason for his past financial problems" is due to Applicant's ex-spouse.  The debt in 
SOR paragraph 1.a had been outstanding since 1989, a point in time long before Applicant's self-described period of financial difficulty (1995-2002).   Moreover, even if 
Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances outside his control, the Judge reasonably could consider whether Applicant acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with such difficulties. <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21243 (September 30, 2003) at p. 4.  The Judge's Decision articulates concern about 
Applicant's failure to demonstrate actions between the time that the debts were incurred (1989 and 1997 respectively) and the time of the hearing that were consistent 
with a good-faith effort to resolve these debts.  Accordingly, the Judge's conclusion that Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 3 did not apply is sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 should have been applied to his case.  He bases his argument in part on a claim that the two debts are 
resolved.  In addition to his testimony that he contacted the creditors involved in the debts in SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b to inquire into the status of the debts, Applicant 
contends that the Judge erred because the two "credit reports" introduced into evidence (Exhibits C and J) demonstrate the absence of the two debts.<A HREF="02-18093.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Applicant says 
that the Judge "overlooked the obvious conclusion that there was no debtor to pay in each situation" and the "Applicant could not be expected to make payments to an 
unknown debtor and to an unknown account number."  He argues that he has demonstrated that he is willing and able to pay either debt if the creditor makes a current 
demand.</P> 
 
<P>"Good-faith," as used in Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, 
and adherence to duty or obligation.  Applicant did not resolve these debts over the years and now seeks to avoid their effect by their removal from his credit history.  
<EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0111 (November 13, 1998) at p. 4.  The Judge's conclusion that Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 did not apply to either 
debt is sustainable in view of Applicant's longstanding failure to even address them.  An applicant must do more than merely show that he/she relied on a legally available 
option to claim the benefit of Mitigating Condition 6.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 4.  The fact that an unsatisfied debt is dropped from a 
credit report, perhaps due to legal or regulatory requirements, does not preclude the Judge from considering its security significance.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-14950 (May 15, 2003) at p. 5. </P> 
 
<P>In weighing all the evidence, we do not have to agree with the Judge's ultimate security clearance determination to sustain it against a challenge that it was arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.  A Judge's decision to deny a security clearance is sustainable despite claims of an excellent current financial status when an applicant has 
two substantial long overdue outstanding debts that he has not resolved.  <EM>Cf</EM>.  ISCR Case No. 01-19278 (April 22, 2003) at p. 5.</P>
