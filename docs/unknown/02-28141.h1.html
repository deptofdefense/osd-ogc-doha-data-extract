<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was charged and convicted of four misdemeanor incidents over a three-year period while in college (two of them alcohol-related).  Applicant 
attributes his encounters to immaturity and a bad attitude towards the police.  With his excellent record of academic and professional achievement, he has 
changed his lifestyle and altered his attitude towards law enforcement for the better.  No longer does he associate with the kind of friends and acquaintances that 
attracted him to trouble with the authorities as an adolescent.  Applicant mitigates the security risks associated with his prior judgment lapses by demonstrated 
reliability and trustworthiness in his work and personal life.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 15, 2003 and requested a hearing.  I was  assigned  this case on June 4, 2003, and scheduled it for hearing on June 27, 
2003.  A hearing was convened on June 27, 2003, as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on three 
witnesses (including himself) and seven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on July 8, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 24-year-old security specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested on four occasions between February 1997 and April 2000: on a disorderly conduct charge in 
February 1997, to which he pleaded guilty and was fined $200.00; on an open container charge in November 1998, to which he pleaded  <EM>nolo contendre </EM>to 
possession by a minor and was fined $250.00; on a charge of prohibited sales of alcohol in January 2000, to which he pleaded guilty to a reduced violation and 
was fined $300.00 ($200.00 suspended), and on a charge of disorderly conduct/simple assault in April 2000, to which he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct 
and was fined $150.00 (with the simple assault charge <EM>nolle prossed</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations. He claimed he paid each of the fines assessed and has not been involved in any further offenses 
or infractions since his last arrest in April 2000.  Applicant attributes alcohol, immaturity, and an unfavorable attitude towards police authority as the principal 
sources of his errant behavior.  He claimed to have enjoyed considerable academic success in college in spite of the four incidents in his record.   Since 
relocating to his current state to accept his current professional employment, he claims to have  matured and changed his attitude for the better.  He claimed the 
last of the four incidents represented a wake-up call for him.  Since this last incident, he assured he has corrected the causes of his judgment lapses with 
authorities and now acknowledges the police as his friends. He claimed to have demonstrated reliability and trustworthiness in his academic and professional 
pursuits and is no longer a risk to repeat his earlier mistakes.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>While in college and a minor, Applicant was involved in four separate incidents in which he was arrested, charged, and convicted of  misdemeanor offenses.  In 
each case, he was fined only.  He attributes his actions to immaturity and a negative attitude against police authority in general.  His experiences with campus 
police in his first few years of college weakened his faith in the law and accounted for much of his drinking and disregard of behavioral restraints in the small 
college community where he resided.  </P> 
 
<P>Two of Applicant's covered incidents were alcohol-related.  In the first of these incidents (in November 1998), he had been drinking with several other 
similarly under age minors when he was arrested for possession of alcohol.  Applicant's other alcohol-related incident occurred in January 2000.  Preceding his 
arrest he had bought beer for three others under age.  His last campus incident  occurred in April 2000.  This arrest was non-alcohol-related and occurred after 
he had pushed a police officer and made an expletive remark about a police officer's giving a ticket to another.</P> 
 
<P>Since his last arrest incident in April 2000, Applicant has avoided any kind of criminal behavior.  Now that he has completed his college schooling and 
accepted a position with his current employer in another state, he no longer associates with anyone under 21 years of age.  He does not engage in alcohol-related 
behavior that could place him at risk to encounters with law enforcement authorities.  His attitude towards police has changed for the better: He now considers 
them to be on his side.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has received excellent employment evaluations from his current employer and is highly regarded by his current supervisor and assistant security 
officer.  Both characterize Applicant as very reliable and trustworthy.  Neither has detected any judgment lapses in the one and one-half years he has been 
employed by the company (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 47-54).  Applicant's excellent academic record includes not only solid grades, but credits for design recognition by a 
regional media association,  a governor's grant and certificates of appreciation for his work in a college-oriented peer tutoring program (<EM>see</EM> exs.  C through G).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of materiality, however, does 
not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of misdemeanor criminal arrests and convictions (four in all) over a three-year period while he was in college.  He attributes his run of 
offenses to alcohol, adolescent immaturity and a bad attitude towards the police while a college student.</P> 
 
<P>To be sure, Applicant's acknowledged judgment lapses did not affect his academic pursuits.  Just the same, these lapses were concentrated over a three-year 
period and together reflect poor judgment and immaturity.  Taken together, these incidents have security significance and are covered by two of the 
disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC 1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct) and DC 2 (a single 
serious or multiple lesser offenses).</P> 
 
<P>Since relocating and accepting employment with his current employer, Applicant has inspired considerable confidence among his supervisors and colleagues.  
He attributes much of his success to a significant attitude change about his perceptions of the police.  Now he sees the police as his friend and looks to find 
ways of rendering assistance to his community.  No longer does he associate with the kind of acquaintances he got into trouble with back in college.  His 
professional and personal development are marked by over three and one-half years of trouble-free behavior in his adopted state.  Since his last offense in April 
2000, he has not violated any public laws or ordinances (not even a traffic law).  Applicant may invoke several mitigating conditions (MC) covered by the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: MC 1 (behavior not recent) and MC 6 (there is clear evidence of rehabilitation).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) 
of the Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>
