<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From age 15 in 1995, to age 21 in 2001, Applicant used and sold illegal drugs. During this period of time, he was convicted of five felony offenses, three of 
them drug related. He was also convicted of two misdemeanor offenses, one drug related, and was cited for another drug offense. The information in the record

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security 
concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, 
based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him access to classified information.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On July 1, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">requested a clearance decision 
based on the written record without a hearing.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 5, 2005. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on August 18, 2005, and he 
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on August 31, 2005. Applicant provided his one page response on September 9, 2005, and included three documents for 
consideration. He did not object to anything contained in the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 11, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant  admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a - 1.k, and 2.b - 2.d. He failed to respond to subparagraphs 2.a, and 3.a. I considered these 
allegations denied. His </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 26 years old and single. He attended high school from 1994 to 2000, but apparently obtained his high school diploma through an adult education 
program in March 2000.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He described himself as a troubled teenager mixed up with drugs and criminal activity and attributed his past behavior to his lack of 
adequate direction and supervision in life. According to his SF 86, he has lived at his current address since 1984. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His security concerns stemmed from his long history of criminal behavior, largely related to his illegal drug abuse. Applicant began to use marijuana when he 
was 15 years old.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> From age 15 to 16, he use marijuana at social events with his high school friends. From Age 17 to 18, he used marijuana on a daily basis, 
smoking one or two marijuana cigarettes a day. From age 19 to 21, Applicant used marijuana on what he described as a sporadic-frequent basis, sometimes 
daily, sometimes once a month. He enjoyed using marijuana because it made him feel mellow. Applicant purchased his own marijuana and spent between $100 
and $200 a month. In 2001, he stopped using marijuana. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant started using cocaine when he was 17 years old. By age 18, he would binge on cocaine, consuming it for two days in a row. He purchased and sold 
cocaine to support his own habit, spending approximately $200 a month for personal use. He stopped using cocaine because it was too expensive, and he did 
not like the fact that it made him too hyper. Applicant stated he has not used cocaine since 2001. He also used several amphetamines during high school and 
until 2001, when he stopped using illegal drugs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's documented criminal behavior began in April 1997, at age 17. He and some of his friends were arrested and charged with two felonies for breaking 
into cars to steal their contents. He pled guilty to receiving stolen property, a felony, and possession of burglary tools, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced, in 
part, to pay a $1,000 fine and to serve 30 days in jail. In March 1998, a car in which he was a passenger was stopped by police officers. Applicant was searched 
and found to be in possession of 10 grams of marijuana. He pled guilty to possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. In May 1998, after binging on cocaine at a 
party, he was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants. He pled guilty to charges of driving under the influence of cocaine, a misdemeanor, and 
possession of cocaine, a felony. He was sentenced, in part, to pay a $1,500 fine and to serve seven days in jail under a sentence diversion program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1998, Applicant was searched during a traffic stop and found to be in possession of 18 grams of methamphetamine. He pled guilty to transportation 
of controlled substances, a felony. The charge of possession of controlled substances was dismissed. He was sentenced to 120 days confinement and a $500 
fine. In April 1999, Applicant was snorting cocaine with friends. When police officers arrived at the location, he elected to run away. He pled to possession of a 
controlled substance, a felony, and resisting arrest, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and a $740 fine. In June 2001, Applicant pled guilty to 
driving under the influence of alcohol. He was sentenced to pay a $1,900 fine and served two days in jail. Finally, in August 2001, he was cited for possession 
of marijuana while driving a car. He paid a $305 fine. There is no evidence Applicant has been involved in any further criminal misconduct since August 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2001, Applicant was hired as a maintenance trade helper for a technology company doing business with the Department of Defense. He averred he 
has received outstanding performance reviews for the last four years and has been promoted twice. He manages a small department and is the administrator of a 
computer network. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the FORM, Applicant claimed that as a result of his mistakes and experiences, he realized he had no future and decided to change his lifestyle. 
He averred he has taken responsibility for his actions and participated in several rehabilitative programs that taught him positive ways to look at life. To support 
his assertions, he included certificates of completion for three different programs in August 2000. Applicant claimed he has learned from his mistakes and will 
not repeat his criminal behavior. He averred that through his participation in diversion programs, he has matured and developed strong discipline, ethics, and 
morals. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed, in large part, his drug abuse and criminal behavior on the security clearance application he submitted in March 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. The 
administrative judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the case. The guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the 
granting or denial of access to classified information. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a 
disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial 
common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Having considered the record evidence as a 
whole, I conclude Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), are the applicable relevant 
adjudicative guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> for an applicant to be eligible to either 
receive or continue to have access to classified information. The government has the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the 
government's case. Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to 
ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified 
information in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), a history or pattern of criminal conduct is a security concern because it may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules 
and regulations and may show the applicant to be lacking in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government established its case under Guideline J 
by showing that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">from age 15 in 1995, to age 21 in 2001, Applicant used, transported, and sold illegal drugs. During this period of time, he was convicted of five 
felony offenses, three of them drug related. Additionally, he was convicted of two misdemeanor offenses, one drug related, and was cited for another drug 
offense. <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber16"></A>I conclude Guideline J Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct</EM>,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple 
lesser offenses</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant engaged in criminal misconduct between the ages of 15 and 21. As such, his behavior could be attributed, to a certain extent, to youthful exuberance 
or stupidity. Further, there is no evidence he has been involved in any further drug related incidents or criminal misconduct since 2001. After considering all of 
the Guideline J Mitigating Conditions (MC), I find that only MC 1: <EM>The criminal behavior is not recent</EM>,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies. It has been five years since the Applicant 
committed a criminal offense. As such, his actions are not recent. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Nevertheless, under the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant's criminal behavior is not isolated, and that he has not demonstrated clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation. Applicant's record evidence is not sufficient for him to overcome the security concerns raised by his behavior. Applicant's available 
information indicates he has not used drugs or been involved in any drug related incident or any other criminal misconduct since 2001. However, considering 
his long history and frequency of substance abuse, the nature and seriousness of his criminal misconduct, and the lack of information to establish he had been 
fully rehabilitated and is participating in aftercare programs to prevent recurrence, I find his favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline J 
security concerns. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information. Such conduct may also be criminal and indicative of a disregard for rules and regulations in place to protect national interests.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government 
established its case under Guideline H by showing that Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine, with varying frequency, including daily, 
from 1995 until around November 2001. The government further established that Applicant purchased and sold drugs.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Guideline H DC 1: <EM>Any drug abuse</EM>,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Illegal drug possession, . . . purchase, sale, or distribution</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>,</EM><A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber12"></A>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I considered all the Guideline H Mitigating Conditions and, for the same reasons outlined above under the discussion of the Guideline J Mitigating Conditions, 
I conclude MC 1: <EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">MC 3: <EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> apply. I also find, however, 
that Applicant's behavior was not isolated as it spanned a period of six years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">For the same reasons outlined above under the discussion of the Guideline J Mitigating Conditions (incorporated herein), I conclude Applicant's illegal 
involvement with drugs raises questions about his ability and willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. The record 
evidence suggests Applicant had a serious drug abuse problem. He abused a variety of drugs for six years, and his abuse was frequent. Most of the time he was 
using drugs on a daily basis. Applicant showed no regard for the consequences of his actions even though he was convicted, fined and incarcerated on numerous 
occasions. Although his drug related behavior is not recent and he has stated he intends never to use drugs again, under the totality of the circumstances, 
Applicant's available information failed to show he has been rehabilitated and/or that he has taken steps to prevent future recurrence. I find Guideline H against 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate question - whether a person's past conduct 
instills confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Guideline E allegation is based on the same identical facts that give rise to the security concerns alleged under Guideline J. The government established its 
case under Guideline E by showing the facts already discussed under Guidelines J, above, incorporated herein. Personal Conduct DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Personal conduct . . . 
that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, 
professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">; <A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>and DC 5:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> <EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I considered all the Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude that only MC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>,<A HREF="04-04107.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> There is no evidence Applicant has been involved in any drug related incidents or criminal 
misconduct since 2001, and he disclosed his past criminal behavior and drug abuse in his SF 86. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Notwithstanding, for the same reasons outlined above under the discussion of the Guideline J and Guideline H Mitigating Conditions, I conclude Applicant is 
not able to mitigate the security concerns. His disclosure of his drug related misconduct and criminal behavior, absent evidence of rehabilitation and efforts to 
prevent recurrence of his past criminal and drug related behavior, is not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline E concerns. A single incident of illegal drug use 
calls into question a person's judgment. Repeated drug involvement after several convictions and subsequent confinement demonstrates an absolute lack of 
judgment and complete disregard for the law, rules and regulations. Under the totality of the circumstances of this case, the passage of time alone is not 
sufficient to demonstrate Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interest as his own. He 
failed to meet his burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's concerns. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard requires any 
reasonable doubt about this Applicant's suitability for a security clearance to be resolved in favor of protecting national security. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative 
guidelines. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's statement, his misconduct, the whole person 
concept, and the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, I find Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P>
