<P>Between 2001 and 2003, Applicant incurred approximately $10,000 in delinquent debt, after purchasing a car for transportation to and from work. Because she lacked sufficient income to pay both 
the car payment and her delinquent credit debt, she chose to forego her credit card payments and pay her car payments. Since August 2003, she has not incurred additional delinquent debt, and 
timely pays her monthly expenses, including her mortgage and car payment. Under South Carolina law, her creditors no longer have a legal claim against her for delinquent debts. Applicant did not

DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F

<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Guideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and 
discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> An administrative

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P>It has not done so under Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case. Since 2002, Applicant has been unable to meet all her financial obligations. Currently, she has numerous delinquent debts related to credit 
cards or store accounts, totaling around $10,000.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Applicant's ten delinquent debts remain outstanding and are more than three years old. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>) in full. She gets some credit for not incurring additional delinquent debt in the last three years. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) does not 
apply because she incurred ten different delinquent debts incurred over a period of two and one-half years.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) does not apply. Applicant became delinquent on these debts after purchasing a car, which she needed for transportation to work. The car payment amounts to one-third of her net monthly income, leaving no extra money for payment of her debt.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply. 
Applicant does not indicate that she has sought financial counseling or credit counseling regarding her debts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is not applicable. Applicant states that she intends to pay these debts one at a 
time when she concludes her car payment at the end of 2007. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to 
repay debt. None of the debts alleged in SOR are being repaid. Other then her promise to pay in the future, she has not taken steps to resolve these debts. Except for the two accounts with zero 
balances, her debts remain, and are unlikely to be resolved in the near future because she earns only enough money to pay her current living expenses.<A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>She does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, for the application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to all of her unpaid SOR debts. <EM>See</EM> 
S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530.<A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs. The 
cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential 
defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their 
rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch</EM>, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Elimination of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended her potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer "financially 
overextended," but it does not negate her past conduct in accumulating debt which she could not pay.</P> 
 
<P>P<STRONG>ersonal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the central question does a person's past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for 
a security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from her SF 85P when she answered "no" to Question 20 because she had ten delinquent credit card or store 
accounts. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her answer to this question. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an 
omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to 
determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.<A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> For Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions 
(PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . </EM>. .) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 (<EM>Deliberately 
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . .</EM>) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant's omission, concealment or 
falsification in her answers was deliberate.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant explained that she did not list her delinquent debts in response to Question 20 on the public trust application because she thought the question related to personal loans and 
her credit card debt never crossed her mind. From this statement, I infer that she did not understand her credit card debt to be a loan. When confronted with her credit report by the investigator, 
Applicant readily acknowledged these debts in an affidavit, dated February 5, 2005. She does not deny these debts and admits without reservation that she has not made any effort to resolve them. 
She truthfully stated that she paid one debt. In weighing all her statements regarding her indebtedness, I find that she did not deliberately falsify her answer to Question 20. She has been forthright in 
her presentation of all other information related to her finances, and has not tried to gloss over or conceal her financial problems. Her statement that she misinterpreted the information requested in 
Question 20 is credible. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) does not apply. Guideline E is decided in favor of Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns. She is 30 years old, and sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct. She chose to pay for her 
purchases with credit, then decided not to pay her credit bills. Her inability to repay her debts started when she needed to purchase a car. Given her limited income, she chose between transportation 
for work and paying her creditors. Her substantial monthly car payment, which is always timely, absorbed her excess income, and prevented her from paying some of her other credit obligations. 
She timely pays her monthly bills, including her mortgage. She has not incurred any unpaid credit debt since August of 2003. The absence of new delinquent debt over the last three years and 
compliance with a budget are additional factors which evidence rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and self-discipline in regards to her finances. The potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress is low because she is current on her recent debts, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and has been steadily employed for the last six years. She is very conscious of her income limitations and has shown an 
ability to live within her monthly income. Her attitude about her finances and her adherence to her budget support a determination of trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In sum, in the absence of unanticipated and unusual expenses, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has stated an intent to resolve her delinquent debts, even though she is not 
legally required to pay them because of the South Carolina 3-year statute of limitations. Although eight of the ten SOR debts remain unpaid, there is little likelihood that this unpaid debt would 
present a security clearance problem as she is not legally liable for these debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the 
whole person,<SUP><A HREF="06-02535.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I conclude she has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations, and the personal conduct concerns are not substantiated.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other 
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing 
that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a 
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
