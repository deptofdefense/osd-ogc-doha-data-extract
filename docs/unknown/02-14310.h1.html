<P>Applicant's 20+ year history of alcohol abuse and dependence was not mitigated where it was punctuated by six alcohol-related arrests and seven alcohol-related treatments, several of which resulted in a diagnosis of alcohol dependence by a credentialed medical professional. Applicant's evidence fails to establish 
that she has either stopped consuming or stopped abusing alcohol, or otherwise has a recovery system in place to prevent recurrence of her alcohol abuse. 
Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On 29 September 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)(Item 1) to Applicant, stating that DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-14310.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
On 29 October 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Item 2) and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 10 November 2003; the record in this case closed 26 December 2003, the day the response was due 
at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 15 January 2004 to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the alcohol allegations of paragraph 1 of the SOR, but denied the allegations of paragraphs 2 (Personal Conduct) and 3 (Financial 
Considerations). Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain her access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an extensive history of alcohol abuse punctuated by six alcohol-related arrests and seven periods of alcohol counseling and/or treatment. She is an 
alcohol dependent who apparently continues to drink--contrary to medical advice--and is in denial of her alcohol problem.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has six arrests for operating her vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol: August 1979 (reduced to reckless driving), June 1981 
(DUI), February 1985 (DWI), November 1987 (DUI, failed blood alcohol test after being in an accident, while five months pregnant), April 1999 (DUI), and 
June 2000 (DUI, .22 BAC, nearly three times the state's legal limit of .08).<A HREF="02-14310.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She also has seven alcohol-related contacts with medical professionals: June 1975 
(hospital consult to discuss her use of alcohol), December 1987 (attended one session, diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a credentialed medical professional, 
refused to participate further), February 1995 (2-day hospital admission for alcohol detoxification, diagnosed as alcohol-dependent by a credentialed medical 
professional), May-October 1998 (treatment for alcohol dependence and depression; advised to abstain from alcohol), August-October 2000 (counseling for 
alcohol dependence), December 2000-January 2001 (3-day hospital admission for alcohol detoxification, diagnosed as alcohol dependent by credentialed 
medical professional), which also revealed a February 1999 hospital detoxification.<A HREF="02-14310.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> After her last hospital admission, she was recommended for an extensive 
outpatient program, but did not participate because her husband does not think she has an alcohol problem and much of their relationship involves alcohol; 
drinking is also a major focus of their leisure activities with friends. She was not willing to admit she was an alcoholic, and admitted being afraid that her 
relationship with her husband would change drastically if she stopped drinking altogether.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answer acknowledges that she has a tendency to self-medicate with alcohol during times of stress and makes uncorroborated claims that she 
weathered 9/11 and her mother's death in September 2002 without becoming stressed. Her answer contains no indication whether she is still drinking and if so, 
how much. Nor does it contain any information on what support system she has in place to avoid falling back into alcohol abuse. She had previously expressed 
an unwillingness to participate in AA because she objected to its religious focus, but she does not appear to have followed up on her stated intent to pursue 
rational recovery programs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 20 December 2000, Applicant falsified her clearance application when she disclosed her April 1999 and June 2000 alcohol arrests (and her August-October 
2000 alcohol counseling) but did not disclose her other four alcohol-related arrests or the other three (February 1995, May-October 1998, and February 1999) 
alcohol-related treatments within the last seven years. Her explanation--that she did not think she had to report offenses that had previously been 
reported--would be more believable if she had not used that explanation in April 1990 when she was confronted about potential falsifications during that 
subject interview for disclosing only her November 1987 alcohol arrest on her clearance application. Her explanation also does not explain why she omitted her 
other alcohol-related treatments during the past seven years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A May 2003 Credit Bureau Report (CBR)(Item 15) reflects a public record lien for approximately $7,600.00 filed in March 1993. Applicant denies having any 
liens, and the CBR contains no indication of who filed the lien or why.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record contains no evidence of Applicant's work performance or reputation.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's history of alcohol abuse is well established by her multiple alcohol-related arrests and 
multiple treatments for alcohol dependence. Applicant neither claims nor demonstrates any abstinence from alcohol consumption, much less abuse, nor does 
she proffer any explanation upon which I might reasonably conclude that she no longer abuses alcohol or is at risk to abuse alcohol. Instead, everything about 
this record corroborates my impression that she remains in denial of her alcohol dependence and remains at substantial risk to abuse alcohol again. Essentially, 
she meets all of the disqualifying factors under the guideline, while satisfying none of the mitigating factors. I find Guideline G. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant clearly understated her adverse alcohol history, both regarding her arrests and her 
treatment within the last seven years. I found her explanation for the omission unconvincing, particularly where she had reason to know  from prior experience 
that she was required to disclose all alcohol-related arrests and all alcohol treatment and counseling within the last seven years. I resolve Guideline E against the 
Applicant.<A HREF="02-14310.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has not established its case under Guideline F. The Government's only evidence of this debt is an otherwise clean, 5-page credit bureau report 
(CBR) that contains an otherwise unidentifiable publicly-filed lien for approximately $7600.00 filed in March 1993. The SOR allegation alleges as much as the 
Government knows about this alleged debt, which Applicant denies. While a CBR may be some evidence of debt, where--as here--Applicant denies the debt, 
the CBR does not identify any information that could clue the Government, the Applicant, or me who or why the lien was filed, there is no indication on the 
CBR of any other debt that might have ripened into this lien, Applicant was never confronted with this alleged debt, nor did the Government otherwise 
investigate, I cannot conclude that the Government has made its case under Guideline F. Further, even if I concluded that the Government had established its 
case, I would not conclude that this one debt was sizeable enough, considered against Applicant's otherwise clean CBR, to present any pressure point to 
Applicant, particularly where there is no evidence of any effort by the creditor to pursue the lien. I resolve Guideline F for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996 and Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Her June 2001 sworn statement demonstrates the high level of her alcoholic denial. She states her June 2000 DUI arrest was because she had "three drinks" at 
dinner, knew she should not be driving back to the hotel, and was sitting in her car in the parking lot with the radio on trying to decide what to do when the 
police found her and charged her with DUI. The contemporaneous police record reflects Applicant was found blacked out in her car (which was running) and 
blew a .22 BAC. According to research used by MADD and other anti-drunk driving organizations, a 137-pound woman who had three drinks in two hours 
would test at approximately .07 BAC. <EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, www.madd.org/stats/0,1056,1183,00.html. Applicant, at 110 pounds, blew a .22. It is simply not credible for her to 
maintain she only had three drinks. In a similar fashion, she describes her New Year's 2000 hospital admission as something that helped her "get through a 
stressful situation," completely ignoring the fact that she was there for detoxification from a two-week binge of alcohol. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>During her intake interview, Applicant described her alcohol consumption: "'I'm a binge drinker' 3 or 4 times a year. 'Went on a cruise and drank every day 
from December 16<SUP>th</SUP> -23rd.' Came home and was sober on 24<SUP>th</SUP> . Started drinking on Christmas and has been drinking every day since." Elsewhere in the 
medical records she reported drinking eight to ten drinks per day while on the cruise, a liter of alcohol per day since Christmas, and a 6-pack of beer the 
morning of her admission. She had consumed a fifth of benedictine and brandy, a fifth-and-a-half of vodka and 24 beers in the last five days. She acknowledged 
trying to stop alcohol on her own in 1995, with her longest period of abstinence being six months. She also disclosed an additional hospital detoxification in 
February 1999. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>I resolve the allegation in subparagraph 2.b. for Applicant because the security significance of a former employer who would not hire Applicant because of 
her alcohol problem not really an issue of personal conduct but an issue of the adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in the workplace more properly 
considered as part of the evaluation of the Alcohol Consumption guidelines.
