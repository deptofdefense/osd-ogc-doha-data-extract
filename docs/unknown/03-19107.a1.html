<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 25, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 28, 2005, after the hearing,  
Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="03-19107.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in making certain factual findings and whether the Administrative 
Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline B had not been mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in finding that: (1) Applicant works for a defense contractor as a "chemical engineer," (2) Applicant's 
parents were "victims of the Cultural Revolution," (3) "there is a U.S. Consulate [in Applicant's home province]," and (4) Applicant "admits she would travel 
to the PRC to visit [her parents] if not for security concerns."  Applicant's arguments have mixed merit. There is insufficient record evidence to support the first 
three findings.  However, the fourth finding is reasonably supported by record evidence.<A HREF="03-19107.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the evidence she provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Administrative Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that 
she had rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations.  The Board does not find this 
argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) Applicant has parents and a brother who are citizens of the People's Republic of China (China), 
residing in China, (2) Applicant had traveled to China in 2002 and 2004, and (3) Applicant maintains monthly telephone contact with her parents.  Given those 
findings, the Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with those immediate family members raised security concerns under Guideline B and that 
Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 6 applied.  The Judge's conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  Where there are admitted 
or proven facts and circumstances that raise security concerns, "[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
clearance decision."  Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that her contacts with her parents are casual and infrequent, and that the Administrative Judge gave insufficient weight to evidence that 
Applicant has excellent character, professional and employment references.  She also argues that there are many Hearing Office decisions in which an applicant 
in ostensibly similar circumstances was granted a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members are not casual.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  
Given the record in this case, Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to 
conclude that Applicant had not met her burden of establishing that her contacts with her parents were casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Likewise, Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met 
her burden of establishing that her relatives were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force her to choose between loyalty to 
those relatives and the United States.  Mere disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error without a showing 
that the Judge's weighing of the evidence was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless he or she specifically states otherwise. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g. </EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). Applicant's ability to cite to record evidence that she contends should have been given greater weight is not 
sufficient to overcome that rebuttable presumption in this case.<A HREF="03-19107.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Merely because a Judge does not give greater weight to record evidence cited by the appealing 
party, it does not follow that the Judge simply ignored that evidence.  Moreover, to the extent Applicant's argument can be construed as challenging the Judge's 
weighing of the record evidence, it fails to establish that the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Lastly, the decision in another DOHA Hearing Office case does not demonstrate error by the Judge in this case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not 
legally binding precedent on that Judge's colleagues in other cases and such cases are not legally binding precedent on the Board.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-22606 
at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has demonstrated error with respect to three of the Judge's findings, but the errors are not sufficient individually or cumulatively to warrant reversal.  
The Judge's sustainable findings are sufficient to support his ultimate adverse security clearance determination and it is unlikely that remand would produce a 
different result.</SPAN></P>
