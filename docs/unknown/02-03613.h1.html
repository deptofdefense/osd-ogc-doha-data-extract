<P>Applicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in at least five alcohol-related arrests and convictions for Driving Under the Influence (DUI), the first taking place in 
1987 and the last in1999. Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is not sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history.  Additionally, in a signed, sworn 
1999 Security Clearance Application (SCA) supplied to the Government, Applicant knowingly failed to disclose that he received five DUI convictions; he only 
identified one. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 12, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated December  31, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On June 10, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM)<A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant filed a response to the FORM on July 9, 2003. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-11). Applicant's three page response to the FORM has been identified and entered into the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his response to the SOR, Applicant 
admits all of the allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 41 years old and married. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his 
employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has consumed alcohol since approximately 1983, when he was 21 years of age. He continues to drink alcohol.  At one point in time, Applicant would 
consume as many as 36, 12 ounce, bottles of beer in one night. During this period he was also experiencing blackouts, up to a frequency of two times a month  
(Exhibit  6).  Applicant's drinking has resulted in five alcohol related incidents where he was arrested and found or pled guilty for DUI. They occurred  in 1987, 
1989, 1996, 1998, and 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The first two DUI arrests in 1987 and 1989 resulted in Article 15s of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (Exhibits 9 and 10).  The 1987 DUI also 
resulted in Applicant's  reduction in grade to E-4.  Because of the third arrest in 1996, Applicant paid a fine and received 12 months probation (Exhibit 8). In 
1998, Applicant was arrested a fourth time for DUI. He paid a fine and was sentenced to alcohol and drug screening (Exhibit 7). Finally, in 1999, Applicant was 
arrested for a fifth time for DUI. For this arrest , he paid a fine and was sentenced to confinement in jail (Exhibit 6). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government.  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 
completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October 6, 1999. Question #24 asks, "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of 
any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?" Applicant answered  "Yes" to question #24,  and he listed one DUI arrest in 1999. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As discussed above, Applicant 
was also arrested for DUIs in 1998, 1996, 1989, and 1987. Applicant clearly failed to give a complete and truthful answer to this extremely significant question 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 5).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Also, while it was not alleged in the SOR, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">when Applicant met with a Defense Security Service agent and created a signed, sworn statement in 2001, he talked 
about the arrests in 1999 and 1996, but failed to furnish information regarding the other three DUI convictions. He stated, "The only time I have had a problems 
as a result of my drinking is the two arrests listed above."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 6).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his response to the FORM, Applicant discussed the fact that he is raising his two children, he is remarried and that he is changing his life for the better 
(Exhibit A). There was no mention about his abstaining from consuming alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">of human experience, or apply equally in every case. Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use; (E2.A7.1.2.1.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">5. Habitual of binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment; (E2.A7.1.2.5.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.)<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance 
action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;(E2.A5.1.2.2.).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G) and that he 
furnished untruthful information to the Government (Guideline E). Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation 
or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG> Applicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">five alcohol related incidents from 1987 to 1999.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is 
reasonable to conclude Applicant was drinking heavily and these incidents are indicative of his high level of alcohol consumption. As discussed above, at one 
pont Applicant consumed as many as 32 beers at one sitting and suffered up to two blackouts a month.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As to the amount of alcohol he now consumes, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> acknowledged in a statement to the Defense Security Service, signed under oath in 2001, that he was 
an alcoholic, and he</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">stated, "I have not drank any alcoholic beverage, to include beer, since my arrest in March 1999." (Exhibit 6).  However, in interrogatory 
responses that he completed in October 2002, he indicated that he currently consumes about 6 glasses of beer a month and that he intends to continue drinking 
alcohol in the future (Exhibit 11).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, five DUIs, which is 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1. He was involved in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment  up until at least 1999, which 
is DC 5 .</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis, despite stating on May 2001 that he has not been consuming alcohol, nor will he in the 
future. Applicant has a demonstrated history of drinking to excess, and he presents no credible evidence to support a conclusion he has reformed his habit. No 
itigating Condition (MC) applies. Paragraph 1 is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal  conduct)</STRONG>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such 
an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the 
judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested and convicted of five DUIs</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. Applicant failed to list four of the five arrests 
and convictions on his SCA. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence proves that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the 
Government in response to a question on the SCA that he executed in May 1999. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC 2 applies because of the false information that Applicant provided in his SCA.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> has not 
mitigated this allegation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Also, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's failure to furnish information to the Defense Security Service agent regarding three of the five DUI convictions 
must be considered adversely against Applicant. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and  2 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
