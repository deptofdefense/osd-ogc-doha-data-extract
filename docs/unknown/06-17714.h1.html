</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On August 16, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="06-17714.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department 
of Defense Directive,<A HREF="06-17714.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing September 9, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On October 5, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  The parties agreed to a hearing 
date of November 17, 2006, and a hearing was convened on that date to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  At 
the hearing, the Government called no witnesses, submitted one exhibit for identification and admission into evidence, and offered five official U.S. documents containing facts for administrative 
notice.  Applicant did not object to the admission of the Government's exhibit, which was identified as Ex. 1,  and it was admitted into evidence.  Applicant did not object to the factual documents, 
identified as Government Documents for Administrative Notice I through V, and they were admitted to the record.  Applicant appeared as a witness on his own behalf and called four additional 
witnesses.  He introduced four exhibits, which were identified as Applicant's Ex. A through D, and admitted to the record without objection.  On December 5, 2006,  DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the conclusion of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform with the evidence adduced at the hearing.  <EM>See</EM> &para; E3.1.17 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive.  Without 
objection, allegation 1.c. of the SOR was amended to read: "At last report, your fiancee's father had a Soviet passport indicating Georgian nationality, and he may be in Georgia."  Without 
objection, allegation 1.d. of the SOR was amended to read as follows: " Your fiancee's brother is a citizen and resident of Russia."  Without objection, allegation 1.f. of the SOR was amended to 
read: "You traveled to Russia in at least 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct charged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four allegations and denied two allegations. 
After the SOR was amended to conform to the evidence adduced at the hearing, Applicant admitted all six allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a senior military analyst employed by a defense contractor. He and his colleagues consider his work to be important to the national security.  (Tr. 156; Exs. B, C, and D.)  He earns 
approximately $140,000 a year.  He was born in 1962 and is currently 44 years old.  From 1979 to 1990, Applicant worked, attended college part-time, and cared for his ailing parents.  In 1990, he 
received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.  (Ex. 1, Tr. 36, 137.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1989, while still a university student, Applicant met a young girl, who was approximately 16 years old.  The girl, a citizen and resident of Russia, was studying briefly in the U.S. as an exchange 
student.  Applicant and the young girl became friends but did not have a romantic relationship.  She returned to Russia.  (Tr. 111, 125.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1991, Applicant accepted a diplomatic position with the U.S. government, and he continued to hold that position until January 1994.  In 1992, he became engaged to a U.S. citizen, who was 
killed in an automobile accident that same year.  Throughout his three years of employment in the diplomatic position, Applicant corresponded every few months with the Russian girl and reported 
his correspondence to his superiors.  In January 1994, Applicant made an arrangement to meet the Russian girl, who was living in a city on the northern side of the Caucasus Mountains next to 
Georgia.  He resigned his diplomatic job, traveled to Russia and met the girl, who was now approximately 21 years old, in Moscow.  He visited the girl for a about a week, and the couple became 
engaged.  Applicant came back to the U.S. and planned to obtain a fiancee visa so she could come to the U.S.  He returned to Moscow in February 1995, where he spent about two days with his 
fiancee.  During that visit, a child was conceived.  Applicant's daughter was born in November 1995.  Applicant's daughter is a citizen and resident of Russia.  (Tr. 92, 108, 112, 120-122, 125-128.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant traveled to visit his fiancee and their daughter in her home city in the Caucasus.  The fiancee's father, an ethnic Georgian, knew Applicant was a U.S. citizen and did not approve 
of Applicant's relationship with his daughter. The father told his daughter and Applicant he wanted nothing to do with them, and he threatened to kill them if they ever came to his house again. 
Applicant returned to the U.S. after visiting his fiancee and child for about a week.  Not long afterwards, the fiancee's family split up, and the fiancee's parents divorced.  The father, who held a 
Soviet passport indicating Georgian nationality, left the family and perhaps went to Georgia.  Applicant's fiancee and child, along with her mother and grandmother, went to join her brother, who 
had found work as an import-export factor at a port city in the Russian Far East.<A HREF="06-17714.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant visited his fiancee and child in the Russian Far East in 1998 and 1999.  He has not seen them since the 
1999 visit.  (Tr. 96, 122-123, 130.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant gave about $10,000 to his fiancee so she could  establish a cosmetic business and be self-supporting.  In 2004, the fiancee obtained a Russian Federation passport that would enable her to 
come to the U.S.  For the past two years, Applicant has unsuccessfully sought a Russian visa so he can travel to Russia, marry his fiancee, and bring her and their daughter to the U.S.  (Tr. 89, 97, 
100, 131.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's fiancee and daughter live in a city in the Russian Far East about 150 miles from the city where the fiancee's brother lives.  The fiancee's grandmother, a citizen of Russia and a 
pensioner, also lives in the Russian Far East in an area relatively close to the brother.  The fiancee's mother remarried and moved to Finland. Applicant's daughter is now eleven years old and 
attends a special school for gifted and talented children.  Applicant wires his fiancee approximately $2,500 a month for her support and the support and education of their daughter.  He also sends 
approximately $200 per month for the support of his fiancee's grandmother.  (Tr. 130-137.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant speaks on the telephone about every day with his fiancee, who has a cell phone.  He also communicates with her by e-mail  The fiancee speaks with her brother by telephone about once a 
week.  She has less frequent telephone contact with her grandmother.  Applicant has apprised his managers and co-workers of his domestic situation.  It is not clear when he will be granted a visa to 
travel to see his fiancee and daughter. (Tr. 40, 56, 73-74, 133-135.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented four character witnesses and offered seven letters from co-workers and managers attesting to his strong work ethic, technical expertise, and professionalism.  (Ex. B though D.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I take administrative notice of political and economic instability in the Russian Federation, conditions which raise security concerns for U.S. citizens visiting or residing there, and, by extension, for 
those U.S. citizens who have family members residing in the Russian Federation. Tensions exist between the Russian military and the civilian government over resource allocation, restructuring, 
and reform.  (Government Documents for Administrative Notice II, III.)  The Russian Federation has a sophisticated intelligence capacity inherited from the former Soviet Union and continues to 
target U.S. military interests.  Russian  intelligence agents seek opportunities to penetrate U.S. intelligence and to acquire specific information on U.S. military capabilities.  They also use the 
Internet and Internet service providers to acquire and exploit critical information posted by U.S. businesses that can be used to their economic or military advantage.  (Government Document for 
Administrative Notice I.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I also take administrative notice that Georgia has been a democratic republic since October 1995.  Conflict in neighboring Chechnya and Abkhazia has resulted in an influx of approximately 
300,000 internally displaced persons who were driven from their homes.  Georgia's unstable political situation and culture of official governmental corruption have hampered domestic and foreign 
investment and kept its economic activity below potential.  (Government Document for Administrative Notice IV.)    </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  
The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions 
listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged, under Guideline B of the Directive, that Applicant's fiancee is a citizen and resident of Russia (&para; 1.a.); that Applicant's daughter is a citizen and resident of 
Russia (&para; 1.b.); that, at last report, the fiancee's father had a Soviet passport indicating Georgian nationality and may be in Georgia (&para; 1.c.); that the fiancee's brother is a citizen and resident of 
Russia (&para; 1.d.); that the fiancee's grandmother is a citizen and resident of Russia (&para; 1.e.); and that Applicant traveled to Russia in at least 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999 (&para; 1.f.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Guideline B security concern exists when an applicant's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he might be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  A person who places a high value on family obligations or fidelity to relationships in another country may be vulnerable to duress by the 
intelligence service of the foreign country or by agents in that country engaged in industrial espionage, terrorism or other criminal activity.  The more faithful an individual is to family ties and 
emotional commitments and obligations, the more likely the chance that the ties might be exploited to the detriment of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's case requires the recognition that the Russian Federation is politically and economically unstable, conditions that have been exploited by criminal and terrorist groups. Additionally, 
Russian intelligence agents seek to acquire specific information on U.S. military capabilities. Their actions threaten U.S. security interests.  American citizens with immediate family members who 
are citizens or residents of the Russian Federation could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, while the U.S. and Georgia have friendly relations, Georgia has internal problems with corruption, refugees, and an under-developed economy--issues that could give rise to 
exploitation or pressure.  Applicant's fiancee's father has Georgian nationality and may be in Georgia.  Applicant's fiancee has had no contact with her father for approximately 10 years and does 
not know where he is.  She and Applicant's daughter now live in the Russian Far East, thousands of miles from where her father might be residing.  Since Applicant's fiancee no longer has a 
relationship with her father, and since the father has no independent relationship with Applicant, who is not married to his daughter, the father of the fiancee does not appear to raise a security 
concern. Applicant provided information at the  hearing to rebut the SOR allegation that his fiance's father raised a Guideline B security concern. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant's other admissions raise several possible Guideline B security concerns.  Applicant's fiancee and his daughter are citizens and residents of the Russian Federation. The 
citizenship and residency of these immediate family members raise security concerns under E2.A2.1.2.1. of Guideline B.  Applicant's on-going support of and familial relationship with his fiancee, 
his daughter, and the daughter's great-grandmother raise security concerns under E2.A2.1.2.6. and E2.A2.1.2.8. and suggest he could be vulnerable to coercion, pressure or exploitation, and foreign 
influence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns by demonstrating that immediate family members, cohabitants, or associates are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the foreign associates and loyalty to the U.S.  Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign connections derived from a marriage-like relationship and not from birth can raise Guideline B security concerns.  In reviewing the scope of MC E2.A2.1.3.1., DOHA's Appeal Board has 
stated that the term "associate(s)" reasonably contemplates in-laws and close friends.  ISCR Case No. 02-12760, at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2005)  While the evidence does not establish that 
Applicant's fiancee and daughter are agents of a foreign power, they are citizens of the Russian Federation, as is the fiance's brother, with whom the fiancee has frequent contact.  Additionally, the 
fiancee's grandmother, who is supported in part by Applicant, is a citizen and resident of the Russian Federation.  The fiancee's contacts and relationships with the brother and grandmother raise 
security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Russian Federation, a country with an uncertain political and economic future, posses a sophisticated intelligence service inherited from the former Soviet Union.  That intelligence service 
actively seeks classified information on U.S. military capabilities.  Applicant offered no evidence to rebut the Government's assertion that his fiancee and daughter could be exploited by individuals 
in the Russian Federation in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to his fiancee and child and the security interests of the United States.  ISCR Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2005) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant traveled in 1994 and 1995 to visit his fiancee in the Russian Federation.  After his daughter was born, he traveled in 1996, 1998, and 1999 to visit his fiancee and his 
daughter.  He hopes to be able to travel to the Russian Federation again to marry his fiancee and bring her and the child to the U.S.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided his fiancee with $10,000 to establish a cosmetics business the city in the Russian Far East where she lives.  He sends his fiancee $2,500 each month for her support and the 
support and education of their daughter.  Applicant also sends his fiancee's grandmother $200 each month for her support. Applicant's travel to the Russian Federation, his investment activity, and 
his support of his fiancee, daughter, and the fiancee's grandmother raise security concerns under DC E2.A2.1.2.6. and E2.A2.1.2.8.  He was unable to rebut the assertion that this conduct, which 
was not the result of official U.S. government business, could make him vulnerable to foreign influence or pressure and affect his security responsibilities.  Accordingly, MC E2.A2.1.3.2. and 
E2.A5.1.3.5. do not apply to Applicant's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may also mitigate foreign influence security concerns if he shows his contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.  MC E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant speaks 
with his fiancee by telephone almost daily.  While his contacts with his fiancee's brother and grandmother appear to be infrequent, his relationship with his fiancee and their daughter is neither 
casual nor infrequent.  Additionally, he supports his fiancee's grandmother, which suggests a relationship that is not casual.  Accordingly, MC E2.A2.1.3.3. is inapplicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.2 of the Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance case not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful 
weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct (E2.2.1.1); 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation (E2.2.1.2); the frequency and recency of the conduct (E2.2.1.3); the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct (E2.2.1.4.); the voluntariness of participation (E2.2.1.5.); the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (E2.2.1.6); the motivation for the conduct 
(E2.2.1.7); the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.2.1.8.); and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence (E2.2.1.9).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record reflects that Applicant, a military analyst for a government contractor, is highly respected by his colleagues for his expertise and ability. He remains loyal to his relationship with his 
fiancee and their daughter, whom he has not seen since 1999.  Of particular concern in this case, however, is the potential for Applicant to be subject to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as 
a result of the citizenship of his fiancee and daughter, and the citizenship of the fiancee's brother and grandmother, who, in these circumstances, function as in-laws.  Additionally, Applicant's 
monthly monetary support of his fiancee, their daughter, and the fiancee's grandmother, and his investment of $10,000 to set up the fiancee in business in the Russian Far East are highly visible 
activities that could be exploited to pressure or coerce Applicant and heighten the risk for the protection of classified information.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nothing in Applicant's answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR suggested he was not a loyal American citizen. However, he failed to rebut or mitigate the security concerns alleged in 
subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. of the SOR and demonstrate he would not be vulnerable to foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in this proceeding.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based 
this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed and considered all of the evidence, and I have assessed Applicant's credibility and demeanor.  After weighing the applicable Guideline  B disqualifying and mitigating conditions, 
and after considering all relevant factors in the whole person analysis, I conclude Guideline B allegation 1.c. for the Applicant and Guideline B allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. in the SOR 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
