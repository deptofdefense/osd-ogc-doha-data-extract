</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	On 12 December 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. Applicant answered the SOR--26 December 1996--and
originally requested an administrative determination. However, on 28 March 1997 he requested a
hearing. The case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge on 22 April 1997, but
was reassigned to me on 14 May 1997. I issued a Notice of Hearing on 15 May 1997--amended
21 May 1997--and held the hearing 17 June 1997.</P>

<P>	At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits--admitted without
objection--and one witnesses, the Applicant; Applicant presented no exhibits and one witness. I
received the transcript on 30 June 1997.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Determination and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Through an administrative oversight, I initially set this case for a date Applicant had
indicated he was not available for hearing because his witness would not be available to testify.
Applicant made a timely request for continuance, the Government posed no objection, and in a
conference call on 21 May 1997 I rescheduled the hearing to 17 June 1997.</P>

<P>	At the hearing on 17 June 1997, Government counsel objected to two character letters
which Applicant had appended to his Answer to the SOR on the ground that the letters
constituted inadmissible hearsay. I overruled the objection on the ground that the rules of
evidence apply only as a guide in these hearings, and the interposed objections went more to the
weight to be given the  documents and not their admissibility.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the allegations of  the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate the admissions
as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 40-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks a security clearance.</P>

<P>	On 12 July 1996--while applying for his security clearance--Applicant answered "yes"
on an OPM Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) when asked whether he used
drugs --with or without a clearance--or had been arrested for any drug involvement.<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  On a 29
October 1996 sworn statement to the Defense Investigative Service (G.E. 2), Applicant
elaborated his drug abuse history.<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> He also elaborated his drug arrest history: In July 1973, he
was arrested on a group possession charge when some of Applicant's friends were smoking
marijuana. Applicant was arrested for possession even though he was not smoking marijuana and
did not have marijuana in his possession. He pleaded no contest and the charges were dismissed
in juvenile court. In January 1985, he was charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine.
Applicant was smoking marijuana with some friends in a parked car when a police patrol stopped
and asked them to get out of the car. The police found cocaine in the car; however, Applicant did
not know cocaine was in the car. Applicant received probation before judgment and the charge
was eventually dismissed. In August 1992, Applicant was the subject of a random border search
while returning by car from ------; the border guards found a roach clip in his possessions.
Applicant was charged with possession of paraphernalia and paid fines and fees of $1,000.</P>

<P>	Applicant's January 1985 arrest was reported to the DIS by Applicant's employer. On 16
April 1985, Applicant executed a sworn statement (G.E. 3) describing the January 1985 arrest.<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>
As a result of the DIS investigation, Applicant stopped using marijuana and did not resume his
marijuana use until he had his clearance terminated in 1991 when he left the employment that
required the security clearance. He intends no drug use in the future.<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant's supervisor for the last year is aware of Applicant's drug abuse history and
will not tolerate any drug use. However, he has not noticed any indication of continued drug use
in Applicant. Moreover, he considers Applicant very honest and unlikely to use drugs in his
present living environment.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT (CRITERION H)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>		(2) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(2) the drug involvement was an . . .infrequent event.</P>

<P>		(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.<U><STRONG></STRONG></U></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion H; however, I find the conduct to
be mitigated. Applicant's recreational use of marijuana from 1977 to 1985 and from 1991 to 1996
raises legitimate security concerns. He used marijuana without apparent regard for its illegality; from
October 1990 to sometime in 1985, he used marijuana without apparent regard for either its illegality
or the Government's security concerns. However, when Applicant's marijuana use put his clearance
at risk in 1985, Applicant stopped using marijuana. Although he resumed marijuana use when he had
no clearance, he stopped using when he obtained a job which required a clearance.  Applicant
realizes that drug use is incompatible with access to classified information. While his drug use was
recent, and certainly not isolated, the frequency of his drug use was fairly low--from 1991 to 1996
less than monthly<A HREF="96-0906.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>; I find no suggestion of physical or psychological dependence. The Government
correctly argues that the issue in this case is whether Applicant's stated intent to refrain from drug
use is credible. Although Applicant did use drugs while having a clearance from October 1981 to
1985, he did not use drugs from 1985 to 1991 while he had a clearance--conforming to DoD policy.
In 1996--before applying for a new clearance, if only shortly before--Applicant again brought
himself into compliance with Government policy. Under the circumstances, I think it unlikely that
Applicant will abuse drugs in the future. He has demonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the
future. I find criterion H. for the Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>He amplified those answers by reporting that he had been charged with marijuana possession in July 1973,
charged with marijuana and cocaine possession in May 1985, and charged with marijuana possession in August 1992.
Applicant reported using marijuana forty times from February 1992 to April 1996. He truthfully reported that he had
used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, but incorrectly reported those dates as February 1992-April 1996.
In fact, Applicant used marijuana while he had a clearance from October 1980 to 1985.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>"I began to use marijuana in about 1977 or 1978 while a sophomore in college. From then until I graduated
in 1980 I smoked marijuana infrequently, possibly once a month on a social basis. From 1980 to 1982, I probably only
used marijuana one or two times because I had moved away from home and only had the occasion to use it when
visiting back home with friends. From 1982 to 1985 I smoked marijuana about once every month or once every two
months while socializing with friends at parties. From 1985 to 1991 I did not use any marijuana because of holding a
security clearance at the time. From October 1991 to July 1992 I smoked marijuana approximately once monthly while
socializing with others. It was during this period of time that I made my only purchase of marijuana. I bought a half
ounce of marijuana for $200 through a friend of mine. I did not buy from a dealer as I knew no dealers. My marijuana
purchase was shared with others at social functions. I never used marijuana alone or for other than socializing. In July
1992 I moved back [home] and from July 1992 to May 1996 I may have used marijuana a total of 40 times while
socializing with friends. In May 1996 I learned that I was getting my new job with my current company so I decided
I would not use any more marijuana. . . . As for the future, I would like to get this clearance and I really do not want
drugs to jeopardize my future career. Marijuana is not important enough to me to jeopardize my future. . . . I have not
and would not ever use any other type of illegal drugs and I expect to use no marijuana in the future." Applicant's
testimony at the hearing (Tr. 31-43) is consistent with this reported drug use.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>This statement inaccurately asserted that the police initially found no evidence of drug use before conducting
a more extensive search of the car; Applicant's October 1996 statement acknowledges that he was smoking marijuana
at the time of the arrest. Because the Government did not allege falsification on this issue, I have not considered this
discrepancy as evidence of falsification, but I have considered it on the issue of Applicant's credibility.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>I considered very carefully the Government's argument that this stated intention should be given little weight
because Applicant had made the same promise to the DIS at the time of the April 1985 interview and then resumed
marijuana use.  However, the record reflects that Applicant stopped using marijuana in 1985--at approximately the time
of his DIS inquiry--and did not resume marijuana use until his clearance was terminated in 1991--when he left
employment requiring a clearance. I have also considered the Government's suggestion that Applicant's credibility is
suspect because of the circumstances of his obtaining his initial clearance in 1980. However, the record contains no firm
evidence supporting this inference. The Government has not alleged falsification of the 1980 clearance application, nor
has it otherwise demonstrated that Applicant falsified that application or was asked about his drug abuse and provided
untruthful answers.  Even had the Government produced such evidence--and thus arguably putting Applicant's
credibility at issue based on those falsifications--I would consider this evidence overcome by Applicant's truthful
completion of the 1996 clearance application and his extensive disclosures to the DIS in the October 1996 sworn
statement.
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>Applicant testified (Tr. 42-3) that he reached the estimated forty uses of marijuana between 1992 and 1996
by estimating monthly use of marijuana for four years, and rounding down because he did not actually use monthly.
