<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She has a long history of failing to meet her financial obligations and inability to pay her debts, 
extending from 1998 to the present.  When completing her security clearance questionnaire in 2001, Applicant fraudulently concealed delinquent debts.  In 
2002, Applicant was convicted in state court of obtaining financial aid through false pretenses.  She has not shown significant progress in resolving her 
delinquent debts.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising from her financial difficulties, criminal conduct, or personal conduct.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 21, 2001, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> 
(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On August 4, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  
The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of 
the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 23, 2004.  Applicant elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. </P> 
<P>I was assigned the case on November 3, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on December 8, 2004.  The department counsel 
introduced 11 exhibits.  Applicant presented a document admitted as Exhibit A and testified on her own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
December 28, 2004. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegations in &para;&para; 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 3.a, and 3.b of the SOR.  Answer to SOR, dated August 23, 2004, at 1-2.  She admitted the remaining factual 
allegations in the SOR, with explanations.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is 34 years old.  Ex.1 at 1.  She works as a technician for a defense contractor.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2. </P> 
<P>Applicant grew up under difficult circumstances.  Her mother was single and had trouble raising her children alone.  Applicant and her siblings were removed 
from their home at an early age.  Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated August 23, 2004, at 3-4.  When Applicant was still young, her mother took her children 
from their foster homes and fled to a neighboring state.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4.  </P> 
<P>Applicant became pregnant at age 16, and gave birth to a son in 1988.  <EM>Id.; </EM>Ex.1 at 4.  She had her second child in 1989 when she was 18 years old, and dropped 
out of high school.  Answer to SOR, <EM>supra</EM>, at 4<EM>.  </EM>Applicant lived on welfare for some time, but found it difficult to support her two children.  <EM>Id.</EM></P> 
<P>Applicant became involved in petty larceny and shoplifting.  <EM>Id.</EM>; Ex. 5 at 4.  Authorities arrested her in August, 1989, and charged her with petty theft.  Answer 
to SOR, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  A court found her guilty of the offense and sentenced her to a fine.  Ex. 5 at 4.  Applicant was arrested for petty theft for the second time in 
arch, 1992.  <EM>Id.</EM>  She was convicted of that crime and sentenced to pay court fees and serve 21 days house arrest.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant recalls the judge giving 
"fatherly" advice about the importance of getting an education and finding a new direction for her life.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>Applicant returned to high school and graduated in 1995.  <EM>Id.</EM>  In 1996, she moved to her present area and lived with her sister for a time.  <EM>Id.</EM>  She signed up for 
welfare to assist her in supporting her two children.  Tr. at 19-20.  Applicant found employment sporadically.  She worked in shipping and receiving for a major 
corporation for several months, and later worked for a delivery service for several weeks.  Tr. at 19-20.  Applicant failed to inform the welfare agency of her 
employment, and continued accepting welfare benefits and food stamps.  Tr. at 20-21.</P> 
<P>During this time, Applicant accumulated debts she could not pay.  She was unable to pay a dishonored check to a local department store (&para; 1.e, SOR), became 
indebted to a local drug store for a second dishonored check (&para; 1.g, SOR), and accumulated substantial unpaid telephone bills (&para;&para; 1.m and 1.n, SOR).  She 
joined a fitness club and visited a few times, but was unable to pay the entire contract amount of $963.00 (&para; 1.c, SOR).  Her checking account was overdrawn 
and Applicant was unable to pay it, resulting in a $540.00 debt (&para; 1.k).  In 1998, Applicant fell behind on her rent payment.  Tr. at 34.  She was sued for back 
rent, went to court, and had a judgment entered against her for about $1,500.00 (&para; 1.0, SOR).  Applicant was also evicted.  Tr. at 34-35.</P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P>Applicant attended a technical institute between 1998 and 2000, and obtained an associates degree.  Ex. 1 at 2.  She worked for a computer company for several 
months in 2000.  Tr. at 22.  Applicant continued to receive welfare and food stamps during this time, but did not inform authorities of her employment.</P> 
<P>In December 2000, Applicant began working for her current employer as a technician.  Tr. at 25; Ex. 1 at 2.  Applicant completed an SF 86, Security Clearance 
Application, on August 21, 2001.  Ex. 1 at 1.  Question 37 of that form inquired whether Applicant had any unpaid judgments within the preceding seven years.  
Applicant answered "No," to that question.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 7.  Applicant did not list the unpaid judgment in favor of her former landlord.  Question 39 on the SF 86 
asked whether Applicant was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts.  Applicant answered that question "Yes," but listed only a single delinquent 
automobile loan.  <EM>Id</EM>.  Applicant did not list her other delinquent debts.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 8.</P> 
<P>After starting her current job, Applicant accumulated other unpaid bills.  She was not able to pay credit card debts in the amount of $599.00 and $120.00 (&para;&para; 1.a 
and 1.b, SOR).  She incurred a $108.00 debt which she could not pay for a pager service (&para; 1.j, SOR).  Applicant was unable to pay utility service bills, 
resulting in a judgment entered against her in the amount of $1,127.10 (&para; 1.p, SOR).  </P> 
<P>In July 2002, the state brought criminal charges against Applicant for fraudulently receiving welfare benefits and food stamps while she was employed.  Ex. 9 at 
11.  The state charged her with three felony offenses: one count of obtaining financial aid through misrepresentation and two counts of perjury by false 
application.  <EM>Id.</EM>  In August 2002, Applicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor offense included in Charge I and the government dismissed the remaining charges.  
Ex. 9 at 3.  Applicant was sentenced to pay $3,713.00 in restitution and to perform 120 hours of community service.  Ex. 4 at 1.  </P> 
<P>Applicant subsequently obtained her bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.  Tr. at 11. She is currently working on a master's degree.  Ex. 5 at 5.  </P> 
<P>Applicant looked into debt consolidation, but decided the service was too expensive.  Tr. at 46-47.  In July, 2004, Applicant contacted a local law center and 
initiated action to file for personal bankruptcy.  Ex. A.  At the time of the hearing on December 8, 2004, Applicant did not know if her counsel had filed a 
petition for bankruptcy.  Tr. at 44.  Applicant has not otherwise sought credit counseling.  Tr. at 45.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently

Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive, 
&para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive, 
&para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P>

comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM> <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if the evidence reveals "[a] history of not meeting financial 
obligations.<EM>"</EM>  Similarly, &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 indicates that an "[i]nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts" may be disqualifying.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a long history of not 
meeting her financial obligations.  She has debts totaling over $10,000.00 that have remained unpaid for many years.  Applicant admitted all the delinquent 
debts listed in the SOR except those in &para;&para; 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f.  Considering all the evidence, I find that all the debts listed in the SOR apply, except those at &para;&para; 1.c, 
1.d, and 1.f.  I find Applicant has shown both a history of failing to meet her financial obligations and an inability to satisfy her debts.  I conclude both these 
potentially disqualifying conditions apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from Applicant's financial difficulties can be mitigated under certain circumstances.  Under the Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.1, it may 
be mitigating where "the behavior was not recent."  Some of Applicant's delinquent debts date from 1998, thus the original indebtedness is not recent.  
However, a large number of the debts remain unpaid at this time.  I find Applicant's inability to pay delinquent debts is recent, therefore this mitigating 
condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.3.2 of the Directive provides that it may be mitigating where the financial difficulty "was an isolated incident."  Applicant's numerous 
delinquent debts arose over many years because of a variety of reasons.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply<EM>.<STRONG></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A6.1.3.3, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Applicant indicated that some of her delinquent debts 
arose when she was unemployed or underemployed.  An unexpected loss of employment may be a circumstance beyond an individual's control and could 
mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  However, I note her employment history was sporadic for many years, reducing to some extent 
the "unexpected" nature of the loss of income.  Moreover, Applicant did not make a significant effort to pay these debts after she began her present employment 
in December 2000; to the contrary, she incurred even more delinquent debt.  I am not persuaded by Applicant's evidence that this mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Proof that "[t]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control," may be mitigating, under &para; E2.A6.1.3.4 of the Directive.  Applicant sought some financial counseling by looking into a debt consolidation plan and 
contacting a legal services company for assistance in filing bankruptcy.   However, there is no evidence Applicant made any payments of delinquent debts as a 
result of this counseling, or that she actually initiated bankruptcy proceedings.  There is no evidence of a formal plan to repay or resolve her delinquent debts, 
therefore I cannot find that her debt problem is under control or is being resolved.  I find this mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, it may be mitigating where "[t]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."  Directive, &para; 
E2.A6.1.3.6.  As noted above, Applicant made no significant payment toward the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  While she contacted a legal services 
company to pursue bankruptcy, there is no evidence she filed the bankruptcy petition or otherwise initiated an effort to resolve the debts.  I conclude this 
mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from her history of failing to meet her financial obligations and her inability to pay her debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, it is potentially disqualifying where the evidence shows "admission of criminal conduct" (&para; E2.A10.1.2.1) or a "single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses" (&para; E2.A10.1.2.2).  A court found Applicant guilty of misdemeanor offenses in 1989, 1992, and 2002.  Applicant admitted engaging in 
petty theft and accepting welfare while employed.  As discussed below, I find Applicant also falsely omitted material and relevant information about her 
delinquent debts when she completed her Personnel Security Application in August 2001.  I find both these potentially disqualifying conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A10.1.3.1 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he criminal behavior was not recent."  Applicant's petty theft occurred in 1989 and 1992.  
I find the this criminal behavior was not recent therefore this potentially mitigating condition applies to those offenses.  I also find that Applicant's acceptance 
of welfare benefits while employed and her omissions from her personnel security application were recent.  Thus, this potentially mitigating condition does not 
apply to those crimes.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A10.1.3.2 applies where "[t]he crime was an isolated event."  Applicant had  two criminal convictions for petty theft.  She also committed two 
offenses involving fraud or dishonesty.  I cannot find that any of these crimes was an isolated event, therefore this potentially mitigating condition does not 
apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A10.1.3.4 it may be mitigating where "the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur."  Similarly, under &para; E2.A10.1.3.6 it may be 
mitigating where "[t]here is clear evidence of rehabilitation."  Applicant made great strides in obtaining her education and turning her life around.  Undoubtedly 
she faced enormous pressures in obtaining her education and beginning a career while raising two children.  However, at critical times she made some very poor 
choices and provided false information for her short-term financial benefit.  This tends to show that she is unusually vulnerable to financial pressures.  While 
Applicant has gone on to complete her bachelor's degree and has held her job for several years, her financial difficulties continue.  I am not persuaded that 
Applicant has shown clear evidence of rehabilitation.  Weighing all the available evidence, I find these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply in this 
case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant's convictions for petty theft in 
1989 and 1992 are mitigated. However, considering the later offenses, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal 
conduct.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant's personal conduct that may be potentially disqualifying.  Paragraph E2.A5.1.2.1 provides that 
"[r]eliable, unfavorable information" tending to show questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, may indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Applicant's history of failing to meet her 
financial obligations tends to show questionable judgment, unreliability, and a lack of trustworthiness.  I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of the Directive, "[t]he deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire" may be disqualifying.  Paragraph 3.a of the SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to report on her security clearance application an unpaid 
judgment (&para; 1.o, SOR) incurred within the preceding seven years.  Applicant asserts she was aware of the 1998 lawsuit and the court order to pay money to her 
landlord, but did not realize it constituted a "judgment."  Considering all the evidence, including her demeanor at the hearing, I find Applicant did not 
understand the definition of "judgment," and did not intend to deceive the government with her negative response.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 3.b of the SOR also alleges Applicant falsified material facts on her security clearance application by listing only one debt in response to Question 39 
inquiring about all debts then over 90 days delinquent.  Considering the number of delinquent debts and the outstanding court order, the dates they arose, and all 
the circumstances in the case, I find Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed relevant and material facts by listing only one debt in response to Question 39 
on her personnel security clearance questionnaire.  This potentially disqualifying condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5 of the Directive, evidence of "[a] pattern of dishonesty" may be disqualifying.  The evidence reveals Applicant was less than 
candid with the state government concerning her eligibility for welfare benefits.  She was also dishonest in her response to the personnel security questionnaire.  
I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from questionable personal conduct may be mitigated under certain circumstances.  Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.3.  
Under &para; E2.A5.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where "[t]he information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or 
reliability.<STRONG>"</STRONG>  Applicant's admissions and the government evidence demonstrate the information about Applicant's financial difficulties and her dishonest 
conduct is substantiated.  Also, the information was pertinent to a determination of her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  I find this mitigating factor 
does not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A5.1.3.2 of the Directive arises where "the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual subsequently provided correct 
information voluntarily."  The available evidence shows Applicant was less than honest on several occasions, therefore I cannot find either was an isolated 
incident.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the 
facts."  Applicant admitted her debts to security investigators.  However, she has not met her burden of proving that she initiated the efforts at correction, or that 
her efforts were prompt.  I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.  I also considered carefully the other potentially mitigating conditions and 
conclude they do not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns arising from her personal conduct.</SPAN></P>
