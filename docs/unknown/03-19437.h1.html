<P>Applicant's parents and an aunt are Iraqi citizens. Her parents have permanent resident alien status with a home of record in the United States, but the aunt still 
lives in Iraq. Since 1999, her parents returned to Iraq periodically for medical care. They now live in the U.S. and do not plan to return to Iraq. On her security 
application (SF 86), Applicant listed her parents' home of record despite the fact they were abroad for an extended stay at the time. She has mitigated the 
resulting foreign influence, personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On January 26, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J 
(criminal conduct).</P> 
<P>On February 9, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to an Administrative Judge but was 
transferred to me on July 2, 2004. I convened a hearing in this matter on August 26, 2004. At hearing, Department Counsel submitted nine exhibits (GE 1 - 9) 
in support of the SOR.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant, through counsel, submitted four exhibits (AE A - D) and the testimony of four witnesses, including the Applicant. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 8, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR paragraph 1, but denied those in paragraphs 2 and 3. Her admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a 
thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 45 years old and, along with her husband, owns a small information technology  company doing business with the Department of Defense. 
Applicant was born in Iraq. After earning her engineering degree in Iraq, she moved to Great Britain in 1979 to study for a masters degree in engineering. She 
returned to Iraq in 1980, but emigrated to the United States in 1991, shortly after the first Gulf War, with her first husband and two children, then ages 10 and 6. 
She has not returned to Iraq and has no future plans to do so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was raised in the Armenian Christian tradition. As a non-Muslim and a female in Iraq, she felt disenfranchised and looked down upon, conditions 
that contributed to her desire to leave Iraq and build a life in America. Applicant has no financial or property interests there and has no ties to any former or 
current Iraqi government organizations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant divorced her first husband, an Iraqi citizen who has since become a naturalized  U.S. citizen, in September 1997. The same month, she herself was 
naturalized and has raised her children in the United States. Her son recently graduated from a prominent U.S. university and works for a major U.S. 
corporation; her daughter is studying engineering at a U.S. university. Applicant married her current husband, a native-born United States citizen, in March 
1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's elderly parents are both Iraqi citizens who obtained U.S. permanent resident alien (PRA) status in December 1999. Her father is a retired scientist 
who specialized in animal husbandry after receiving his bachelors and masters degrees from universities in the United States where he lived and studied 
between 1948 and about 1962. He now is in his 80s, retired from his job in the Iraqi agricultural industry since 1982, and suffers from a variety of serious health 
problems. Applicant's mother, an Armenian Christian, worked in administrative jobs for 22 years for British Petroleum (BP) in Iraq. She continued working for 
a short time after BP was nationalized as the Iraqi Oil Ministry, retiring in 1976. Applicant's mother is in her 70s and has serious health concerns as well. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since receiving PRA status, Applicant's parents have traveled back to Iraq by way of Jordan to receive medical care they could not obtain in the United States 
because of their immigration status. They stay in those locations from two to three months each time rather than travel back and forth because the travel is 
physically taxing and some of their treatment is extensive. When in Iraq, they stay in a home they have owned for several years. They have spent, on average, 
nine to ten months of each year in the U.S. since 1999. However, they use Applicant's brother's address in the United States as their home of record. The same 
address is listed on Applicant's father's U.S. driver's license. As of this hearing, Applicant's parents were expected to return to the U.S. the next month and 
remain permanently so they could apply for U.S. citizenship, for which they would be eligible in December 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a Personnel Security Clearance (SF 86) on April 8, 2003. This is the first time she has applied for a security clearance, and it was 
occasioned by the fact she and her husband were seeking work for their company as part of a joint venture with another defense contractor. Their venture was 
new at the time and her husband acted as the company facility security officer, but he had no background or training in that role and there was no one to give 
them advice or answer questions about the form.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to SF 86 question 9, which asks for information about her relatives, including place and date of birth and a current address, she disclosed that her 
parents were Iraqi and provided her parents' U.S. address. At the time she completed the form, she knew her parents were overseas, either in Jordan or in Iraq. 
Applicant interpreted the form (Question 9) as soliciting her what she thought was her parents' home of record since their arrival in 1999 and not their 
whereabouts at the time. She also disclosed her parents' citizenship and immigration status in response to SF 86 question 10. When interviewed by a Defense 
Security Service (DSS) agent five months later, she provided accurate and comprehensive information about her own foreign background and her parents' 
circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also has a maternal aunt who is a citizen of and still resides in Iraq. The last time she saw her aunt was at least 15 years ago, before Applicant left Iraq 
for good. The only contact she has had with her aunt since has been through sporadic phone calls between her mother and her aunt. Applicant's aunt is an 
elderly, retired school teacher with no ties to any foreign government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant and her parents left Iraq, the country was ruled by a totalitarian regime that had warred against its neighbors and the United States, had 
committed crimes against humanity, and which stifled any hint of democratic process for its citizens. Largely isolated from the rest of the world after the first 
Gulf War, Iraq's former regime is alleged to have supported international terrorism and did engage in aggressive intelligence gathering against the United 
States. However,  in March 2003, the United States and Great Britain invaded Iraq, arrested or killed the heads of its government, including its intelligence 
service, and have spent the intervening time re-building Iraq, instituting a provisional government of U.S. and U.S.-backed officials, and is trying to stabilize 
the country so that democratic elections can be held there for the first time in several decades.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the efforts of U.S. and allied forces, Iraq remains a very dangerous place for anyone even remotely aligned with efforts to reshape Iraq's 
government. The risks of kidnappings, suicide bombings, and random acts of terror is not limited to American targets, but has victimized Iraqis and other 
foreign nationals alike. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enjoys a reputation for honesty, diligence and commitment to her community here in the U.S. She is active in her church and has been successful in 
her personal and professional life since arriving in the U.S. nearly 14 years ago. She has never had any contact with the old Iraqi regime.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline B (foreign influence), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal 
conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears an initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security concerns arise when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or 
she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations create the potential for 
foreign influence that might, in turn, result in a compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other 
countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the concern 
is focused on Applicant's ties of affection to her parents and to her mother's sister, all of whom are citizens of a foreign country, and one of whom (her aunt) 
still lives in a foreign country. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel has presented sufficient evidence to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under Guideline B. The Applicant has close ties of 
affection who are citizens of and / or resident in a foreign country. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents have had PRA status since December 1999, but have returned to Iraq for 
long periods of time since then for medical reasons. They have also stayed in Jordan for safety reasons during the months immediately before and during the 
U.S. invasion of Iraq. (SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) Applicant's parents were each employed by the Iraqi government at one time (SOR 1.d and 1.e), and Applicant's 
maternal aunt is an Iraqi citizen still living there. Guideline B disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response, Applicant has shown her parents now spend most of their time in the U.S. and intend to remain in the U.S. after September 2004. They also intend 
to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as they are eligible. As for their stays overseas, Applicant provided a plausible explanation based on her parents' poor 
health and inability to access affordable health care in the U.S. It is also reasonable that they would stay in the region, but out of harm's way, in Jordan during 
the 2003 invasion. Further, Applicant's parents have been retired from their government jobs for over 20 years. They have not been contacted by the former 
Iraqi regime nor any indication they maintained any contacts with that government after they retired. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same holds true for Applicant's aunt, a retired school teacher in Iraq. Even were her aunt's circumstances different, Applicant has had only minimal contact 
with her aunt in the past 15 years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The current reality is that the U.S. is the prevailing governmental entity in Iraq, but that country remains a very dangerous place because of ongoing resistance 
by remnants of the previous regime and other groups trying to counter U.S. efforts there. Because Iraq is such a dangerous place, Applicant's parents' decision 
to live in the U.S. would eliminate the likelihood, already remote, that Applicant's parents or aunt would be targeted in order to exert pressure on Applicant. 
Guideline B mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies with respect to Applicant's parents and her aunt. MC 3<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies with respect to her aunt. On balance, I 
conclude the available information shows Applicant has met her burden in response to the government's case and has mitigated the security concerns under 
Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E (personal conduct), a security concern may arise where it is shown an applicant has shown poor judgment, dishonesty, or trustworthiness. 
This guideline may also apply in cases where an applicant's conduct shows a willingness to disregard rules and regulations, and where there is conduct of a 
questionable or embarrassing nature.<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government's concern is that Applicant allegedly deliberately falsified her SF 86 when she listed a U.S. address 
for her parents when they allegedly lived in Iraq. (SOR 2.a) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the facts presented, I conclude the government has not established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. DC 2<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is potentially 
applicable here; however, application of DC 2 requires that the Applicant acted deliberately to mislead the government about relevant and material information. 
The totality of the evidence on this point shows that Applicant's parents have had PRA status since 1999 and have used a their son's address for immigration 
records and for things like a driver's license and social security cards. Applicant, completing an SF 86 for the first time without benefit of knowledgeable 
advice about what was expected in this circumstance, had a choice between listing a U.S. address for her parents and listing an Iraqi address she was not sure 
was still valid. Nor was she sure her parents were even there. She also had to consider the fact her parents had spent most of their time in the U.S., at least 
during the preceding year. She made a deliberate choice to list the U.S. address, but I do not conclude based on this record that the information was false or 
misleading. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In fact, in the same response about her parents, she disclosed they were born in Iraq, so the government was on notice they were possible foreign ties of 
affection. Comprehensive information about her parents' travels between Iraq and the U.S. as well as their immigration status was disclosed at the Applicant's 
subject interview in September 2003. MC 2 and MC 4 apply here. In consideration of the mitigating information presented here, and mindful of the factors set 
forth in Directive, Section E2.2.1,<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I conclude Guideline E for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because such conduct may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, and may show 
the applicant to be lacking in reliability and trustworthiness. Here, there is a single allegation of criminal conduct is based on Applicant's alleged falsification of 
her SF 86, which, if proved, is a violation of federal law. (SOR 3.a) Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1001, makes it a crime to knowingly and 
willfully make a false statement or representation to any department or agency of the United States concerning a matter within its jurisdiction. As discussed 
above, I conclude the information Applicant provided was not false or misleading; nor was there an intent to deceive the government about her parents 
whereabouts or circumstances. None of the listed disqualifiers apply and I conclude Guideline J for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-19437.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> of the record before me mitigates the government's concerns about Applicant's ability to protect classified 
information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. I conclude it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's request for a security clearance.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
