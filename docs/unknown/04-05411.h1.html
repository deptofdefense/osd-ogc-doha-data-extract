<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On </SPAN>December<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 
2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">January 6, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 5, 2005, 
Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.

and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 22, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-7). No documents were offered by Applicant.</SPAN></P>

The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. through 1.e. under 
Guideline E. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P>

drugs. However, since all of these drugs were used by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> before the time period specified in the SCA, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was not required to include these drugs in his answer to question #27 (Exhibits 1

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #29 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">of the SCA asked if in the last 7 years Applicant had been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, or sales of any drugs for his own intended profit or that of another?  
Applicant answered "No" to this question.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He failed to disclosed that he had purchased small amount of marijuana with his friends (Exhibit 5). There is no indication that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> purchased the 
marijuana for profit. The evidence that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> purchased only small quantities with his friends seems to suggest that it was not for profit, so I cannot find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was inaccurate on question 
#29, by not including his marijuana purchases.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> completed another SCA on February 27, 2005, (Exhibit 7), which was after the SOR was drafted on December 15, 2004.

An individual may not arbitrarily fail to disclose information to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> because he believes it could hurt his interest or he thinks it is not relevant.  </SPAN></P><P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given "binding" 
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically 
determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the 
world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the 
national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. The 
Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug usage, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct, and 
that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the 
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security 
clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the 
Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline E -Personal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the Government less than complete, honest answers, regarding his employment history, his alcohol related police record, 
and his marijuana usage, in two </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">SCAs, completed on</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">March 6, 2003, and February 27, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish relevant 
information to a Government investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I 
conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers to the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> deliberately provided false and  misleading information to the
