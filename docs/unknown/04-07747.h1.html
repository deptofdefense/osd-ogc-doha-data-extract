<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On June 22, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. </P> 
<P>In a written statement dated July 11, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR,  and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on 
September 20, 2005.  Notice of the hearing was issued October 13, 2005, scheduling the hearing for November 2, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  
The transcript (Tr.) was received November 23, 2005.</P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  The 
President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates 
loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting 
allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information."<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  
Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="04-07747.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts</EM>; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: <EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><STRONG>Financial Considerations. </STRONG> The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) 1 arises 
where there is <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>.  Similarly, FC DC 3 applies where the information shows an <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts.</EM>  The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of financial problems.  While he has had several periods of unemployment, he has 
accumulated these debts over several years.  And the debts were unaffected by his inconsistent employment.  Further, his five year period of under withholding 
of incomes taxes shows irresponsible management of his finances.  I conclude that FC DC 1 and FC DC 3  apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only mitigating condition (MC) that could apply is FC MC 6 <EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts</EM>.  Applicant testified that he  made payments.  When given the opportunity to produce evidence of those facts, he did not provide adequate evidence.  The 
copies of checks made payable to creditors is nothing more than evidence of an intent to pay creditors.  The cancelled checks were not produced.  I am 
concerned about the date sequence on the copies he did provide.  He offered no proof that the IRS accepted his offer in compromise.  There is no evidence of a 
good faith effort to repay creditors.  FC MC 6 does not apply.  I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct.  </STRONG>The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's response on his security clearance application to question 38 falls 
within personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC 2)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>. </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if Applicant's excuse that since he was making payments on these debts he was not "delinquent" is accepted, the question asked if he had <STRONG><EM>ever</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> been 
delinquent.  He had been delinquent, especially underpaying income taxes for five years.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His answer that he was no longer delinquent enforces that he knew he 
had been delinquent for some periods of time.  He had not sought the help of a credit counseling service, and offered no proof of his claim that he was 
beginning to use the assistance of his employer's services.  He stated, "I believe that they would have those type of services."  That indicates that they were 
available but that he had not started using those services.  If he was working with them, he provided no proof in his December 2005 submission.  I find a willful 
failure to list these debts in his answer to question 38.  He did not present sufficient evidence to support any of the Guideline E mitigating conditions.  
Accordingly, I conclude the SOR allegations under Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have made a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record as required by Directive Section E2.2.3.  This record raises both  reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's 
ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its 
interests</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
