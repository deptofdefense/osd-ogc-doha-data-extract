<P>Applicant refuted allegations she intentionally falsified answers to questions on her security clearance application regarding her employment record, security 
clearance history, and financial delinquencies.  The security concern based on her history of delinquent debts is mitigated by her good-faith efforts to resolve 
them.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 11, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary 
decision to deny Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
</EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> 
(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), J (Criminal Conduct), and F 
(Financial Considerations).  Under Guideline E, it alleges Applicant falsified answers on her SF 86 pertaining to her employment record (&para;&para; 1.a. and 1.c.), her 
security clearance history (&para;&para; 1.b. and 1.d.), and her financial delinquencies (&para;&para; 1.e. and 1.f.).  Under Guideline J, it alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, 
based on the conduct alleged under Guideline E.  Under Guideline F, it alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $11, 399 (&para;&para; 3.a.-3.g.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated document.  She denied the allegations under Guidelines E and J.  In response to the allegations under 
Guideline J, she disputed one debt (&para; 3.a.), denied two (&para;&para; 3.b. and 3.c.), and asserted four had been resolved (&para;&para; 3.c.-3.g.).  She requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case 
was assigned to me on December 8, 2005, and heard on January 12, 2006 as scheduled.  I kept the record open until January 30, 2006, to enable Applicant to 
submit additional documentary evidence.  I received her additional evidence on January 17, 2006, and it is incorporated in the record as Applicant's Exhibit 
(AX) L.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 19, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.  Except for one brief period, she has worked for defense contractors since May 1991.  She 
first received a security clearance in June 1994.  She was married in September 1988 and divorced in June 1997.  She has one child whom she raised as a single 
parent.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant lived in a rented apartment from January 1992 until May 1996.  She had a 12-month lease with a provision allowing her to hold over as a month-to-month tenant and to vacate with a 30-day notice.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In May 31, 1996, she moved out and immediately moved into her new home.  She did not comply with the 
30-day notice requirement, and she was aware she might be liable for one month's rent.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The manager demanded four month's rent (SOR &para; 3.a.).<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After a 
lengthy dispute, Applicant and the apartment manager negotiated a settlement, and on March 5, 2005, Applicant paid the agreed amount in full.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1997, a judgment in the amount of $668.22 for a medical bill was entered against Applicant. (SOR &para; 3.b.).<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated 
she was unaware of the judgment until long after it was entered against her.  She was involved in a serious accident in 1993, but she believed her attorney had 
settled all medical bills arising from the accident.  She requested information from the doctor's office, but they were unable to find any records supporting the 
amount claimed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1997, Applicant was hired as a network administrator by a contractor for a government agency.  In January 1999, she was accused of giving a 
classified document to an unauthorized person.  She denied the allegation.  Although it appears her employer believed her, she was denied access to the 
government agency's facility and unable to work on her employer's contract with that agency.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  On January 25, 1999, she was notified her employment was 
terminated because she could not comply with the condition of her contract requiring her to secure and maintain a security clearance.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant believed she had been wrongfully terminated, and she retained an attorney to contest the revocation of her security clearance.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  In response to the 
attorney's request for all documents pertaining to the revocation of her clearance, the government agency responded that her clearance had not been revoked, 
but her clearance obtained by her predecessor employer had lapsed and had not been renewed by her then-current employer.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant worked in the private sector for a short time as a software tester, and then was hired by another federal contractor.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In August 1999, Applicant's 
employer told her she needed a periodic reinvestigation of her eligibility for continuing to hold a security clearance.  She sought advice from her security 
manager and her attorney regarding disclosure of her termination of employment by her former employer.  She was advised to answer "no" to question 22 on 
the SF 86, asking whether she was fired or left employment under unfavorable circumstances, and to explain the circumstances under which she was 
terminated.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 1999, Applicant executed a handwritten SF 86.  She answered "no" to question 22 and wrote the following comments in the "Continuation 
Space" at the end of the form: "Item #22 Left [former employer] at [government agency's] request that I not work in [the agency's] controlled space.  [Former 
employer] did not have suitable position available to place me in at that time.  An attorney was retained to investigate the matter."<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The electronically 
transmitted SF 86 dated October 5, 1999, reflected a negative answer"no" to the comparable question (question 20), and a negative answer to question 43, 
asking if Applicant had an additional remarks to enter.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 9, 2001, Applicant submitted an electronic SF 86 to her security manager, with the same handwritten explanation as contained on the handwritten SF 
86 executed in September 1999.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Her explanation was handwritten because the computer program, as it existed at that time, contained program errors that 
would not permit entry of explanatory comments.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  An electronically transmitted SF 86 dated March 20, 2001, contained the same negative answers, but 
without the explanatory comments.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SF 86 dated March 20, 2001, also contained negative answers to question 38 (debts more than 180 days delinquent during past seven years), and question 
39 (current debts more than 90 days delinquent).  Applicant's credit report dated March 26, 2003, reflected a delinquent credit card account (SOR &para; 3.c.), and an 
unpaid cell phone bill (&para; 3.d.).<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Her credit report dated January 11, 2005, reflected a collection account originated from a department store charge account (&para; 
3e.) and two delinquent credit card accounts (&para;&para; 3.f. and 3.g.)<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  She disputed the credit card debt alleged in &para; 3.c., stating she had never had a credit card from 
that alleged creditor.  The credit bureau resolved the dispute in her favor and removed it from her credit report.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Applicant's credit report dated October 26, 
2005 shows the debt alleged in &para; 3.g. was settled in January 2005; the debts alleged in &para;&para; 3.d. and 3.e. were settled in March 2005; and the debt alleged in &para; 3.f. 
was settled in June 2005.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying her answers to questions 38 and 39, asserting none of the delinquent debts listed on the credit reports 
were more than 90 days delinquent at the time she executed the SF 86.  Her credit reports support her denial, because they show her debts did not begin to be 
reported as delinquent until after she executed her SF 86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted four letters of appreciation and commendation from several government officials, attesting to her performance before she was terminated 
by her former employer.  The letters attest to her pleasant personality, expertise, and dedication.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  A coworker in her current job describes her as "a woman of 
great integrity" who enjoys the utmost respect of trust of her colleagues.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant serves on her town council.  The town mayor, who has known her for ten years, regards her as very honest, diligent, committed, and an excellent 
parent.<A HREF="03-25388.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) 
may arise from "[r]eliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances."  Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.2.1.  The allegation in SOR &para; 1.b. was based on information from a former employer that Applicant's security clearance had been revoked by a 
government agency.  Applicant presented documentation from that agency establishing her clearance had never been revoked but had been allowed to lapse by 
her employer.  I conclude Applicant has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 1.b.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may apply where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal 
security questionnaire.  Directive &para;E2.A5.1.2.2..  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an 
omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the 
record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time the omission 
occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows Applicant was advised by her attorney and facility security manager to answer "no" to the question about her employment record and to 
explain the circumstances under which she lost her job.  She complied with that advice, but her explanations could not be entered on the electronic SF 86.  She 
manually supplied her security manager with her explanatory comments.  I conclude she has refuted the allegations of intentional falsification in SOR &para;&para; 1a., 
1.c., and 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied she was more than 90 days delinquent on any debts when she executed her SF 86 in March 2001.  Her credit reports 
support her denial, because they show her debts did not begin to be reported as delinquent until after March 2001.  She disclosed the unpaid judgment alleged in 
SOR &para; 3.b. on her SF 86.  I am satisfied she did not intentionally falsify her answers regarding delinquent debts.  I conclude she has refuted the allegations 
under SOR &para;&para; 1.e. and 1.f.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J: (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, a single serious offense can raise a security concern (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a felony, punishable by a fine or 
imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in 
any matter within the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a 
serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The conduct alleged under this guideline is the same conduct alleged under Guideline E.  For the reasons stated above under the discussion of Guideline E, I 
conclude Applicant has refuted the allegations under Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant 
has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  The evidence of Applicant's delinquent debts alleged in the SOR &para;&para; 3.d.-3.g. establishes DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant had multiple delinquent debts that were only recently resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not 
established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, they do not necessarily mitigate security 
concerns unless she acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.  ISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant purchased a home in June 1996 and assumed the responsibility for paying the mortgage.  She was divorced a year later and became solely responsible 
for raising her child.  She was terminated from her job in January 1999 and incurred legal expenses attempting to contest her termination.  She continued to 
meet most of her financial obligations, but fell behind on the four debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 3.d.-3.g.  Her delinquent debts did not begin to accrue until after she 
submitted her SF 86 in 2001, two years after her wrongful termination.  She did not explain how her various misfortunes ending in 1999 caused her to be fall 
behind more than two years later.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude she has not carried her burden of establishing MC 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under 
pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began rectifying her financial situation when she learned it was a security concern.  She resolved her dispute over the debt alleged in SOR &para; 3.a.  She 
successfully disputed the debt alleged in &para; 3.b.  She paid the debt alleged in &para; 3.g. before receiving the SOR, and she resolved the remaining three shortly
