<P>In 1995, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to resolve debts and other obligations totaling more than $95,000. He not only failed to complete 
the repayment plan, he also accrued more than $19,000 in new delinquencies. As of June 2003, he had sufficient cash flow to pay down the new debts, but took 
no significant action to do so until just before this hearing. He also deliberately omitted from his most recent security clearance application (SF 86) relevant 
information about his debts and a prior criminal indictment. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On December 3, 2004, DOHA issued 
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant timely answered the SOR (Answer), admitted all but five<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of the allegations, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 24, 2005, and I convened a hearing on September 20, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and introduced three exhibits (AE A, B, 
and C), which were admitted without objection. I left the record open after hearing to allow Applicant time to submit additional information I deemed relevant 
and material to the issues herein. Applicant timely submitted two additional exhibits, which I have admitted without objection as AE D and E.  DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr) on October 5, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 35 years old and employed by a defense contractor as an engineering specialist. He was hired in May 2000 and seeks to renew a security clearance 
he has held continuously since he joined the U.S. Navy in 1988. He served in the Navy as an electrician's mate and had risen to the rank of Petty Officer Second 
Class (EM2; paygrade E-5) at the time of his discharge in July 1998. Before he was hired for his current job, Applicant worked for two years as a marine 
electrician. He is in the last semester of course work required to earn his degree in educational workforce development.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a 13-year-old daughter who lives with her mother in another state. Applicant pays about $360 each month in child support. Applicant was 
recently married for the first time in July 2002. His wife has two children from a previous marriage, one of whom requires ongoing medical attention costing 
more than Applicant's medical insurance will pay.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994, Applicant gave his then-girlfriend power of attorney over his affairs and bought a house they would live in as they planned to get married. Applicant 
deployed at sea for extended periods over the next year, but his girlfriend did not always pay the mortgage or other bills on time. He soon fell behind on his 
mortgage, utilities, car payments, and other obligations.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1995, Applicant sought protection from his creditors through Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He declared $21,426 in unsecured debt and $74, 451 in secured 
debt against $69,998 in assets. About $13,000 of the unsecured debt consisted of the deficiency balances owed after two of Applicant's cars were repossessed. 
Applicant agreed to pay $185 each month for 57 months, with the payment plan to end in March 2000. However, the bankruptcy was dismissed in July 1999 
after Applicant stopped paying into the plan sometime earlier that year (SOR &para; 1.a).<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In a signed, sworn statement given to the government in June 2003, 
Applicant claimed the bankruptcy action was satisfied in January 1999.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his girlfriend stayed together through at least 1998. As a result, he continued to accrue debts while he was paying off his bankruptcy plan, and 
still owes some of the debts declared in his bankruptcy petition. Included among those debts is a March 1995 judgment for unpaid rent totaling $550 plus costs 
and interest (SOR &para; 1.b). This debt was incurred when Applicant co-signed a lease for an apartment for his girlfriend after she separated from her husband. She 
did not pay rent on time and the resulting debt was assigned to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another debt left over from the bankruptcy dismissal was for $609 owed to an electronics store (SOR &para; 1.l). This debt has actually grown to more than $1,300 
due to accrued interest. The collection agency handling this account offered to settle for $559 in April, 2005. Applicant sent $35 four days after the hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued 18 additional delinquencies after he filed bankruptcy. These debts totaled approximately $17,964 (SOR &para;&para; 1.c - 1.k, 1.m - 1.u). One debt 
arose when Applicant continued to accept and spend approximately $3,663 in unemployment compensation payments even after he went to work for his current 
employer in May 2000. This debt was placed with a collection agency in October 2001 and remains unsatisfied (SOR &para; 1.o). Another debt arose when 
Applicant claimed his girlfriend's three children on his tax return in 1997. He then obtained an advance on the tax refund he thought he would get. It is unclear 
if the claimed deductions were allowed, but Applicant did not repay the company that advanced him the funds, and still owes approximately $694 (SOR &para; 1.j). 
Applicant also failed to pay an account with the Navy exchange totaling about $800. This debt appears to have been satisfied in March 2002 through attachment 
of Applicant's tax returns (SOR &para; 1.u).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Eight of Applicant's outstanding debts totaling about $2,000 have been placed with collection agencies and date back as far as September 1996 (SOR &para;&para; 1.g, 
1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t). One week before his hearing, Applicant paid off four of these accounts (SOR &para;&para; 1.m, 1,q, 1.r, and 1.t) totaling approximately 
$520.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since May 1996, there have been four other judgments representing delinquencies totaling approximately $7,515 entered against Applicant (SOR &para;&para; 1.e, 1.h, 
1.p, and 1.s). Applicant paid one off for $82 on September 16, 2005.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Another judgment for $4,853 has been satisfied since at least January 2005.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant 
claims one of the unpaid judgments (SOR &para; 1.e) is his ex-girlfriend's responsibility because she bought the furniture in question using his power of attorney 
after they had broken up. He further claims the debt was resolved when she filed her own bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> A judgment for nearly $2,000 on an unpaid loan 
originally made for $400 was entered against Applicant in April 2003 (SOR &para; 1.s), and remains unpaid. At or after the hearing, Applicant either made a partial 
payment to or established a payment plan with his remaining creditors.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed about his finances and other issues by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent on June 26, 2003. He submitted a written statement in 
connection with that interview, which included a personal financial statement (PFS) reflecting his income, expenses, assets, and net cash flow. The PFS showed 
Applicant had about $975 left over each month after expenses (SOR 1.v). Applicant denies he has had this much positive cash flow because he now pays child 
support and other bills.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> However, Applicant declared his monthly child support and other obligations in the PFS, and has not presented new evidence of 
regular monthly payments or other change of circumstances to support his denial.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, the house Applicant had bought for his planned marriage burned down, and he was indicted for arson, a felony. He was taken into custody, 
fingerprinted, and briefly jailed. He later appeared at a trial on this charge. After the prosecution presented its evidence, Applicant's counsel successfully moved 
to strike the prosecution's evidence and the case was dismissed.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on October 19, 2000. In response to question 21, which asked if he had ever been "charged with or 
convicted of any felony offense," he answered "no." He has denied any intent to falsify his answer, claiming instead he thought he need not disclose his 1998 
felony arson charge because it was dismissed at trial. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to question 37, which asked if Applicant had any unpaid judgments at the time, Applicant answered "no" (SOR &para; 2.a). Three of the four judgments 
Applicant has owed were in place when he filled out his SF 86. He asserts one of the judgment was his ex-girlfriend's responsibility, but has not accounted for 
why the other two - one to a municipality (SOR &para; 1.p) and one for unpaid rent (SOR &para; 1.b) - were not listed. Applicant also answered "no" to questions 38 and 
39, which asked if Applicant had ever been 180 days or was currently 90 days past due on any debts, respectively (SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c). He submitted his 
negative responses at a time when he had numerous delinquent debts, some in the form of collections and unpaid judgments.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, 
specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial 
of access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are 
Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F (financial considerations).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government 
based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability 
and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline F is that someone who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may 
be at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Additionally, how one manages his personal finances is also indicative 
of one's overall judgment and reliability. Here, the government's concerns about Applicant's suitability to hold a clearance are based on his record of 
delinquent debts since 1995 totaling at least $19,000, which arose after he filed for bankruptcy protection from over $95,000 in debts accrued before 1995. The 
government has presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations regarding Applicant's finances. The facts established, in turn, support a case 
against continuing Applicant's access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been in financial difficulty for nearly 10 years. Until the week preceding the  hearing, he had taken little action on his own to resolve any of his 
delinquent debts despite having the resources to do so. His history of excessive indebtedness is the result of poor financial decision making. Also noteworthy 
are at least two instances of dishonest financial dealings - his receipt of unemployment benefits to which he was not entitled, and his improper claim of his 
girlfriend's children as his own to get tax deductions to which he was not entitled. Based on the foregoing, Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1,<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 
2,<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, of the Guideline F mitigating conditions (MC), only MC 3<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has any application here. Applicant's initial financial problems arose when his ex-girlfriend abused her power of attorney and failed to pay his obligations while he was away on deployment. Further, Applicant's use of the federal bankruptcy 
laws was reasonable at the time. Had he been able to resolve those debts through his bankruptcy petition, and restored his finances to a reasonable state, there 
might not be a current security concern about his finances. However, his failure to complete the payment plan and his continued generation of delinquent debts 
vitiates the weight of MC 3 here. Although he has paid some of the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has not demonstrated he has changed the way he 
handles his finances. On balance, I conclude Guideline F against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears he deliberately omitted from his SF 86 facts about his arrest 
record (SOR &para; 2.a) and his financial difficulties (SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the allegation in SOR &para; 2.a, Applicant claims he answered "no" to question 21 and did not disclose his felony arson arrest because the charge was 
ultimately dismissed. In deciding if Applicant intentionally falsified his answer to question 21, his interpretation of the question is relevant. Had Applicant been 
arrested and released without being charged, or if the charge was dropped before any trial, or if the charge was made but later reduced to a misdemeanor his 
explanation might be acceptable. Such circumstances might support a claim that Applicant misunderstood what he was obliged to disclose. Here, however, the 
Applicant was indicted, arrested, fingerprinted, photographed, and jailed. He later appeared at trial on the same charge for which he was indicted. Not until the 
prosecution had rested its case at a trial with Applicant present was the charge dismissed. The issue here is not whether Applicant actually committed the crime 
for which he was indicted, but whether he was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"charged with or convicted of any felony offense." The answer to the question was clearly "yes" and not subject 
to other interpretation because Applicant may have misunderstood what had happened.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the allegation in SOR &para; 2.b, Applicant has not presented a plausible explanation for why he failed to list in question 37<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> any of the unpaid judgments in 
place against him at the time he filled out the SF 86. Even if one accepts his claim he thought one of them was his girlfriend's responsibility, that left two 
judgments that should have been listed. In response to SOR &para; 2.c,<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Applicant claims he did not list any debts as either 180 days or 90 days past due because he 
thought he was current on his debts at the time. In light of the totality of information showing Applicant has had numerous delinquent debts since at least 1996, 
this explanation is simply not credible. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all of the foregoing, Guideline E DC 2<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. Having reviewed the listed mitigating conditions under Guideline E, I find none is applicable. I have 
also considered that Applicant did disclose other financial difficulties in response to questions 33, 34, and 35. However, when considered along with the 
omission of his numerous unpaid debts totaling more than $19,000, and his omission of a felony arson indictment, I conclude Applicant was, at the very least, 
trying to minimize the extent of his financial problems. On balance, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-23221.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> of Applicant's lack of candor and his ongoing financial problems, taken in the context of all of the information before me 
shows that reasonable doubts persist about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I 
cannot conclude he has otherwise overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
