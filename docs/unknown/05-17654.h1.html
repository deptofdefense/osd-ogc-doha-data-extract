<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On August 1, 2006,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old mechanical engineer who has been employed by a defense contractor since 2000. He was born in the United States in 1970 to Thai parents who were attending school. 
They returned to Thailand in 1973 with their son where he grew up. He attended university in Thailand and graduated in 1992. Upon graduation he returned to the U.S. from 1992 to 1994 to further 
his education. He returned to Thailand in 1994 and worked for a private company. Applicant returned to the United States in 1995 to work on his Ph.D. From 1995 to 2000 he attended a university 
where he also taught. He has lived in the U.S. continually since 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant married his wife in 2001 in the U.S. She was also a student from Thailand attending school in the U.S. She is a citizen of Thailand and has a U.S. green card. She intends on applying for 
U.S. citizenship when she meets the appropriate time requirements. She is an environmental engineer who works for the local county government. She is pregnant with twins, the couple's first 
children.</P> 
 
<P>The parents and parents-in-laws of Applicant are all citizens and residents of Thailand. His parents are both retired university professors; his father an instructor in civil engineering and his mother a 
child psychologist. Neither works in their retirement. They own a home and other real estate in Thailand. Applicant and his wife have monthly contact with their parents, usually by telephone and 
occasionally by email. He and his wife visit their parents approximately once a year. He anticipates their visits will be more frequent once the children are born. His parents are planning a 2-3 month 
visit after the children are around six months old. He anticipates his mother-in-law will also visit once the children are born. His parents-in-law are separated so he is not sure if his father-in-law will 
visit. Applicant has one brother who is an architect and lives in Thailand. He also has college friends in Thailand that he keeps in contact with occasionally by email. </P> 
 
<P>In 2000, upon completion of his schooling and feeling a sense of emancipation, Applicant applied for, and received a Thai passport, through the Thai government. To obtain a Thai passport he had 
to show that his parents were Thai citizens. He traveled to Thailand from December 23, 2000 until January 1, 2001, December 21, 2001 until January 6, 2002, January 1, 2003 until January 12, 
2003, November 15, 2003 until November 30, 2003, and for a period of timel in 2005. He tries to visit once a year.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant renewed his Thai passport on November 10, 2003, and it expires on 
November 9, 2008. When traveling to Thailand, Applicant did not carry his Thai passport but traveled exclusively on his U.S. passport. He has not used his Thai passport for any foreign travel and 
claims he obtained it for cultural reasons and as a means of identification to show that he is also from Thailand.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He considers himself a dual citizen of the U.S. and Thailand.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is aware of the "Money Memo"<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and contacted the Thai consulate for guidance on returning his passport. He was advised that if he wanted to surrender his passport he had to do it in 
person. Applicant did not surrender his Thai passport and it remains in his possession. He has not taken the time to return the passport. Applicant is reluctantly willing to renounce his Thai 
citizenship if it is required for his job. However, he is not willing to renounce his Thai citizenship or return his passport if the job does not require him to do so. He does not want to do either, unless 
it is a condition of his employment. He does not plan on obtaining Thai passports for his children when they are born. He claims he considers the United States his citizenship, but Thailand his 
heritage.</P> 
 
<P>Thailand is a democratically governed constitutional monarch.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Thailand experiences ongoing terrorist insurgency in its southern regions.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In the area of human rights "the government  generally 
accepts the human rights of its citizens, however there were significant problems in some areas."<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The problems ranged from arbitrary and unlawful killings by both security force personnel and 
insurgents as well as deaths in police custody, torture and excessive use of force by police; arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without charge and widespread corruption.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant 
and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although 
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured 
against this policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The government has 
the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to 
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a 
security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline C-Foreign Preference is a security concern because when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interest in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual 
potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed 
in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guidelines C and B.</P> 
 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1 (<EM>The exercise of dual citizenship) </EM>and<EM> </EM>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport) 
</EM>apply. Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. At the age of 30 he applied for and received a Thai passport. He renewed the passport in 2003 which does not expire until 2008. He continues to  maintain 
the passport in his possession. The possession and/or use of a foreign passport is an exercise of dual citizenship. The above disqualifying conditions apply.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.1 (<EM>Dual citizenship is based solely on parents ' citizenship or 
birth in a foreign country,</EM> FP MC E2.A3.1.3.2<EM> (Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g. foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship) </EM>and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4 
(<EM>Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship),</EM>and conclude none apply. Applicant affirmatively applied for, received and renewed a passport from a foreign country. 
Although his parents are Thai citizens, Applicant was born in the U.S. and is a citizen. He obtained his Thai citizenship by his exclusive affirmative actions. Thus, both FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1 and FP 
C E2.A3.1.3.2 do not apply. Applicant's willingness to renounce his Thai citizenship is qualified. That is he would renounce it if necessary to retain his job, but he would prefer not to renounce 
and retain his Thai citizenship. I find Applicant's lack of commitment and willingness do not reach the necessary level to qualify for FP MC E2.A3.1.3.3 as he may likely retract his renunciation 
based on his job prospects. He also continues to possess an active Thai passport that does not expire until 2008. He would prefer to keep his passport as demonstrated by his failure to return it. In 
accordance with the "Money Memo" Applicant's retention of his Thai passport precludes him from obtaining a security clearance. I find under the above analysis he also has failed to mitigate the 
foreign preference concerns.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or 
obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country)</EM> and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2 (<EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential 
for adverse foreign influence or duress exists) </EM>apply. Applicant's wife lives with him in the U.S. and is a citizen of Thailand. She holds a U.S. green card and eventually intends on applying for U.S. 
citizenship when eligible. Applicant's parents and parents-in-law are immediate family members who all are citizens of and reside in Thailand. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has 
close ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> An immediate family includes spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
Applicant and his wife both keep in contact with their parents on a regular basis and it is likely to increase with the birth of their twin children. There is potential for foreign influence due to 
Applicant's family ties.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all of the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s) 
(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States)</EM> and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 (<EM>Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent), </EM>and I conclude they do not apply. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's family and in-laws are not agents of a foreign power since there was no information that they are engaged in intelligence work, but are retired or work in the private sector.<A HREF="05-17654.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The 
question remains whether the relatives are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family and in-laws verses the United 
States. The disqualifying condition requires that a foreign power would exploit its citizens or residents in such a way as to have Applicant act adversely to the interests of the United States. A factor 
to consider, while not determinative, is the character of the foreign power and entities within the foreign country. This review is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States. Friendly 
countries may have profound disagreements with the Unites States or have engaged in espionage against the United States especially in economic, scientific, military, and technical fields. A friendly 
relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in that country. Although the 
government of Thailand historically has had close ties with the U.S., it is still a country that has terrorist activities and factions. Its human rights record is a serious concern. Thus I find FI MC 
E2.A2.1.3.1 does not apply. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his wife maintain more than casual and infrequent contact with their parents. The contact is very likely to increase once their twin children are born. Obviously, Applicant has a live-in 
relationship with his wife who is a citizen of Thailand. He speaks with his parents regularly. Applicant's wife speaks regularly with her parents. Applicant and his wife's ties to their families are 
more than casual and infrequent. FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 does not apply.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's life to 
make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole 
person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding foreign preference and foreign influence. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the 
evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines C and B are decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
