<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thirty-eight-year-old Applicant had nine alleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR). </SPAN> One debt was a duplication.  She paid four small SOR debts on December 1, 2006.  The remaining

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 3, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), changing the reference from Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel 
Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended to DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not object to the amendment.  I granted Department Counsel's motion (Record of Hearing (R.) 14).   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant waived the fifteen day notice requirement<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> for her hearing (R. 13-14).  At her hearing on November 3, 2006, she requested that the record be held open so that she could submit 
additional documentary evidence.  I received additional documents, which I designated, Exhibit N (pages 2-5).  Department Counsel had no objection to my consideration of the additional evidence, 
and I admitted Exhibit N. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 16, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On June 5, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E 
(Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for 
occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on June 26, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  On October 13, 2006, the case was 
assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 3, 2006.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on November 28, 2006, and I received it on December 4, 2006.  I held the record open at 
Applicant's request, and received additional matters from Applicant on December 8, 2006.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she and/or her husband were responsible for most of the nine debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 38-years-old.  For the last ten years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor and is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has no prior 
military service.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She has completed two years of college with a 3.59 GPA, and has begun working towards a 4-year degree with an on line university.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She has applied for student loans to pay 
for her education.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>She was married on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 13, 1993.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Her first three children were not fathered by her husband (R. 24).  Their father sometimes fails to pay  child support (R. 24).  She and 
her husband separated several times, and then the separation became permanent in 2002.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  A family court order restrained her husband from visiting her family because he is a threat to them.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It 
also ordered him to pay $80 per week support, and noted that he had a cocaine problem.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  She is now a single parent with four children.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Her children were born in 1986, 1987, 1990, and 
1992.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Her husband does not provide financial support (R. 24).</P> 
 
<P>The debts in SOR  &para;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 1.a ($6,062) and 1.f ($4,269) are duplications.  The debt in SOR &para; 1.f is less most likely because it includes a credit for the repossession and sale of Applicant and her 
husband's car in 1999.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  They purchased the car in 1997, and made payments for two years of $313 per month.  Her husband refused to assist with payments, and she was unable to make the 
payments by herself.  The debt was transferred to the creditor in SOR &para; 1.f and she made payments of about $50 to $100 per month, but in 2000 she stopped making payments because she could not 
afford them. SOR &para; 1.f indicates it was placed for collection by a third creditor in February 2002.  Applicant accepted responsibility for the debt in SOR &para; 1.f. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debt in SOR &para; 1.b ($187) resulted from Applicant's purchase of a watch for $250 in the late 1990s.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Some payments were made, but then payments were stopped about 1999.  Applicant 
accepted responsibility for the debt in SOR &para; 1.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the medical debts in SOR &para;&para;  1.c ($93) and 1.g ($85),<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> both were paid by a money order for $128 on December 1, 2006.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  The medical debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.d ($67) and 1.i ($43) were 
also paid by a money order for $160 on December 1, 2006.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Some part of the delinquency on the medical debts resulted from unanswered question(s) pertaining to cost sharing or co-pays (R. 27-28). She was also unsure about the origin of several of these debts, but paid them anyway (R. 29-31).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the debt of $5,904 in SOR &para; 1.e, her husband purchased a used Ford Taurus in 2000, and she co-signed for the loan.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Applicant and her husband separated, and her husband kept the car (R. 
25).  The car had mechanical problems, which the dealership refused to remedy.  He did not make the payments, and the car was repossessed in April 2001 (R. 26).  The creditor contacted her on 
one occasion, and she informed the creditor that she was separated from her husband, and she suggested the creditor should contact her husband.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debt in SOR &para; 1.h ($272) was a loan Applicant's husband obtained from his employer, but Applicant co-signed for a line of credit.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  She thought that when her husband left his job that he had 
paid off the employer's loan, but later she learned he still owed his employer for this debt.  Applicant could not recall anything else about this debt.  SOR &para; 1.h indicates this debt was charged off in 
arch 2003 as a bad debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her interview of February 15, 2005, Applicant said that she did not intend to pay the joint debts because she believed they were her husband's responsibility, and she did not have the money 
anyway.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>   She was current on her non-SOR bills.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS), dated December 17, 2004, to a security investigator.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> In 2004, her gross salary was $2,126 per month, her net salary was $1,562 per 
month, and her expenses totaled $1,070 per month. She listed monthly household expenses as follows: lot rent ($140), groceries ($200), clothing ($0), utilities ($350), car expenses ($380), and 
miscellaneous ($0).  She listed the following debts: mortgage of $30,000 with a monthly payment of $430; credit card debt of $2,000 with a monthly payment of $138; an instant loan of $600 with a 
monthly payment of $81; and a financial services debt of $10,000 with a monthly payment of $300.  Her total monthly debt payment was $948.  After deducting all expenses she had a negative cash 
flow of $456 per month.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  The PFS lists real estate valued at $35,000 and a car valued at $11,000.  In an interview on February 15, 2005, and at her hearing, Applicant stated that her monthly 
expenses fluctuate, and when she needs more money she borrows from her father, her church and a friend.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She has received two raises after completing her 2004 PFS, but she did not indicate the 
size of the raises (R. 33). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her Pastor provided counseling and worked with her on setting up a budget (R. 35). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2006, Applicant joined a company that provides formal credit counseling.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her mortgage and car payments are current.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  For example, she borrowed $15,629 in 2003, and her car payment is $328 per month.  She has paid this debt down to $3,935.  She paid off non-SOR 
debts for $926 and $2,081 in August 2006 using money borrowed from her 401K account.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  She maintains a budget, and her payments are timely (R. 44-45).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 22b of her August 16, 2004, SF 85P asked, "Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal 
Government.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  She answered, "No" on Question 22b.  In her security interview on December 17, 2004, she said she answered, "No" because she "had no delinquent debts over 180 days that were 
Federal Guaranteed debts."<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  At her hearing on November 3, 2006, she indicated she misunderstood Question 22b's requirements stating, "Because when I read the question, I did not understand 
that to mean that any loans or outstanding loans from - on my credit reports.  I was just assuming that for</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">loans that I was paying at that time." ( R. 37).  She elaborated that she did not think she needed to list past debts in which she was not making any payments (R. 37-38). Department Counsel asked,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Why didn't you think that [not paying your debts] would be considered delinquency?"  She responded:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I really didn't think about that.  The only thing that I really questioned - in all honesty, I was not thinking about any past debts.  I was just thinking about current, even though I know it says 
delinquent.  But I was not thinking [about] anything that happened in the past or anything that I haven't paid from the past. R. 38. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully observed Applicant's demeanor as she answered the questions about falsification of her SF 85P.  Additionally, I have factored into my credibility determination the inconsistency of her 
explanation in her statement to the investigator, concerning why she answered, "No" to Question 22b.  Another important factor is she did not receive any contacts from creditors for a lengthy 
period of time,<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> and did not intend to pay the SOR creditors.  She answered "No" because she thought the government was seeking information about her "current" delinquent debts.  She mentally 
limited the question to those delinquent debts that she intended to pay, and to the debts that were not delinquent. At her hearing she responded in a forthright, candid manner to the best of her 
ability. She had difficulty understanding financial matters.  She often paused and seemed bewildered at the hearing. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> For example, Department Counsel was diligently attempting to obtain 
information about whether Applicant's income was sufficient to meet her current obligations.  After several delays and non-responsive answers, Department Counsel asked that the hearing be 
adjourned temporarily to permit  a friend who was sitting at Applicant's table to explain what was needed (R. 33-34).  Moreover her employer's earliest performance review notes, "Listen more 
closely to instructions for a clear understanding of directions and ask questions when unsure of clear direction to avoid repeating errors."<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  After considering all the record evidence, I find that she 
was truthful about her intent, and her answer on Question 22b of her SF 85P was an honest mistake, rather than a deliberate lie.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her Pastor's son stated he knew her for thirteen years and she is honest and trustworthy (R. 43 and Exhibit L).  He would help her financially when able to do so (R. 43).  Her Pastor describes her as 
selfless and trustworthy (Exhibit L).  Her employee evaluations reveal a hard-working, reliable, 10-year employee.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> Three friends (two are fellow employees) write that she is hard working, highly 
moral, honest and trustworthy.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER>In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory</CENTER> 
 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Regulation, Appendix 8, clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debt in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.f was a duplication of the same delinquent car loan.  The eight debts in SOR &para;&para;  1.b to 1.i 
were delinquent for a substantial period of time and are discussed briefly below.  </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her eight failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay her debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent for 
several years. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple (eight) delinquent SOR debts.  Payment of the four small debts so recently, well after she received the SOR, and shortly after her hearing 
is simply too recent to merit application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all eight SOR debts at issue because the debts became delinquent several years ago and were the result of her separation from her husband and his failure to financially 
support Applicant.  Her financial situation was aggravated by the failure of the father of her three children to consistently pay child support.  This change in family circumstances is a good example 
of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, causing financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's control."  I conclude that Applicant's statement about how her 
debts became delinquent is credible and sufficient to provide some credit under FC MC 3 in regard to her debts.  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she is still 
unable to pay all her debts, and waited until after her hearing to pay the four small SOR debts.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve her debts over the last 
several years.  However, her recent resolution of four SOR debts, keeping her mortgage and car payments current, and payment of two large non-SOR debts in August 2006 warrants some credit, 
which will be applied in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.  Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I am confident that she is on the 
right track now towards correction of her financial problems.  </P> 
 
<P>She receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there is sufficient evidence that she has will begin or has begun to receive financial counseling, and there are clear indications (since August 
2006) that the problem is being resolved or is under control. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>

<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-07550.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She has not provided sufficient information about 
how she attempted to resolve or repay her debts from 1999 until December 1, 2006.  She does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, for the application of the 3-year

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
38 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her separation from her husband and the failure of the father of three 
of her children to take financial responsibility for their familial obligations.  They made decisions not to use their money for Applicant and her family, or for paying the four currently delinquent 
SOR debts.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the complete absence of new delinquent debt over 
the last three years.  Moreover, increased income because of her educational accomplishments, her receipt of financial counseling, and her payment of six creditors in the last six months all show 
powerful signs of financial improvement in the future. </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her recent debts, most importantly, her mortgage 
and her car loan are current, and have not been significantly delinquent. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Changes resulting from counseling and greater awareness of financial responsibilities will result in a continuously 
improving trend of improved financial circumstances. Moreover, stability in her employment, increases in her income, and reduction in her debt load show improved self-discipline, and greater 
consciousness of her financial responsibilities.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006), the Board noted that two SOR debts were paid through judgment and garnishment, one SOR debt was paid through settlement, and one SOR 
debt was never paid.  Indeed, for one SOR debt the applicant did not even contact the creditor about payment.  Nevertheless, the applicant showed that he reduced his overall debt by 95% and the 
Board affirmed the decision to grant that applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial case is similar to ISCR Case No. 04-07360.  She paid four SOR debts.  One SOR debt is a duplication.  Four unpaid SOR debts remain, and her husband has the primary 
responsibility to pay the largest debt.  Her two most recent unpaid, delinquent debts are the debt charged off in March 2003 (SOR &para; 1.h), followed by the debt in April 2001 (SOR &para; 1.e).  Her four 
unpaid SOR debts are all barred by the South Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations.  As such, the concern about current financial pressure that may result in illegal activity is significantly lower 
because as a matter of law, she no longer has any delinquent debts.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude she has </SPAN>mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other 
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing 
that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a 
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
