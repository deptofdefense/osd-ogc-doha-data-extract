<P>Applicant's two alcohol-related domestic violence convictions since 1996, related falsification of an employment application in 1998, and failure to resolve a 
related past due debt cast significant doubt on Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, especially where he failed to provide any significant

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On 8 A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ugust 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a  Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-25630.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 25 
August 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 1 November 2002. The record in this case closed 20 December 2002--the day the response was due at DOHA. The case 
was assigned to me on 3 January 2003 and I received the case the same day to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 45-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks reinstatement of the clearance he held between approximately 1982 and 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol abuse, which has resulted in two convictions for domestic violence and created a kind of personal-life-cascade-failure. In 
ay 1996, Applicant and his girlfriend (who he later married) got into a fight when, after a day they both spent drinking, Applicant hit his girlfriend in the eye 
when she refused to fix him something to eat (Item 5).<A HREF="01-25630.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In July 1996, Applicant was convicted of domestic battery and ordered to complete a domestic violence 
class and perform 30 days community service. Applicant took four weeks off from his job to complete the community service all at once. Although Applicant 
states he advised his supervisor of the reason for his absence, he acknowledged that he did not submit any formal paperwork requesting the time off (Item 10). 
When he returned to work, he was fired for job abandonment from a job he had held since July 1981.<A HREF="01-25630.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Suddenly unemployed, Applicant cashed in his company 401k plan to meet his living expenses. The unanticipated tax consequences of that action caused 
Applicant to become indebted to the state and federal governments for the debts in subparagraphs 1.a. and b. He also fell behind in his payments on many 
accounts, including those at subparagraphs 1.c. and d. He was unemployed between approximately June 1996 and November 1997, when he obtained a job in 
his career field with a different employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In November 1998, he applied for a similar job with his current employer, but lied to them about his reasons for leaving his long-time employer in 1996 (Item 
9). He did, however, disclose the 1996 domestic violence offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On 12 March 2000, Applicant was again arrested for an alcohol-related domestic assault, when he and his now-spouse got into a fight after another day of 
drinking and choked her. He pled no lo contendere, was convicted on 3 July 2000, and sentenced to 3-years probation, 20 hours community service, and  fined. 
He was also required to complete a domestic violence program (Item 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  On 16 March 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(Item 4) on which he truthfully disclosed all the adverse information at 
issue in this case (firing, 1995 and 2000 domestic violence convictions, and a number of past due debts, including the ones alleged). He also disclosed a 1976 
drug arrest under the drug arrest question (#24) and his 1982 clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's 12 June 2001 sworn statement (Item 10) reflects that he has paid a number of debts that became past due while he was unemployed, and had 
entered into repayment plans with the state and federal governments for his tax liability. He claimed to have paid the debt at subparagraph 1.d. ($69.00, that he 
now admits). He had apparently not made any effort to repay the debt at subparagraph 1.c., despite a personal financial statement showing substantial positive 
monthly cash flow. He asserted that alcohol did not adversely effect his finances, but other than discussing the circumstances of the two domestic violence 
arrests, he did not provide any information on his alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Although Applicant disclosed the 1996 domestic violence arrest to his employer, he failed to 
disclose the true reason he left his long-time employer. He later truthfully disclosed all his adverse information to the government on his clearance application. 
While his falsification to his employer--clearly aimed at obtaining the job--is not, strictly speaking, a falsification of a government document within the 
disqualifying factors, it nevertheless retains security significance. In the industrial security program, the government must be able to rely on an individual's 
willingness to report adverse information about himself to his employer, who has an obligation to report it to the government, so the government may perform 
necessary damage assessments or re-evaluation of the individual's continued fitness for access to classified information. Although, Applicant disclosed all his 
adverse information to the government, Applicant's falsification of his employment application to get the job suggests he might keep any new adverse 
information from his employer, and thus the government. I find Guideline E. against Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness, which cannot be considered due 
to circumstances beyond his control, since Applicant's 1995 arrest was due to his misconduct, and his failure to formally request time off from his employer led 
to his termination for cause. Although Applicant's financial difficulties were clearly due to his unemployment--and his probably unwitting failure to account 
for the tax consequences of cashing in his 401K plan--between June 1996 and November 1997, Applicant's evidence fails to establish his financial difficulties 
are behind him. Applicant has entered into repayment plans with the two tax authorities and has apparently paid a number of past due debts long before his 
clearance processing. However, his failure to resolve the debt at subparagraph 1.c. despite having the apparent means to do so, or to explain his failure to act on 
this account, casts significant doubt on his financial responsibility. I resolve Guideline F. against Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.<A HREF="01-25630.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's two domestic violence incidents in were clearly alcohol-related, under circumstances 
that suggest Applicant either had to be intoxicated (legally if not physically) or so tolerant of alcohol as to be able to drink all day without much physical effect. 
Applicant has provided no evidence to demonstrate that his alcohol abuse has no security concern, or that he has taken steps to reduce or cease his alcohol 
consumption. I  resolve Guideline G. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's two domestic violence convictions since 1996 (and less than four years apart) are 
recent and serious. Applicant has provided no evidence to mitigate the security significance of these offenses. This misconduct casts doubt on Applicant's 
fitness for access to classified information. I find Guideline J. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
