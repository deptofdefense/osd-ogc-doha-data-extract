<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 29 August 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-33256.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 9 September 2003 and, on 2 October 2003, elected 
not to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On 18 January 2004, Applicant requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on 22 March 2004.  On 
15 April 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 23 April 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old administrative services manager for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1-2.  He served almost 24 years on active duty with the U.S. Air 
Force, retiring as a senior master sergeant (E-8) in 1996.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.  He married his first wife, a Thai national, in 1975 in Thailand, where he was stationed.  He 
has two children by his first wife., whom he divorced in 1997.  He married again in 2000.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>In 1975 and 1976, while on active duty stationed in Thailand, Applicant frequented massage parlors and paid prostitutes for sex "a couple of times a week."  
Ex. 3 at 4.  He was often accompanied on these visits to massage parlors by other members of his squadron.  Tr. 26-27.</P> 
 
<P>In 1990, Applicant's wife held a birthday celebration for her husband.  Applicant is an alcoholic and became intoxicated.  He walked into a room in his house 
where several children were playing.  He sat down on a couch with a 14-year-old girl and fondled her breast and put his hand up under her skirt.  Applicant was 
tried by a special court-martial for committing an indecent act with another.  Ex. 6 at 10.  He pled not guilty, but stipulated to the child's testimony.  He was 
found guilty and sentenced to confinement for 30 days, reduction in grade from E-8 to E-7, and ordered to forfeit $399 of his pay per month for three months.  
Ex. 8 at 2; Ex. 6 at 10.  After completing his term of confinement, Applicant was sent to a 28-day in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program, which he 
successfully completed.  Two years later, the Air Force Board of Correction of Military Records, as an act of clemency on behalf of the Secretary of the Air 
Force, promoted Applicant back to the grade of E-8.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not consumed alcoholic beverages since his 1990 birthday celebration.  In 1996, the Department of Defense investigated Applicant and granted 
him a top secret clearance.</P> 
 
<P>On 5 February 2001, Applicant was arrested for patronizing a prostitute.  An undercover officer saw a known prostitute flag down Applicant as he drove past in 
his car.  The officer followed them to a park.  Police officers approached the vehicle to talk to Applicant and the prostitute.  Applicant had to pull up his pants 
before he could exit the vehicle.  Applicant told the police officers that he was to pay the prostitute $25 for her to perform fellatio on him.  She claimed it was 
only $20.  Ex. 5 at 6.  The charge was eventually dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a signed, sworn statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent on 30 January 2002.  In it, Applicant admitted being arrested in April 
2001 for patronizing a prostitute.  But he claimed he had not solicited any prostitutes before or after the April 2001 arrest and had 'never been arrested, detained 
or questioned by any law enforcement authority, to include Air Force security police."  Ex. 2 at 3.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D-Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">paid prostitutes for sex twice a week from 1975-76 in Thailand (&para; 1.a.), committed an indecent act with a minor,<A HREF="02-33256.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of 
which he was convicted in a special court-martial in 1990 (&para; 1.b.), and was arrested for patronizing a prostitute in April 2001 (&para; 1.c.).  Sexual behavior is a 
security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or 
reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant denies that he was soliciting or 
patronizing a prostitute in 2001 when he was arrested.  He claims he gave a ride to a woman he did not know was a prostitute and the police arrested him after 
he left his vehicle to urinate.  He says he refused the offer of sex.  But the police report is explicit.  Applicant was stopped in his vehicle with his pants down 
and admitted he had agreed with the prostitute on the price of fellatio.  At the hearing, I listened carefully to his testimony and observed his demeanor.  I do not 
believe his version of the incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conviction for committing an indecent act and his arrest for patronizing a prostitute is sexual behavior of a criminal nature.  DC E2.A4.1.2.1.  The 
Government failed to establish that paying for sex in Thailand in 1975-76 was "of a criminal nature."  But Applicant admits that he was married in 1975.  
Paying for sex with prostitutes in Thailand while he was married, and patronizing the prostitute in 2001 while he was married to his second wife was sexual 
behavior that would cause him to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress (DC E2.A4.1.2.3) and reflects lack of discretion or judgment (E2.A4.1.2.4.).  
As Applicant is divorced from the wife to whom he was married in Thailand, and there appears to be no secret that he frequented prostitutes in Thailand as a 
young man, that behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  MC E2.A4.1.3.4.  Although the sexual behavior in Thailand was 
certainly not recent, it is relevant to Applicant's security worthiness because it is part of a pattern of sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion and 
judgment.  I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">falsified material facts in a signed, sworn statement by denying he had solicited prostitutes and had never been arrested, 
detained, or questioned by any law enforcement authority (&para; 2.a.).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant denied he had solicited prostitutes or ever been arrested, 
detained, or questioned by any law enforcement authority.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But in order to be a disqualifying condition under Guideline E, the denial must have been 
deliberately false or misleading.  <EM>See</EM> DC E2.A5.1.2.3.  Applicant claims he was not trying to mislead anyone.  He asserts he was only "asked about any 
incidents since [his] last security investigation."  <EM>See </EM>Answer.  The DSS agent testified that she placed no such limitation on her inquiry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After listening to his testimony and that of the DSS agent and closely observing their demeanors, Applicant failed to convince me that he was concerned only 
with incidents since his last periodic security review.<A HREF="02-33256.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  And his denial of ever soliciting a prostitute or being arrested, detained, or questioned by any law 
enforcement authority to so unequivocal, it does not support his claim.  I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant committed the criminal acts alleged in &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.c. (&para; 3.a.) and violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by falsifying his signed, 
sworn statement as alleged in &para; 2.a. (&para; 3.b.).  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant asserts he was not trying to mislead the DSS agent-he did not list the offenses because 
he was asked only about the offenses since the last investigation.  I did not find Applicant's explanation credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence the allegations in the SOR.  An applicant may be disqualified if allegations of criminal conduct are raised 
against him.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1.  None of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline apply to Applicant.  I find against applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P>
