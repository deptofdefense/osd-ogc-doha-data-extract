<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><EM></EM>Applicant (a 41-year old welder/brazier of a defense contractor) was convicted of a single cocaine distribution defense in 1987 (a felony) and later sentenced to 
eight years of incarceration, with all but three suspended.  He has successfully completed his probation, and has demonstrated reliable and trustworthy work 
performance for his defense contractor.  Applicant's conduct is covered by the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), which bars persons sentenced to more 
than one year of incarceration, regardless of time actually served, from ever holding a security clearance, absent a meritorious basis for an exception (not 
recommended here).  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 5, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on December 3, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 18, 2001, 
and was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on January 15, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant 
relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on January 24, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing , Applicant requested leave to supplement the record with character references.  There being no objection from Department 
Counsel, and for good cause shown, Applicant's request was granted.  Applicant was afforded seven (7) days to supplement the record; the Government was 
granted and additional two (2) days to respond.  With the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with six character references for inclusion in the 
record.   Department Counsel offered no objections, and Applicant's submissions are identified and accepted as Applicant's exhibit A.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year old welder/brazier for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance at the level of secret (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 42).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have been arrested and charged in November 1986 with distribution of cocaine (a felony), found guilty of the listed charge, fined 
$3,000.00, and sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the result of Applicant's alleged felony conviction and sentence to more than 365 days confinement, he is alleged to be <EM>per se </EM>disqualified<EM> </EM>from having a 
security clearance granted or renewed by the Department of Defense (DoD), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986, subject to any  authorized exception in a 
meritorious case by the Secretary of Defense ("SecDef").</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted being convicted as charged for distribution of cocaine (a felony) and pleading guilty to the offense on a plea 
bargain.  In elaborating on his punishment, he admitted to being fined $3,000.00 and sentenced to 8 years of incarceration, of which 5 was suspended and 3 
were ordered.  He admitted his security clearance is subject to denial pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986, absent an exception in a meritorious case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Appellant are incorporated by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1985, Applicant was visited by two police informants who were looking for marijuana.  Unaware the visitors were police informants, Applicant gave them 
marijuana belonging to his roommate.  Approximately a week later, police returned to his residence with a search warrant.  From police search of his residence, 
they found twenty ounces of marijuana in his constructive possession.  Finding the marijuana, they took Applicant into custody and returned to the local police 
station where he was charged with marijuana possession with the intent to distribute.  Initially, the charge was court-dismissed.  But three weeks later, 
Applicant was re-charged with the offense and this time plea bargained with prosecutors for a pleaded charge of constructive possession of marijuana.  For this 
pleaded offense, he was sentenced to ninety days in jail and an imposed fine of $500.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested again in 1986 on a drug-related charge: this time in connection with a putative "sting" operation, which produced a charge of cocaine 
distribution.  The police informant who confronted Applicant asked for some crack cocaine and accompanied Applicant to the source.  From the source, he 
purchased the crack cocaine, in the presence of the informant (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 34-35).  The cocaine was then passed from the source through Applicant to the 
informant.  Applicant, in turn, was arrested and taken into custody.  After pleading to distribution of cocaine and being sentenced to eight years of incarceration 
(five years suspended), Applicant was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of probation thereafter; he was also fined 3,000.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).  
He paid the fine and served 210 days of his sentence before being released early for good behavior (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 39-40).  Applicant has since successfully 
completed his three years of probation, learned from his drug-related experiences, and has since avoided any involvement with illegal substances (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4; 
R.T., at 39-40).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since being charged with his cocaine distribution offense, Applicant has had no further involvement with illegal substances and no confrontation with law 
enforcement authorities.  He is highly regarded by his colleagues and supervisors as an employee who can be trusted and has received commendations from 
Navy ship commands he supports for his work.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition to adjudicating Smith Amendment cases in accordance with current Executive Order and DoD Directive/Regulatory guidance, including applicable 
due process procedures, the criteria provide for consideration of issues covered by provisions 1 and 4 of the Act without consideration of the statute, this for the 
purpose of developing as complete a record as possible to aid the responsible authority for making a recommendation to the Sec Def as to whether the case 
merits a waiver.  The DoD regulations include revised Adjudicative Guidelines designed to implement the provisions of the Smith Amendment and supplement 
existing Adjudicative Guidelines</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which 
are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sense decision of security clearance eligibility.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  E2.2 considerations comprise the following: the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, the frequency and recency of the conduct, the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct, the voluntariness of 
participation, the presence or absence of rehabilitation, the motivation for the conduct, the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DoD's revised regulations are, in turn, reinforced by DOHA Operating Instruction 64, which all judges are required to follow in their implementation of Smith 
Amendment-covered cases.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy guidelines are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions (DC):</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC a  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC a  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC b  The crime was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC c  The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC f  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC g  <STRONG>Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of 
Defense or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with considerable praiseworthy work experience with his defense contractor over the past several years.  For his efforts 
and contributions to the defense industry, Applicant is to be roundly commended.  However, Applicant also brings a history of drug-related convictions, two in 
all between 1985 and 1986: a misdemeanor marijuana possession conviction in 1985 and a felony cocaine distribution conviction in 1987.  On his cocaine 
distribution conviction, he was sentenced to eight years of incarceration, with five suspended and three to serve, Besides his sentence, he was fined $3,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's cocaine distribution charge followed his being implicated by police informants in a sting operation.  His conviction was the result of a plea bargain, 
which he may not collaterally attack in these proceedings by any claims of entrapment (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).  Benefitting from a suspended sentence of all but three years  
of incarceration, Applicant served 210 days before being paroled for good behavior in 1987.  Credited with successfully completing his supervised probation, he 
has avoided any further involvement with illegal substances of any kind and shows excellent progress in the rehabilitative track he has pursued since his 
conviction over fifteen years ago.   By all accounts, he is doing well in his work and overall restoration efforts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By reliance on otherwise applicable mitigating conditions, Applicant's underlying actions leading to his 1987 conviction could be considered non-recent, even 
if not an isolated occurrence (given his previous marijuana possession conviction in 1985) when it happened, or the result of any visible pressure or coercion 
during the sting operation that actively enveloped Applicant.  Fifteen plus years and completed probation without any repeat involvement in illegal substances 
or confrontations with law enforcement provide good indicia of gained maturity and understanding of the seriousness of his drug-trafficking conviction and 
enable Applicant to invoke the mitigation benefits of supplemental condition MC b (non-recency) of the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, Applicant has compiled a praiseworthy work record with his defense contractor over the past several years.  For his efforts and contributions to 
the defense industry, Applicant is to be roundly commended.  Satisfaction of his supervised probation conditions, sustained aversion of any drug-related 
involvement since 1986 and overall work accomplishments certainly reflect favorably on his rehabilitation efforts and represent a strong recoupment of trust 
required to hold a security clearance.  With over fifteen years of seasoning, and successful probation to his credit, he absolves himself of most concerns about 
the durability of his rehabilitation under the supplemented Adjudication Guidelines and E2.2 considerations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But as the result of his state felony conviction, he was sentenced to a period of incarceration  exceeding a year, which brings his actions within the coverage of 
the mandatory provisions of the Smith Amendment's provision 1.  This much is true, even though the sentence was suspended by the court, and he has since 
completed the supervised phase of his court-ordered probation.  With its passage of the Smith Amendment, Congress manifest a statutory purpose for raising 
the level of critical scrutiny of persons with histories of serious criminal actions and corresponding sentencing time.  Marginal cases become less amenable to 
reconciliation of perceived security risks than under pre-Smith Amendment assessments.  By available adjudicative guidelines implementing the Smith 
Amendment, Applicant's restorative efforts are still insufficient to meet the mitigation threshold envisioned by 10 U.S. C. Sec. 986 to qualify for exception 
consideration.  On the strength of the Smith Amendment's mandatory lifetime disqualification of applicants whose conduct (like Applicant's) is found to be 
covered by the Smith Amendment's outlined provisions, risk absolving mitigation is not available to Applicant by virtue of MC g of the revised guidelines (no 
mitigation of potentially disqualifying conditions, except by demonstration of sufficiently meritorious circumstances to justify the granting of a waiver by the 
Sec Def). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Independent consideration of the mitigating guidelines developed for assessing a  provision 1 situation falling under the Smith Amendment does not warrant the 
availing of  mitigating conditions b(non-recency) and g (meritorious circumstances warranting exception consideration) covered by the corresponding 
supplemental mitigating conditions.  Because of the high priority placed by Congress on security risks associated with felony-type sentencing (<EM>viz., 
</EM>imprisonment over 365 days), waiver consideration of cases covered by provisions 1 an 4 of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986  is necessarily reserved only for cases that 
involve meritorious circumstances.  For the reasons cited above, this is not such a clear case of meritorious circumstances to warrant consideration of a waiver. 
Unfavorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.d on the strength of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986.  No  
consideration of exception relief afforded by the Amendment is recommended.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) of the 
Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the 
factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">GUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):   AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security 
clearance.  I do not recommend  further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986.</SPAN></P>
