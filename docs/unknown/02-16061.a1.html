  There is no right to a continuance and a party challenging the denial of a continuance has the burden of showing the Administrative Judge's denial was arbitrary or capricious.  In ruling on Applicant's request for a continuance, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge  to consider the fact that in December 2003 Applicant made a request for a hearing in his case, but did not try to retain an attorney to represent  him until he got a notice of hearing in August 2004.  It was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to state there was "some unexplained  reason" for Applicant's financial difficulties even though the Judge specifically identified two contributing factors for Applicant's financial  difficulties.  Given the record in this case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not presented  sufficient evidence to warrant application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 17, 2003, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).  Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated October 
14, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge abused his discretion in denying Applicant's request 
for a continuance of his hearing; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  
For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge abused his discretion in denying Applicant's request for a continuance of his hearing</SPAN>.  Applicant claims 
that the Administrative Judge abused his discretion by denying Applicant's request for a continuance in his hearing.  Applicant contends that 
as a result of the denial he was deprived of a fair hearing because his counsel was unavailable on the hearing date and Applicant had to settle 
for the assistance of a personal representative who "was neither an attorney nor familiar with the hearing process."  Applicant argues that the 
Judge sent notice of the August 19, 2004  hearing to Applicant on August 2, 2004, and this "did not provide sufficient time for Applicant or 
his attorney to coordinate their schedules."   Applicant contends that there was no support on the record for the Judge's conclusion that 
Applicant's "nine months of inaction since Applicant received the SOR" contributed to Applicant's lack of preparation for the hearing.  On 
the contrary, Applicant argues that it was the Hearing Office's failure to set a hearing date that caused the unavailability of Applicant's 
attorney.</P> 
 
<P>There is no right to a continuance<A HREF="02-16061.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and a party challenging the denial of a continuance has the burden of showing the Administrative Judge's 
denial was arbitrary or capricious.  The Board concludes that the Judge's denial of a continuance in this case is sustainable.  The SOR was 
issued in November 2003, and in December 2003 Applicant requested a hearing in his case.  Nevertheless, the attorney who he chose to 
represent him at the hearing stated in August 2004 that she could not attend the hearing, in part, because she was "just recently hired," and the 
Applicant admits in his brief that he did not retain counsel until he received the Notice of Hearing.  The Judge was justified in considering 
such things as how long Applicant had notice of the case (about nine months) and whether the Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to 
obtain counsel.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-03683 (August 9, 2002) at p. 4.  Nothing in the record indicates that Applicant was unable to 
hire counsel in the months between December 2003 and August 2004 to assist him in preparing for the hearing he asked for in December 
2003.  Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant had sufficient time to hire an 
attorney to represent him.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant generally does not dispute 
the findings of fact, but contends that the Administrative Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, capricious and against the weight of the record 
evidence because the record evidence "clearly establishes" that Applicant's disqualifying conduct was mitigated under Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3<A HREF="02-16061.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="02-16061.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge erred in stating that there was "some unexplained reason" for Applicant's 
financial difficulties<A HREF="02-16061.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> even though the Judge later identified two contributing factors for Applicant's financial difficulties.<A HREF="02-16061.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The Judge did 
not have to conclude that those contributing factors were extenuating or mitigating under the particular facts and circumstances of Applicant's 
case, but he could not have reasonably found that "Applicant's financial situation and difficulties . . . bring this matter within Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Condition[3]," while also finding that there is "some unexplained reason" for Applicant's difficulties.  However, 
because the Judge applied Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 3 in Applicant's favor, and for reasons explained hereafter in this 
decision, the Judge's error is not outcome determinative.</P> 
 
<P>The Judge distinguished between Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 3 and Financial Consideration Mitigating Condition 6.  The 
Judge was not convinced that Applicant had met his burden on Mitigating Condition 6.  The Judge found that Applicant continued to incur 
debts without making any effort to pay them off in a timely manner and was particularly troubled by Applicant's apparent failure to make any 
efforts to pay any creditor, with the exception of possibly two of them. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate his history of financial difficulties.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15. The Judge had to consider the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and decide 
whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's ability to argue for a more favorable 
weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 4.  It was 
not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to look at how Applicant handled all the debts over an extended period of time, rather than focusing 
in a piecemeal fashion on Applicant's conduct with respect to the largest debt.  Considering the record in this case, Applicant has not 
persuaded the Board that he presented evidence below that would require the Judge to apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 
in Applicant's favor.</P>
