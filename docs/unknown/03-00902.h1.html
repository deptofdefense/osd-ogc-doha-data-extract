<P>Applicant's history of criminal conduct beginning in 1987, and continuing until May 2002 has not been mitigated.  Applicant's numerous alcohol related 
incidents have also not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 20, 2003, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 9, to the Applicant on October 3, 2003.  The 
Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on October 25, 
2003, and he submitted a reply dated January 21, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on January 15, 2004. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 35 years old and unmarried.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a General Expediter, and is seeking to retain his security clearance in 
connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant admitted all of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  Between May 1987, and May 2002, the Applicant was arrested on at 
least eight separate occasions for various of the violations of the law.  </P> 
 
<P>On May 3,1987, he was arrested and charged with Malicious Wounding.  The Applicant explained that a twenty-five year old man grabbed his girlfriend (who 
later became his wife) twice between the legs.  The charge was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>On May 16, 1989, the Applicant was arrested and was charged with Trespassing.  The incident occurred as a result of a domestic argument between he and his 
wife.  The Applicant caught her with another man at her mother's apartment.  The Applicant was found guilty and was ordered to pay a fine of $100.00, court 
costs of $40.00, and restitution of $217.00.  The Applicant appealed, and was found guilty of Trespassing, sentenced to ten days in jail with sentence suspended 
and ordered to pay $217.00 restitution and $73.00 court costs.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 16, 1989, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault.  On appeal on September 11, 1989, the charge was entered Nolle Prosequi.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arraigned on September 11, 1989 on a charge of Summary Contempt.  He pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a $250.00 fine and $25.00 
in court costs.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested on June 6, 1992, and charged with Drunk in Public.  The charge was dismissed on June 22, 1992. </SPAN></P>

and required to submit to random breath and urine analysis.  He was ordered to attend an alcohol safety program and his driver's license was restricted to use 
for going to and from employment.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested six years later and charged with Driving Under the Influence on September 27, 2000.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six 
months in jail, with five months, twenty days suspended.  He was placed on twelve months probation.  He was ordered to complete 40 hours of community

safety program.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 7).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>He was arrested on January 13, 2002, and charged with Assault and Battery of a Family Member.  The Applicant explained that the incident occurred because, 
after fifteen years of marriage and two beautiful daughters, the Applicant caught his wife cheating with another man.  The charge was dismissed without 
prejudice on February 5, 2002.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 8).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He was arrested on May 16, 2002, and charged with Drunkenness and Simple Assault.  He was found guilty on May 17, 2002, and ordered to pay fines and 
costs of $67.00.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 9).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's alcohol related arrests set forth in allegations 1.(c)., 1.(f)., 1.(g)., and 1.(i)., were discussed above.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant states that he is now divorced from his wife and no longer consumes alcohol.  He has also established a relationship with Jesus Christ and has 
changed his life around.  The Applicant further states that he has learned from his mistakes.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 2).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>1.  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . ;</P> 
 
<P>4.  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct and alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J); and alcohol abuse 
(Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the 
Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under Guidelines J and G of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's long history of criminal conduct and excessive alcohol abuse between May 1987 and May 2002, involves eight separate arrests.  These arrests 
involved domestic disputes between he and his wife and/or alcohol abuse.  Given the Applicant's extensive pattern of poor judgment, occurring over a fifteen 
year period, sufficient rehabilitation and mitigation have not been shown.  The Applicant claims that he has learned from these mistakes and has changed his 
life around.  The evidence does show that the Applicant has not been arrested within the past two years.  He is commended for this progress, however, it is still 
too soon to determine that the Applicant will not return to his regular bad habits and commit a violation in the future.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More time is needed to demonstrate to 
the Government that the personality changes the Applicant has recently made are permanent.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  At the present time, the 
Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  </SPAN>Accordingly 
Guidelines J and G are found against the Applicant.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
