<P>Applicant's financial indebtedness remains current and he has not made a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  His intentional falsifications on his security 
clearance application have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 30, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 28, 2005, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of nine Government Exhibits referred to in the record as 
Government Exhibits 1 through 9, to the Applicant on June 17, 2005.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation 
within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on July 8, 2005, and he submitted no reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for decision on 
August 24, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the contents of the FORM.  The Applicant is forty-one years old.  He is 
employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Field Engineer and is seeking to obtain his security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(c), 1(d), 1(f), 1(h), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l), 1(m), 1(n), 1(o) and 1(r) of the SOR.  He denies the 
delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(e), 1(g), 1(i), 1(p), 1(q), 1(s), 1(t), and 1(u).  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Answer to the SOR).  With respect to the 
debts that he denies, the Applicant admits that they are all reflected on his credit reports, but either does not remember them or is uncertain as to whether he 
owes them.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Credit reports of the Applicant indicate that he is indebted to 21 different creditors, 16 of which are collection accounts, totaling an approximate amount of $ 
30,000.00.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibits 6, 7, 8 and 9).  Each of the debts remains outstanding and delinquent.  There is no evidence in the record that the 
Applicant has been paying any of the creditors.  There is no evidence that he has had any contact with his past due creditors and he is not disputing any of the 
debts with the credit reporting agencies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant asserts that a business failure resulted in his losing more than $50,000.00,  an investment that he was expected to be paid back by his partners, 
but was not.  As a result, he has not had sufficient monies to satisfy his financial obligations.  Between 2002 and 2003, the Applicant was also supporting two 
separate households on one income and had no surplus available to pay all of his bills.  The Applicant further asserts that his son had a chronic stomach 
disorder that caused the medical bills alleged in the SOR.  As a result, the Applicant's house was ultimately foreclosed upon and his bills went into collection.  
He states that he chose not to file bankruptcy but instead contacted a debt counselor and started a program of repayment in 2002.  There is no documentary 
evidence in the record showing any such payment program.  The Applicant contends that his business partners have now only partially paid him back.  The 
Applicant has had to result to litigation to obtain the money but has been unsuccessful.  He may make another attempt soon.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated January 29, 2003.  Question 38 of the application asked the Applicant if 
in the last seven years, has he ever been more over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 4).  This was a 
false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he was over 180 days delinquent on his debts set forth in allegations1(a) through 1(j) of the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9).     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire, at question 39, asked the Applicant, if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, "NO".  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 4).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he was over 90 days delinquent on his debts set forth in allegations 1(a) 
through 1(l) of the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9).      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that he did not have his credit report when he filled out the SF-86, implying that he was unaware of his numerous delinquent debts.  
(See Government Exhibit 2).  He later stated that his financial situation was in a "state of disarray", which would lead one to conclude that he knew about his 
financial indebtedness.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 5).  His credit reports show at least 16 debts that have been in collection, some dating as far back as 1998-1999.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant knew or should have known to reveal the truth about his delinquent financial history.  The fact that he conveniently has forgotten about 
these debts is no excuse.  I do not find any of the Applicant's excuses for not making some significant effort to resolve his delinquent debts to be credible.  
Accordingly, I find that the Applicant deliberately attempted to conceal this information from the Government on his security clearance application.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.        The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he has been untruthful 
on his security clearance application (Guideline E).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  
Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  With respect to his finances, the Applicant has in excess of $ 30,000.00 in delinquent debt.  It is noted that he was involved in a business 
venture that went bad, however, there is insufficient evidence in the record to explain why he is still unable to pay his bills.  There is also some evidence to the 
effect that the Applicant's son suffered a stomach illness that caused medical bills, but the evidence is not sufficient to explain why the Applicant has still not 
paid some of these bills.  I find all of the alleged debts to be valid and owing.  As to those debts that the Applicant has denied, he had not documented any 
payoffs or other steps that he has taken to resolve them.   He has presented no evidence to show that he has made or is making a good faith effort to pay off his 
past due creditors or resolve his financial indebtedness.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon review of his financial statement,  it appears that he now has some disposable income at the end of the month that he could use to pay his past due bills.  
However, he has failed to do so and has not explained how he will resolve them.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations </EM>and <EM>(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  None of 
the mitigating conditions (MC) apply.  His financial problems remain current (MC)1; they are not isolated, (MC) 2; and the Applicant has not initiated a good 
faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC) 3<EM>.</EM>  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, the Applicant has presented no reasonable excuse as to why he did not reveal his financial history in response to questions 38 and 
39 on his security clearance application.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no reasonable excuse for his failure to answer the 
questions truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been completely honest with the Government regarding his criminal history 
and he sought to conceal the truth.  Disqualifying Condition<EM> (2) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities </EM>applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are 
applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement 
of Reasons.     </SPAN></P>
