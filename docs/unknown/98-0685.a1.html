<P>Administrative Judge John R. Erck issued a decision, dated January 29, 1999, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 16, 1998 to Applicant. 
The SOR was based on Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he indicated
he would not request a hearing.  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.  A copy of the FORM was provided
to Applicant, who submitted a response to the FORM.  The case was then assigned to the Administrative Judge for
determination.</P>

<P>   The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's
appeal from that unfavorable decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG><A HREF="98-0685.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's factual findings concerning his conduct in August
1997 (when he threatened a cab driver with a shotgun in a dispute over cab fare) or his subsequent prosecution and
sentencing for that conduct.  However, Applicant asks the Board to reverse the Administrative Judge's adverse security
clearance decision.  In support of that request, Applicant makes several arguments: (1) the Administrative Judge should
have contacted Applicant and asked him for additional information to address those aspects of the case for which the
Judge felt there was an absence of evidence; (2) Applicant was candid with the government about his criminal conduct;
(3) Applicant's criminal conduct was isolated in nature and did not result in actual harm to the victim; (4) Applicant
regrets his criminal conduct and has learned a hard lesson from it; (5) Applicant's criminal conduct was unrelated to
Applicant's job or his job performance; (6) the Administrative Judge did not give sufficient weight to the mitigating
evidence that he acknowledged was present in Applicant's case, including the evidence of Applicant's rehabilitation; and
(7) the Administrative Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant's years of military service and his work for a
defense contractor.  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge acted properly by not contacting Applicant and asking him for additional information.  Given
the information in the FORM about Applicant's criminal conduct, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence to
"rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . ."  Directive,
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15.  Applicant had the opportunity to respond to the SOR and the FORM.  He used
those opportunities to respond to the SOR and present information for consideration by the Judge in his case.  The Judge
must act in a fair and impartial manner (Directive, Sections D.1.; Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 10).  In presenting
evidence for consideration by the Judge, each party bears the responsibility for presenting evidence that it wants the Judge
to consider.  If a party fails to present sufficient or convincing evidence, that party cannot expect the Judge to act as a
surrogate advocate and help that party develop or bolster its case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DISCR Case No. 90-1931 (January 17, 1992)
at p. 6 (Administrative Judge not required to call witnesses for either side; Judge's impartiality could be questioned if
Judge called witnesses without being asked to do so by either side); DISCR Case No. 90-0473 (August 14, 1991) at p. 2
(even <EM>pro se</EM> applicant is obligated to take reasonable steps to protect his own interests).  It is not reasonable for Applicant
to contend the Judge should have helped him satisfy his burden of proof under Item 15 of the Additional Procedural
Guidance.</P>

<P>Applicant's candor about his criminal conduct did not preclude an adverse decision in his case.  An applicant's candor and
honesty about his or her conduct does not immunize that conduct from consideration for its security significance. <EM>See,
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0370 (January 28, 1999) at p. 3.  Nor does an applicant's candor change the intrinsic nature of the
admitted misconduct.  Accordingly, Applicant's candor did not require the Judge to rule in Applicant's favor.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge has the primary responsibility for weighing the record evidence and making findings of fact.  In
doing that, the Judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the
unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0370 (January 28, 1999) at p. 3.  Absent a showing that
the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the Board will not disturb the Judge's
weighing of the evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 29, 1999) at p. 3.  In this case, the Judge's findings
about Applicant's criminal conduct reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Therefore,
Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge
erred.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0445 (April 2, 1999) at p. 2.  Furthermore, nothing in Applicant's appeal or the record
below persuades the Board that the Judge weighed the record evidence in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</P>

<P>An applicant's security eligibility is not limited to consideration of the applicant's job performance or conduct during duty
hours.  Any off-duty conduct that has security implications can be considered in deciding an applicant's security
suitability.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0440 (November 23, 1998) at p. 5.  Accordingly, neither Applicant's past military
service nor his job performance with a defense contractor preclude an adverse decision based on his criminal conduct in
August 1997 that has negative security implications.</P>

<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to
classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States,</EM> 444 U.S. 508, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security requirements include
consideration of a person's judgment, reliability, and  trustworthiness.  <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473
v. McElroy</EM>, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  The government need not wait until an
applicant fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke that applicant's access to
such information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  All that is
necessary is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or
that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons
given access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0445 (April 2, 1999) at p. 3.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's use of a shotgun to threat a cab driver over a fare dispute was
isolated, but serious, misconduct that raised doubts about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  The Judge also
concluded that Applicant's criminal conduct was not sufficiently mitigated by the evidence of Applicant's acceptance of
responsibility for his criminal misconduct, his remorse, and his desire to distance himself from the August 1997 incident. 
Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's conclusions are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> In addition to an appeal brief, Applicant submitted a letter from his wife.  Making allowances for Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM>
status, the Board will construe the letter from Applicant's wife as part of Applicant's appeal brief.  Applicant's brief and
his wife's letter contain some factual assertions that go beyond the record evidence.  Because the Board cannot consider
new evidence on appeal (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 29), the Board will not consider those portions
of the appeal submissions.</P>
