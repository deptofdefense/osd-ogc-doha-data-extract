<P>Applicant's personal conduct involving fraudulent activity resulting in his termination from employment in July 2000, has not been mitigated by sufficient 
evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2,1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 20, 2003, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.   
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on November 10, 2003.  The Applicant was instructed to 
submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on November 25, 2003, and he submitted a 
reply to the FORM that is undated.  </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on January 23, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 29 years old and has a Bachelor's Degree.  He is employed as a Security Guard by a defense contractor.  He is applying for a security clearance 
in connection with his employment.</P> 
 
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered</P> 
 
<P>as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his conduct involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was terminated from his employment with a department store in July 2000, due to fraudulent activity.  The Applicant, while employed as a loss-control supervisor, allowed non-employee friends to purchase merchandise using his store discount.  The Applicant instructed the cashier that it was acceptable 
to give the Applicant's friends his employee discount.  The Applicant then signed the receipts as the customers left the store.  The Applicant was not prosecuted 
for the criminal offense.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Item 5).   </P> 
 
<P>As the loss-control supervisor of the department store the Applicant's duties, among other things, required him to prevent this type of fraud. The Applicant 
acted against store policy and in direct opposition to his duties.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant realizes that this was a horrible mistake.  He states that he will never again instruct anyone to act against company policy.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government 
Item 3, and Applicant's Response to FORM).     </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are</P> 
 
<P>found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>4.  Personal Conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.</P> 
 
<P>5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violations of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general</P> 
 
<P>factors:</P> 
 
<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and</P> 
 
<P>conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order</P> 
 
<P>10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request</P> 
 
<P>for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period</P> 
 
<P>of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. </P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the 
careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past</P> 
 
<P>and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or 
conclusions that have reasonable and logical</P> 
 
<P>basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence</P> 
 
<P>which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms</P> 
 
<P>of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per</P> 
 
<P>day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be 
involved in personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or blackmail.  This personal 
conduct demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</P> 
 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding</P> 
 
<P>of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a</P> 
 
<P>security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go</P> 
 
<P>forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the 
ultimate burden of persuasion in proving</P> 
 
<P>that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has engaged in personal conduct or concealment of information that 
increases his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or 
connection with his security clearance eligibility.</P> 
 
<P>Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has failed to introduce persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome 
the Government's case.</P> 
 
<P>The evidence shows that the Applicant was terminated from his past employment for fraudulent activity.  (Guideline E).  The Applicant acted directly in 
opposition to his duties as loss prevention supervisor, responsibilities that he was entrusted with by his employer.  There is insufficient evidence in the record to 
support the fact that the Applicant has sufficiently rehabilitated himself since July 2000, when he was terminated.  The Applicant's personal conduct shows a 
pattern of dishonesty and rule violations, which is entirely unacceptable conduct.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  As a result, the Applicant poses a 
potential security risk and cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  Accordingly, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is found against the Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>    Subpara.  1.a.: Against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent</P> 
 
<P>with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
