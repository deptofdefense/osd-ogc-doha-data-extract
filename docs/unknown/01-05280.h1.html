<P>On August 12, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be 
denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 12, 2001, (notarized on September 14, 2001) in which he elected to have the case 
determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the 
Applicant on September 28, 2001.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on October 15, 2001, and he submitted no reply.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on November 15, 2001. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 25 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Mail Sorter, and is applying for a security clearance in connection 
with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the attached Statement 
of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated October 12, 1999.  In response to question 20, which 
asked, "Has any of the following happened to you in the last ten years? - Fired from job, - Quit a job after being told you'd be fired-left a job by 
mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance - Left a 
job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances", the Applicant answered "NO."  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 4,Question 20).  This was a 
false answer.  The Applicant was terminated from his job in April 1998, after testing positive for marijuana.  (Government Exhibit 5).  The 
Applicant admitted that he when he applied for employment with his company he failed to disclose this information because he did not want it to 
hinder his employment eligibility.  The Applicant further admits that he deliberately falsified his security clearance application by failing to admit that 
he had lost his previous employment because he failed a drug test.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Answer to SOR dated September 12, 2001).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire asked the Applicant if since the age of sixteen or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, has he illegally used any 
controlled substance.  The Applicant answered "NO."  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 4, Question 27).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant had 
used marijuana three or four times in 1998.  (Government Exhibit 5).  The Applicant admits that he deliberately falsified his security clearance 
application by failing to admit his marijuana use in 1998.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Answer to SOR dated September 12, 2001).  The Applicant stated 
that since April 1998, he has not used any illegal drugs, and he has no intentions of ever using illegal drugs in the future.          </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant's responses to questions 20 and 27 on his security clearance application of October 12, 1999, were a deliberate attempt 
to conceal material information from the Government.  The information provided by the Applicant was false, and the Applicant knew that it was 
false at the time he provided it on the application.    <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record does not contain sufficient evidence in mitigation to overcome or outweigh the negative effects of the Applicant's false statements to 
DoD which were provided under a certification of truth or a sworn oath.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or statute, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative 
Judge should consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate 
question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's 
request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination 
that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel 
security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The 
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge 
cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President 
Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such 
sensitive information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available 
information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of dishonesty  which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the 
Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant 
to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The 
Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has deliberately and intentionally falsified material facts in his 
security clearance application (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the 
Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance 
eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to 
overcome the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application by concealing the fact that he was terminated from a previous employer for 
failing a drug test, and that he used marijuana several times in 1998.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Not only did he conceal this information from the Government, but he 
concealed it from his employer in order to be eligible for employment.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance 
holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material 
aspects of his or her personal background.  This Applicant cannot be considered trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for 
access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
