<P>The Applicant has a history of past due indebtedness which she has not yet resolved.  Insufficient evidence was shown that the Applicant has made current

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 19, 2004, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The Department Counsel 
submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on July 9, 2004.  The Applicant was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any 
additional information to the Administrative Judge.  The Applicant acknowledged receipt the FORM on July 15, 2004, and elected to submit additional 
information, which was not objected to by Department Counsel.  The case was received by the undersigned for Decision on October 13, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 49 and single.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a logistics specialist, and she seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection 
with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is 
financially overextended and that this conduct shows poor judgment and/or leaves her at risk of having to use illegal means to generate funds.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant admits owing $2,343.00 for a delinquent student loan.  In her responses, the Applicant indicates that this debt may be the same as in 
subparagraph 1.b.   The Applicant submitted documentation showing that she had made a payment arrangement with a predecessor creditor in 2003.  
(Government Exhibit 6 at 12.)  However, there is no evidence as to the current status of this debt and the most recent credit reports still show it past due and 
owing.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant admits owing $4,596.00 for a delinquent student loan.  In her responses, the Applicant indicates that this debt may be the same as in 
subparagraph 1.a.   The Applicant submitted documentation showing that she had made a payment arrangement with a predecessor creditor in 2003.  
(Government Exhibit 6 at 12.)  However, there is no evidence as to the current status of this debt and the most recent credit reports still show it due and owing.  
(Government Exhibit 8 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant admits owing $367.00 for this delinquent account.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has made any payments on this account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant admits owing $2,200.00 for a delinquent account with a department store.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has made any payments 
on this account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant admits owing $1,031.00 for a delinquent credit card account.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has made any payments on this 
account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant admits owing $1,124.00 for this delinquent account with a second department store.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has made any 
payments on this account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted a statement in her response to the FORM dated August 16, 2004, concerning her debt situation.  She says, "In the past two to three 
years my credit has improved and I have been paying my accounts that were delinquent at the time."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally 
falsified material aspects of her personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 27, 2001, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which she stated that she had only one account that was over 180 days delinquent.  
(Government Exhibit 4, question 38.)  In fact, at that time, the Applicant was also over 180 days delinquent with her student loans, set forth in subparagraphs 
1.a. and 1.b., above.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant states that it was not her intention to falsify her questionnaire.  Rather, "At that time [when the questionnaire was 
filled out] I was not aware those bills in question were in default due to the fact in 1998 I had moved back to the state of . . . and I was unemployed for a short 
period of time.  During my unemployment I contacted my creditors and I had informed them of my current situation."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of financial mismanagement and falsification of government documents that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness 
or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has many unpaid, past due debts (Guideline F); and 
that she made false statements on a security questionnaire (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against her, except in part.  Regarding Paragraph 2, based on the available record, I find that there is insufficient evidence to show that the 
Applicant's failure to list her past due student loans was intentional as opposed to inadvertent.  Accordingly, the Government has failed to prove this allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a long "history of not meeting financial obligations."  (Disqualifying Condition 1.)  In addition, based on the available record, she is unable 
or unwilling to satisfy those debts.  (Disqualifying Condition 3.)  It is the Applicant's burden to show that she has made some actual effort to pay her debts or 
otherwise resolve her financial difficulties, as is required by Mitigating Condition 6.  She has failed to do so, other than by making vague promises.  That is 
insufficient.  If she is able to provide concrete evidence that she has her financial affairs in order she may be eligible for a security clearance in the future.  She 
is not now.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  
As set forth above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
