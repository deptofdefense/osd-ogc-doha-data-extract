  Applicant with praiseworthy military and civilian record was involved in several incidents over a seven-year period that raise questions about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness: use of bogus parking passes on two occasions and failure to consistently account for work ours over an 8-week period  in 2000.  Applicant mitigates parking pass and mischarging of time by a combination of non-recency (as to parking passes), unsubstantiation as to most of the  mischarging of time problems, and overall demonstration of restoration of judgment and trust for the mistakes he made in the past.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has maintained a generally praiseworthy civilian career with his employer of over 30 years.  Contrasted against this meritorious performance record is 
a series of actions reflecting judgment lapses.  Two involved misuse of company parking passes between 1993 and 1995, for which he received a company 
reprimand for the second incident.  The most serious allegations made against Applicant involved his investigated actions about violating company work 
accountability policy, for which he was disciplined and suspended for three days without pay.  These allegations are for the most part unsubstantiated upon 
further review of the proofs provided by Applicant.  Judgment lapses associated with the covered incidents are unsubstantiated in part, isolated and mitigated by 
the passage of time without further incident.  Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 10, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 5, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2003, and was scheduled for 
hearing on December 18, 2003.  A hearing was convened on December 18, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 5 exhibits; Applicant relied 
on three witnesses (including himself) and 10 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on January 2, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) attempted to use a bogus parking pass at his workplace in March 1995, (b) been caught with a counterfeit 
parking pass at his workplace in April 1998, for which he was given a reprimand and a 3-day suspension, and (c) received disciplinary action from his employer 
(two weeks off of work without pay) in July 2000 as the result of his being found to have violated company charging policy between January and February 
2000. </P> 
 
<P>For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, but denied he violated company charging policy for which disciplinary action was taken 
against him by his employer.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old senior engineering specialist for a defense contractor who seeks to retain a security clearance he has held since 1982.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations 
covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings 
follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his military service which included a tour of duty in Vietnam where he served as an assistant platoon leader over a helicopter medivac evacuation 
command, Applicant joined his current employer (in 1973).  Upon his joining a subsidiary of his current company in 1973, he was assigned responsibility for 
developing a training center for training Iranian pilots.  Applicant spent about nine years working for this subsidiary before transferring to the parent (in 1982).  
With his current employer he has concentrated on projects with his electronics warfare group.  As a project engineer with this group he has consistently required 
a clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1995, Applicant was caught using a bogus parking pass at his work place.  As a pilot he had always had a parking pass and continued using it after he 
was transferred to his company's engineering staff.  The pass he possessed didn't permit parking in the particular lot he was used to parking in.  So, he 
unilaterally assigned a phony permit number to it (using the old sequence of numbers used) and continued using his old pass (<EM>compare </EM>ex. 5 with R.T., at 69, 
122-23).  Applicant's recollection of his using his old expired pilot's pass confuses and mistakes similar  actions in 1998.  One morning as he was attempting to 
use the pass to enter the same parking lot he had continuously frequented, the parking guard confiscated it (R.T., at 69-70).  No disciplinary action was taken 
against Applicant as the result of his continued use of the unsuitable parking pass.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1998, Applicant was caught with a counterfeit parking pass at his workplace.  He  used a version of the same altered pass that was confiscated from 
him in 1995 to attempt to gain entrance to the lot outside his door (R.T., at 70-71).  The same guard checking his parking pass in the past checked the 
counterfeit parking pass Applicant was attempting to use to enter a restricted parking lot.  Applicant was impressed at the time with secretaries being able to 
park in this restricted lot, and figured he was just as entitled.  When confronted by the guard he freely admitted his use of a counterfeit pass to gain entry to the 
restricted parking lot.  Previously, he had never told his security manager he had made up a phony parking pass (R.T., at 123).  Applicant was subsequently 
given a reprimand by his company, as well as a 3-day suspension without pay.  Since accepting this reprimand, Applicant has never again tried to park in his 
company's executive parking lot.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1995 and 1998, Applicant regularly received merit raises and promotions.  Company time criteria emphasized the 40-hour work week.  A company 
investigation was initiated against Applicant around July 2000, however, based on reports from another employee that he had mischarged his time from January 
2000 through February 2000.  According to a July 2000 security memo from his employer's security manager, Applicant and a colleague (Ms. A) overstated the 
hours they worked for the January 3 to February 28, 2000 period based on checked labor screens of Applicant's gate swipes with his badge, labor reports for the 
period, and failure to list any  hours for the week of February 14 to account for a business trip he took with Ms. A (<EM>see </EM>ex. 3).  In his interview with 
investigators, Applicant disputed suggestions he mischarged his labor hours and assured that he often worked more than the 40-hour work week.  He also 
assured he had put in enough time during this time period under review to more than cover for any unaccounted for absences.  He took issue with turnstile 
reports reflecting delayed returns on offsite trips and trips to other plants in the facility: He attributed discrepancies to his failures to wand in on his returns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After comparing their few known inconsistencies with non-recorded turnstile data and comments from Applicant and others covering the eight weeks under 
investigation, the company's investigation team could not conclude with any degree of accuracy how many hours either Applicant or Ms. A mischarged.  
However, the investigating team did note unaccounted absences from their facilities and recommended additional training for both Applicant and Ms. A on the 
subject of labor charging and the ramifications to them of improper charges.  The investigating team also recommended further review of their investigation 
results (<EM>see </EM>ex. 3).  Each of these recommendations were made without any tangible evidence in the record of affording Applicant the opportunity to confront 
the evidence gathered by the investigating team and respond to them appropriately.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of the company's investigative findings both Ms. A and Applicant received disciplinary action for violating company labor charging procedures.  
Applicant's disciplinary action consisted of two weeks off work without pay.  Unlike Applicant, Ms. A (who since left the company's employ and married 
Applicant in November 2000) was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate she worked at least 40 hours per week during the period of January and February 
2000 (<EM>see </EM>ex. I).  Some of the work she normally would do at the office she  performed at home where she would experience fewer disruptions.  Her supervisor 
credited her with working the required number of hours during the period in question.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After being notified of his disciplinary action and ensuing suspension, Applicant gathered up information that he believed would exonerate him, but was denied 
any opportunity to refute the drawn conclusions of the company's investigating team (<EM>compare </EM>exs. E through H with R.T., at 74-75).  His September 2000 e-mail to his company supervisor outlining his points in defense was never responded to (<EM>see </EM>exs. 2 and J; R.T., at 105).  His records, though, do support at least 
his questioned business trip on February 14 showing a hotel that matches the one in the company report, only by a different name (R.T., at 83-84).  Other 
records produced by Applicant reflect his appearance at outside sites during the period in question; while others appear to cover the hourly gaps in work hours 
produced by the company investigation.  The company's investigation report contains no verification data to document the company's investigators ever tried to 
verify Applicant's claimed offsite time.  Company investigators appeared to have placed most of their drawn conclusions on the computer generated turnstile 
record (ex. H), which did not reflect the spread sheet data developed by Applicant three months later (<EM>compare </EM>exs. G and H with R.T., at 89-94).   Applicant 
assures that never on any of the days questioned did he materially  mischarge time.  While there were days when he charged 8 hours for 9 and 9 hours for 8, he 
always tallied at least 40 hours in each of the weeks reviewed (<EM>see</EM> exs. G, H and J; R.T., at 95, 105-06).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From the testimony and documentary support supplied by Applicant, he persuades that he, too, worked at least 40 hours a week during the weeks in January and 
February 2000 under review.  Applicant is highly regarded by his supervisors: They credit Applicant in his 2002 and 2003 performance reviews with solid 
performance achievements.  Noted achievements include meeting goals, complying with laws and regulations, and reporting all labor changes truthfully (<EM>see 
</EM>exs. C and D).</SPAN></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1 Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1 The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 5 The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a praiseworthy military and civilian record, but over the course of the past ten years has been involved in a series of incidents over misuse of 
company issued parking passes and mischarging of labor hours, for which he was disciplined by his employer in two of the incidents.  These incidents raise 
security concerns over whether he possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness for eligibility to access classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Over the course of a seven year period Applicant misused parking privileges extended by his employer by altering parking passes on two occasions (in 1995 and 
again in 1998) and more recently (January through February 2000) failed to clearly and accurately swipe his gate pass through the tunrstiles so as to document 
his working the 40 hours a week for which he was being compensated for.  Few of the determined inconsistencies in Applicant's time records for the period 
under investigation could be translated into net labor mischarges.  Certain 8-hour time blocs could not be reconciled and were assumed to represent 
unaccounted for work hours by Applicant.  Based on the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">reviewed turnstile records, non-recorded turnstile data, and comments developed by the company's 
investigators covering the eight weeks under investigation</SPAN>, the investigation team made the recommendations which served as the basis for taking disciplinary 
action against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant's acknowledged parking pass abuses standing alone might not be material enough to raise security concerns their consideration in conjunction 
with any judgment lapses associated with his deficient accounting of work hours during the January-February 2000 time frame creates a potential pattern of 
dishonesty and rule violations cognizable under DC 1 (pattern dishonesty and rule violations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct.</P> 
 
<P>However, Applicant's characterized work mischarges remain in large part unsubstantiated.  The data and records provided by Applicant in this proceeding 
support his working over 40 hours a week for each of the weeks covered in the investigation.  This accepted premise enabled his counterpart (Ms. A) to win 
acknowledgment of compliance with the company's 40 hour-a-week policy.  Applicant, too, by his testimony and records, probatively establishes actual off-site 
work venues visited on the days not fully accounted for in the company's turnstile records.  His claims of working at least 40 hours in each of the weeks 
reviewed are accepted and enable Applicant to essentially refute much of the basis for his reprimand (using the company's criteria for exonerating Ms. A from 
any material breaches of company work policy).  So, at least as to the allegations covered by sub-paragraph 1.c of the SOR, these allegations are mostly 
unsubstantiated.  Those found inconsistencies in his work records that he is not able to fully reconcile with his own claims do not detract from his essential 
claim that he consistently performed at least 40 hours a week for his employer during the weeks under review.  In this respect, he complies with a principal 
work policy of the company.</P> 
 
<P> Except for isolated instances of mistaken judgment in exiting his facility without swiping his time card and fully documenting his whereabouts 
contemporaneously with his offsite and long distance trips, Applicant establishes a praiseworthy history for good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness in 
meeting his tasked mission requirements over a civilian career that spans over 30 years with his current employer.  He is credited in his most recent 
performance evaluations with compliance with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">laws and regulations, and reporting all labor changes truthfully</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>For the brief judgment lapses Applicant exhibited in misusing his company parking passes and failing to accurately document his work hours and whereabouts 
during the period under review he has expressed considerable remorse and commitments to avert such mistakes in the future.  To date, he has consistently 
avoided any repeat judgment lapses.   For his efforts, Applicant may invoke two mitigating conditions (MC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal 
conduct: MC 1 (the information was unsubstantiated) and MC 5 (the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress).</P> 
 
<P>With over three years now of reformed professional practices in his dealing with company rules and regulations (including parking passes and logging 
professional time), Applicant successfully overcomes adverse security concerns attributable to his past mistakes with company parking pass and charging 
policy. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline E.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
