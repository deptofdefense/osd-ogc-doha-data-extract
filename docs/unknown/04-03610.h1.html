mother-in-law and three siblings-in-law are citizens of and reside in the PRC.  Her mother-in-law is a housewife, as is her one sister-in-law.  One brother-in-law 
is retired from village work, and the other is an engineer.  The Applicant has not seen any of her in-laws since 1994.  None of the Applicant's foreign relatives 
is connected with any foreign government or subject to coercion.  The Applicant visited the PRC in 1994 and 1998.  She plans no further visits to the PRC.  
itigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 5, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on April 29, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 7, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 26, 2005, and the case was heard on October 
20, 2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The 
transcript (TR) was received on November 3, 2005.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Influence militates against the granting 
of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">41 years of age, has a 
aster's Degree, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of 
the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1989, the Applicant came to the U.S. to join her husband and to further her education (TR at page 13 lines 18~20, and at page 27 line 22 to page 29 line 19).  
She was awarded a Master's Degree in 1997 (<EM>Id</EM>, and Government Exhibit 2 at page 2).  In 2000, the Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has two 
native born American children (TR at page 13 lines 6~10, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) A).  She has a net worth in excess of $400,000 in the U.S. (TR at 
page 30 line 21 to page 31 line 20, and AppXs C~F).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.e.  The Applicant's parents are citizens of the PRC, but have permanent resident status and reside with the Applicant in the U.S. (TR at page 19 line 6 to 
page 24 line 19).  Her father is 70 and her mother is 68 (<EM>Id</EM>).  They are retired college professors (<EM>Ibid</EM>).  The Applicant's brother is a citizen and resident of the 
PRC (TR at page 19 line 6 to page 24 line 19).  He is an engineer, and has been approved for permanent resident status in the U.S. (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant's mother-in-law and three siblings-in-law are citizens of and reside in the PRC (TR at page 24 line 10 to page 27 line 21).  Her mother-in-law is a housewife, as is her one sister-in-law (<EM>Id</EM>).  She has two bothers-in-law.  One brother-in-law is retired from village work, and the other an engineer 
(<EM>Ibid</EM>).  The Applicant has not seen any of her in-laws since 1994 (TR at page 24 line 10 to page 27 line 21).  None of the Applicant's foreign relatives is 
connected with any foreign government (TR at page 33 lines 8~16, and at page 37 line 25 to page 38 line 10).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g.  The Applicant visited the PRC in 1994 and 1998 (TR at page 32 line 8 to page 33 line 7).  She also visited Hong Kong in 1997 (<EM>Id</EM>).  She plans no further 
visits to the PRC (TR at page 33 lines 17~25).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those who supervise or work with the Applicant think most highly of her, and would recommend her to a position of trust (AppXs I~L).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant came to the U.S. in 1989, in part,  to pursue her Master's Degree.  The Applicant's parent's, brother, mother-in-law, and siblings-in-law are 
citizens of the PRC.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence is therefore applicable as "[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a 
foreign country."  However, the Applicant's parents are permanent U.S. residents, and her brother has been approved for permanent resident status.  She has 
little contact with her in-laws since last seeing them more than ten years ago.  None of the Applicant's immediate family member is connected with any 
government, and there is no evidence that their presence in the U.S. or in the PRC can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be 
unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such attempt at exploitation (TR at page 34 lines 1~12).  The first mitigating condition is therefore 
applicable, as "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force 
the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States."  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline B is found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
