  Although the Applicant's written statements and explanations about events are relevant and material evidence that the Administrative Judge had to consider, the Judge was not bound by those statements and explanations.  Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant's statements and explanations in light of  the record evidence as a whole.  There is sufficient record evidence to support the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application.  The  federal government is not required to wait until an applicant has mishandled or failed to properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke  access to such information.

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August 16, 2002 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated June 30, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant was fired from a job in 1993; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions concerning SOR paragraph 1.b are erroneous; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by 
finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application in July 2000; (4) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse formal finding under Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct) is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (5) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law because there has been no showing that Applicant has mishandled classified information.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the 
Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains many factual assertions that seek to supplement the record evidence below.  Such statements constitute new evidence, which 
the Board cannot consider on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  The Board will consider only those arguments made by 
Applicant that do not rely on new evidence.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant was fired from a job in 1993</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by 
finding that Applicant was fired from a job in 1993.  This claim of error lacks merit.  The Administrative Judge noted that SOR paragraph 1.a alleged Applicant 
had been fired from a job in 1993, but concluded that Department Counsel had failed to present evidence to support that allegation, and entered a formal finding 
in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraph 1.a. </P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions concerning SOR paragraph 1.b are erroneous</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant 
had been terminated from a position as a security guard in January 1999 after a series of security infractions by him.  The Judge concluded that the facts and 
circumstances of Applicant's termination were pertinent to a determination about his judgment, trustworthiness or reliability to hold a security clearance.  On 
appeal, Applicant strongly objects to the Judge's findings and conclusions.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's written statements and explanations about the events leading up to his termination in 1999 (contained in the record below) are relevant and material 
evidence that the Administrative Judge had to consider.  However, those statements and explanations were not binding on the Judge.  When faced with 
conflicting record evidence, a Judge must weigh the record evidence as a whole and make findings of fact and draw reasonable conclusions.  The Judge's 
findings about this aspect of the case reflect a reasonable, legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's strong disagreement 
with the Judge's findings is not sufficient to show the Judge erred.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) at p. 10.</P> 
 
<P>Given the Administrative Judge's findings about the facts and circumstances of Applicant's  termination in 1999, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law for the Judge to draw adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Having found that Applicant was 
terminated as a security guard for failing to perform his duties properly, it was reasonable for the Judge to draw adverse conclusions about Applicant's 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability for purposes of adjudicating his security eligibility.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant on appeal does 
not demonstrate the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline E are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-00305 (February 
12, 2003) at p. 4 (Administrative Judge must weigh the record evidence and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice 
versa</EM>); ISCR Case No. 01-00274 (January 27, 2003) at p. 3 ("A party's ability to point to evidence in their favor does not prove that the Administrative Judge 
erred in weighing the evidence as a whole.").</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application in July 2000</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that 
Applicant falsified a security clearance application in July 2000 by failing to disclose that he had been terminated from a position as a security guard in January 
1999.  Applicant challenges that finding of falsification.</P> 
 
<P>During the proceedings below, Applicant denied any intent to falsify the security clearance application and claimed that he never was formally notified that he 
had been terminated in January 1999.  The Administrative Judge had to consider Applicant's denial of any intent to falsify and his explanation for not 
disclosing his 1999 termination from employment.  However, the Judge was not bound to accept Applicant's denial and explanation.  Rather, the Judge had to 
consider them in light of the record evidence as a whole and make a finding of fact as to whether Applicant's failure to disclose the 1999 termination was a 
falsification.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at p. 3.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's finding of falsification is 
sustainable.  Applicant's appeal argument on this aspect of the case is not persuasive and fails to demonstrate the Judge's finding of falsification is erroneous.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse formal finding under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge entered a formal finding against Applicant under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) based on her conclusion that Applicant's falsification of 
a security clearance application in July 2000 constituted a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1000, a federal felony.  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge's adverse 
formal finding under Guideline J, arguing that: (a) he did not falsify the security clearance application; and (b) he does not have a history or pattern of criminal 
conduct.</P> 
 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge's finding of falsification is sustainable.  Furthermore, the Judge's conclusion that falsification of 
a security clearance application constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 is legally correct.  <EM>See United States v. Yermian</EM>, 468 U.S. 63 (1984)(case involving 
conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1001 based on falsification of security clearance application).  Given the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security 
clearance application in July 2000, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant's falsification was a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  That legal conclusion 
provides a rational basis for the Judge's adverse formal finding under Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because there has been no showing that Applicant has 
mishandled classified information</SPAN>.  Applicant also asserts that he has never mishandled classified information and that his track record on this point shows he is 
trustworthy and reliable.  The Board construes this argument as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, 
or contrary to law because there has been no showing that Applicant has mishandled classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government is not required to wait until an applicant has mishandled or failed to properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or 
revoke access to such information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Furthermore, nothing in 
Executive Order 10865 or the Directive requires a showing that there has been a security violation before an adverse security clearance decision can be made.  
Even if there has been no showing that an applicant has committed a security violation,  an Administrative Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole 
to determine whether the applicant possesses or lacks the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of persons granted access to 
classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-01494 (May 28, 2003) at p. 3.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's findings and conclusions 
provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guidelines E and Guideline J, and provide a sufficient basis for her adverse security clearance 
decision.</P>
