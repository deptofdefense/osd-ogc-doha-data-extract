  A Statement of Reasons need not cite or quote every provision of the Directive that could be pertinent to the adjudication of an applicant's case.  If there is admitted or proven conduct that raises security concerns, then an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant a favorable  security clearance decision.  Under Directive, security clearance decisions are not reduced to mechanical, formula adjudication; nor are they left to the  unfettered discretion of security clearance adjudicators.  Administrative Judges cannot create a new mitigating condition beyond those listed in the Directive  and make compliance with that judicially-created mitigating condition a prerequisite for a favorable security clearance decision.  Under Directive, the Judge is  expressly authorized to consider the presence or absence of rehabilitation.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the record  evidence.  Adverse decision affirmed.  </P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of  Reasons (SOR) dated November 29, 2002 which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).  Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated 
August 21, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether DOHA failed to provide adequate notice to Applicant that it was basing its intent to deny his 
clearance on Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders); (2) whether the Administrative Judge arbitrarily required Applicant to provide 
evidence of his having received therapy or some form of counseling; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had failed to 
provide sufficient evidence of his criminal rehabilitation.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that over a period of six months in 1996-1997 Applicant knowingly entered the property of his neighbor for a lewd purpose 
and looked into the bedroom window of the neighbor's teenage daughter where he observed her in various stages of undress.  The Judge also found that, at one 
point, Applicant engaged in deception of the girl's family and the girl by pretending to want to help them catch the perpetrator after they became aware of the 
problem.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant was eventually apprehended and convicted of a misdemeanor for his actions.  The Judge 
acknowledged that some evidence in mitigation was relevant to the case but because Applicant had not sought therapy or counseling, the mitigating evidence 
present in the case was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether DOHA failed to provide adequate notice to Applicant that it was basing its intent to deny his clearance on Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and 
Personality Disorders)</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that DOHA failed to provide adequate notice to him in the November 29, 2002 SOR of its intent to deny or revoke 
his access to classified information based on Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders) because it failed to notify him that whether or not there 
was evidence of successful rehabilitation, therapy, counseling or evaluation would be a basis for determining whether Applicant should retain his security 
clearance.  Applicant's argument lacks merit.  DOHA is required to provide an applicant with a written SOR that is as detailed and comprehensive as the 
national security permits.  <EM>See </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.3.  Although an SOR is an administrative pleading that is not held to the 
strict requirements of a criminal indictment, an applicant is entitled to receive adequate notice of the allegations against him.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-17539 (May 2, 2003) at p. 5 n. 5.  In this case, Applicant was provided with an SOR which placed him on reasonable notice that his illicit sexual behavior was a 
matter of security concern.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also argues that the Administrative Judge erred by relying on Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders) even though Guideline I 
was not alleged in the SOR.  That argument lacks merit.</P> 
 
<P>Although the decision below does not appear to rely on Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders), it cites (twice) the following language from 
a footnote to Guideline D which reads as follows: "The adjudicator should also consider guidelines pertaining to criminal conduct (Guideline J) and emotional, 
mental, and personality disorders (Guideline I) in determining how to resolve the security concerns raised by sexual behavior."  That footnote can be found at 
Directive, Enclosure 2, Attachment 4.<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR issued to Applicant placed him on notice that DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified 
information based, in part, on Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).   Although an SOR must place an applicant on reasonable notice of the allegations against the 
applicant, it need not cite or quote every provision of the Directive that could be pertinent to the adjudication of the applicant's case.<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The footnote to 
Guideline D is not nullified or rendered inoperative just because it is not cited or quoted in an SOR with allegations based on Guideline D.  Given the footnote 
to Guideline D, Applicant was on sufficient notice that the conduct alleged in the SOR under Guideline D might be evaluated under Guideline I. </P> 
 
<P>2.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge arbitrarily required Applicant to provide evidence of his having received therapy or some form of counseling</SPAN>.  Applicant 
argues that the Administrative Judge placed undue emphasis on the fact that he had not sought therapy and that the weight she accorded this aspect of the case 
was arbitrary because: (a) there was no evidence of record that Applicant suffered from any mental or psychological condition; and (b) he had successfully 
completed court ordered supervision (of ninety days duration with no evidence of what the supervision entailed) prior to the criminal charge being dismissed.  
Resolution of this appeal issue requires a discussion of Applicant's burden of persuasion under the Directive and the requirements of a security clearance 
decision.</P> 
 
<P>If there is admitted or proven conduct that raises security concerns, then an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant a favorable 
security clearance decision.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Under the Directive, security clearance decisions are not reduced to 
mechanical, formula adjudication; nor are they left to the unfettered discretion of security clearance adjudicators.  Rather, in deciding whether an applicant has 
met that burden of persuasion, an Administrative Judge must:</P> 
 
<P>(a) consider the record evidence as a whole<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>;</P> 
 
<P>(b) make findings of fact that reflect a reasonable sense interpretation of the record evidence as a whole<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>;</P> 
 
<P>(c) assess the particular facts and circumstances of an applicant's case under the general factors of Directive, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.1;</P> 
 
<P>(d) apply Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions that are appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the case<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>;</P> 
 
<P>(e) exercise sound judgment in the evaluation of the pertinent factors<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>;</P> 
 
<P>(f) draw reasonable inferences and conclusions about the security concerns raised by an applicant's conduct and circumstances that take into account the totality 
of the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>; and</P> 
 
<P>(g) make a reasoned decision as to whether an applicant has met his or her burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for the applicant.<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant had the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
security clearance decision.  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole (both favorable and unfavorable), evaluate the facts and circumstances of 
Applicant's past conduct and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met his burden of 
persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  In deciding whether Applicant had met his burden of persuasion under Item 
E3.1.15, the Judge reasonably could consider whether Applicant presented evidence that was indicative of extenuation, mitigation, changed circumstances, or 
reform and rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal arguments raise a serious issue, but they fail to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  The Board has held that a Judge cannot create a 
new mitigating condition (beyond those listed in the Directive) and make compliance with that judicially-created mitigating condition a prerequisite for a 
favorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0066 (August 28, 1998) at pp. 2-3.  However, the Directive explicitly requires a Judge to 
take into consideration the "[a]bsence or presence of rehabilitation" (Directive, Section 6.3.5) and "[t]he presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes" (Directive, Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.1.6).  Because an applicant has the burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15, and because Section 6.3.5 and Item E2.2.1.6 specifically refer to the presence or absence of rehabilitation, it is not arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law for a Judge to take into consideration the presence or absence of evidence supportive of an applicant's claim of reform and 
rehabilitation.<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Administrative Judges cannot impose their own notions of the specific kinds of treatment, counseling or other rehabilitation that an applicant must demonstrate 
in order to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  However, in assessing whether an 
applicant has met his or her burden under Item E3.1.15, Judges can consider whether an applicant has presented any evidence of treatment, counseling, or other 
form of rehabilitative action that is reasonably related to the kind of conduct or circumstances that form the basis for the particular security concerns in the case 
before them.  While the presence or absence of such evidence is not dispositive,<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> it is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the Directive for the Judge to 
consider the presence or absence of such evidence.</P> 
 
<P>The fact that Applicant had not already been diagnosed with an emotional or mental health issue did not preclude the Judge from taking into account the lack of 
seeking therapy in this case. Given the aberrational nature of Applicant's conduct, the fact that it was repeated over a period of several months, and the fact that 
Applicant actively deceived the victim and the victim's family by pretending to help them prevent further incidents while, in fact, he was the perpetrator, the 
Judge's concerns about the possibility of an undiagnosed and unresolved emotional or mental health problem were reasonable.<A HREF="02-05110.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>   The fact that Applicant had 
completed court-ordered supervision was a factor that the Administrative Judge was required to consider in her evaluation of the case, but it did not require her 
to conclude that Applicant had been successfully rehabilitated and it does not detract from her conclusion that the evidence of rehabilitation fell short of 
overcoming the security concerns raised by the overall facts and circumstances of Applicant's criminal sexual misconduct.</P> 
 
<P>3.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of rehabilitation</SPAN>.  Applicant points to favorable 
evidence of record, including the facts that his criminal activity occurred six years ago and there have been no subsequent arrests, his completion of supervision 
and the dismissal of the criminal charge, his successful marriage of 26 years, his successful military career, his long history of holding a security clearance, his 
favorable performance evaluations and favorable recommendations from co-workers and superiors, and his standing in the community.  Relying on that 
favorable evidence, Applicant asserts the Administrative Judge erroneously concluded that he had failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation.  Applicant 
concedes that the Judge acknowledged the passage of time since the incidents and the fact that there was no evidence of subsequent misconduct.  However, 
Applicant argues that the Judge erroneously discounted that favorable evidence and that she disregarded or ignored the mitigating evidence he presented.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge has considered all the evidence presented.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at 
p. 2.  In this case, the Judge cited the factors that Applicant acknowledges are in the decision, and there is no indication that the Judge did not consider other 
favorable evidence presented by the Applicant.  An Administrative Judge is not required to cite every piece of evidence that he or she relies upon in reaching a 
decision.  A reading of the Administrative Judge's decision in this case, which includes a discussion of favorable evidence presented by Applicant, convinces 
the Board that the Judge considered mitigating evidence and did not simply ignore it.</P> 
 
<P>The fact that the mitigating evidence presented by Applicant did not lead the Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish error.  The Judge 
must weigh the record evidence as a whole and decide whether the unfavorable evidence outweighs the favorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>, and whether under the 
totality of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case the applicant has met his or her burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Applicant had failed to demonstrate the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when she weighed the 
record evidence as a whole and concluded Applicant had not satisfied his burden of persuasion under Item E3.1.15.  </P>
