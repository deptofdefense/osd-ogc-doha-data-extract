<P>The Applicant and her ex-spouse filed for the protection of bankruptcy in March of 1997.  The bankruptcy was due to the failure of her husband's family's 
grocery store.  Federal tax liens for tax years 1992~1995 have been filed against the Applicant and her ex-spouse.  She thought her ex-spouse had filed these tax 
returns, returns she had signed; but he did not file them.  The Applicant's ex-spouse admits his culpability, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views her as 
an "Innocent Spouse."  As a result, the IRS only requires her to pay $25 each month towards tax liens totaling in excess of $83,000.  When the Applicant 
executed her 2003 Security Clearance Application (SCA), she answered "No" to question 36.  She thought the tax liens were filed more than seven years prior.  
She violated her employer's rules in 2002 by recording another's phone calls.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on September 9, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 28, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 12, 2005, and the case was heard on November 
16, 2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The 
transcript (TR) was received on November 30, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's Financial Considerations and alleged Personal Conduct 
militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations, but denies any wilful 
falsification as alleged in subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">51 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F -Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.e.  The Applicant and her ex-spouse filed for the protection of bankruptcy in March of 1997 (TR at page 18 line 2 to page 19 line 15, and Government 
Exhibit (GX) 7).  The bankruptcy was due to the failure of her husband's family's grocery store (TR at page 18 line 2 to page 19 line 15).  Federal tax liens for 
tax years 1992~1995 have been filed against the Applicant and her ex-spouse (GX 3~6).  The Applicant thought her ex-spouse had filed these tax returns, 
returns she had signed; but, in fact, he did not file the returns (TR at page 19 line 16 to page 20 line 8, at page 20 line 17 to page 22 line 18, and at page 24 lines 
9~24).  The Applicant's ex-spouse admits his culpability, and the IRS views the Applicant as an "Innocent Spouse" (TR at page 32 lines 2~21, and Applicant's 
Exhibits (AppXs A and B).  As a result, the IRS only requires her to pay $25 each month towards tax liens totaling in excess of $83,000 (TR at page 32 lines 
2~21, and AppX A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.  When the Applicant executed her July 2003 SCA, she answered "No" to question 36 (GX 1 at page 7).  The posited question asks, in part, "In the <STRONG>last 7 
years</STRONG>, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes . . . ?" (<EM>Id</EM>, emphasis supplied).  She thought the tax liens had been filed more 
than seven years prior, as the last lien referred to tax year 1995, which should have been filed more than seven years prior to her executing the SCA (TR at page 
25 line 25 to page 29 line 15, and at page 33 lines 11~21).  [It is unclear from the record exactly when the tax liens were filed.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b.  The Applicant violated her employer's rules in 2002 by monitoring an ex-boy friend's  phone calls for a week in 2002 (TR at page 29 line 16 to page 32 
lin1).  Many of her co-workers know of this violation of her employer's rules, as does her ex-boy friend (TR at page 32 to page 33 line 10, and at page 33 line 
22 to page 34 line 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thirty four individuals who supervise and/or work with the Applicant think most highly of her (AppXs C and D).  They have no reservations about 
recommending the Applicant for a position of trust (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations); which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unacceptable Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's Financial Considerations, the first and arguably the third disqualifying conditions are applicable as the Applicant had a 
"history of not meeting [her] financial obligations," and there was an "[i]inabilty or unwillingness to satisfy [her] debts."  However, the Applicant's financial 
difficulties can be directly attributed to circumstances "largely beyond . . . [her] control (e.g., . . . a business downturn . . . )."  The third mitigating condition is 
therefore applicable.  Furthermore, the Applicant, by filing for and receiving the protection of an "Innocent Spouse" vis-a-vis the tax liens, has addressed all of 
the alleged past due debts.  The last mitigating condition is therefore applicable, as she has "initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or <STRONG>otherwise 
resolve debts</STRONG>" (Emphasis supplied).  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline F is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to her alleged wilful falsification, I can find no intent to keep information from the Government.  When the Applicant filled out her SCA, she reasonably 
thought that the tax liens had been filed more than seven year prior to executing the SCA.  The Applicant's trustworthiness is attested to by those with whom he 
works.  She therefore answered the posited questions truthfully and to the best of her ability.  As to the rule violation in recording another employee's phone 
calls, this is not a "pattern" of "rule violations," as required by the fifth disqualifying condition.  However, the fourth disqualifying condition is arguably 
applicable, as this "[p]ersonal conduct . . . increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress . . ."  This is countered, however, by the 
fifth mitigating condition.  By telling others in her work place, to include her ex-boy friend, of her malfeasance, she "has taken positive steps to significantly 
reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Guideline E is also found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her Financial Considerations, and her Personal Conduct.  The 
Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guidelines E and F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
