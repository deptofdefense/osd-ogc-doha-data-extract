<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was an alcohol abuser who was previously assessed and evaluated as such under the criteria of the DSM-IV.</SPAN>  His <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">16 years of alcohol abuse resulted in 
one arrest for DWI (in 1986) and two arrests for DUI (in 1999 when the charge was dismissed, and 2002), followed up by court action.  Since being assessed

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, dated April 6, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on 
September 20, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same date, and the hearing was held on October 5, 2004.  During the hearing, six Government 
exhibits, four Applicant exhibits<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
October 14, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol under Guideline G (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to retain a security clearance which was previously granted to him in October 1984.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was an alcohol abuser.  He commenced consuming alcohol at some point prior to 1986, but that early alcohol consumption was undistinguished as to 
quantity and frequency. Commencing in June 1986, it became something of a problem and he was subsequently involved in three alcohol-related incidents 
resulting in arrests (1986, 1999, and 2002).  In June 1986, Applicant visited his brother for the first time in several years and consumed between two and four 
beers on an empty stomach.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Realizing he was running late for a flight, he departed and was eventually stopped for speeding and administered a field sobriety 
test after the officer smelled alcohol on his breath.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Although the results of the test have not been specified, he was arrested and charged with driving while 
intoxicated (DWI).<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  After remaining in jail over night and entering a plea of no contest, Applicant was sentenced to 90 days confinement,<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> ordered to pay a 
fine and court costs, and given two years of probation.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Despite the information appearing in the FBI record, Applicant continues to dispute the accuracy of the 
record and contends he was not sentenced to any confinement time.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The charge was eventually expunged from his record.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1999, Applicant went to dinner with some friends and consumed some wine and "stuff" during dinner<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and cocktails and two beers thereafter.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  
After returning to his hotel, Applicant had to go to a store for contact lens solution, and, a few minutes before midnight,<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> while driving back ran through a stop 
sign.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He was administered a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The breathalyzer machine was not working properly, and a blood test was provided.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  
No results of the blood test have been divulged, but based on the field sobriety test results, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence 
of alcohol.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant acknowledged he was intoxicated at the time, but contends he was still safe to drive.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Two months later, the charge was dismissed on 
the motion of the district attorney for insufficient evidence.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2002, after working late, Applicant consumed three or four beers<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> and some cocktails at the hotel.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  He and his colleagues looked for a 
restaurant but they were all closed because of the time and the inclement weather.  They stayed at another bar and he continued to consume a couple more 
beers.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Applicant then decided to look for an open grocery store.  On the way to one, after changing lanes, he was stopped by the police for an improper lane 
change.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He was administered a field sobriety test after the officer smelled alcohol on his breath.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Although the results of the test have not been specified, 
he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant acknowledged he was intoxicated at the time.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He eventually entered a plea for 
probation before judgment and was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation and ordered to pay a fine and court costs.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In March 2003, upon the advice of his attorney, Applicant underwent a substance abuse assessment or evaluation conducted by a Certified Independent Social 
Worker (C.I.S.W.).  As part of the assessment he was interviewed and administered a Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI).  Based on the 
results of the SASSI, the evaluator concluded Applicant had a "low probability of having a substance abuse dependence disorder.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  However, because of 
concerns voiced by Applicant's family, the evaluator also concluded that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol abuse in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the <EM>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders</EM>, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN> He recommended Applicant continue to abstain, attend six Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and 
attend two Mothers' Against Drunk Driving (MADD.) meetings.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has seemingly abstained since his December 2002 arrest--nearly two years, although he acknowledged consuming alcohol on weekends while 
playing golf or in a social situation.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He attended AA and MADD meetings, and attributes his continuing abstinence to what he learned during those 
meetings, as well as to a commitment to his family after realizing how traumatic the entire experience has been.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Applicant no longer attends AA meetings, 
and while he claims to have learned a lot from them, cannot recite either the Serenity Prayer nor any of the 12 steps.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  He denied having an alcohol problem,<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> 
but has vowed never to consume it again.<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant earned an M.B.A. degree in 1994.  He has been employed by the same government contractor or successor company since August 1984, and is 
currently serving as a flight test engineer.  His direct supervisor considers Applicant to be one of his two most reliable employees,<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> and Applicant's 
performance appraisal characterized his performance as excellent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security" standard<A HREF="03-12314.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard.  For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded those standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, 
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship the government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
are predictive in nature and must often address potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline G.  Commencing at some point in 1986, and continuing periodically until December 2002, Applicant 
seemingly threw caution to the wind and exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature behavior by abusing alcohol.  His alcohol 
consumption resulted in one arrest for DWI in 1986 and two arrests for DUI in 1999 and 2002, followed up by court action.  These incidents and the conduct 
which contributed to the incidents fall within Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. (<EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>) and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5.(<EM>habitual 
or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>).  However, because there is no evidence that alcohol had any impact on his job performance 
and activities, there does not appear to be any justification to apply AC DC E2.A7.1.2.2. (<EM>alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty 
in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the 2002 incident, Applicant's attorney advised him to undergo an alcohol assessment or evaluation.  He did so in March 2003.  His condition was 
initially tentatively identified as </SPAN>a "low probability of having a substance abuse dependence disorder, but because of concerns voiced by Applicant's family, the 
evaluator also concluded that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol abuse in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the DSM-IV.</SPAN>  The evaluator recommended Applicant continue to abstain and 
attend AA and MADD meetings<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant did so, and has seemingly continued to abstain for nearly two years.  While the evidence of abstinence is 
inconsistent, largely because of Applicant's varying stories in this regard, the testimony of his wife tips the scale in favor of a finding of abstinence.  The 
alcohol assessment or evaluation conducted by the C.I.S.W. was not a diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional, and thus does not fall within AC DC 
E2.A7.1.2.3. (<EM>diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence</EM>).  
Likewise, because the record is silent as to whether the C.I.S.W. was a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program, the evaluation does not come 
within AC DC E2.A7.1.2.4. (<EM>evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized 
alcohol treatment program</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions since the alcohol assessment and evaluation, including his limited participation in AA and MADD meetings, along with continuing 
abstinence, reveal an individual who has dramatically altered his attitude, relationship with alcohol, and his lifestyle.  That changed behavior clearly falls within 
Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.3. (<EM>positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>) and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2. (<EM>the 
problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the evidence presented, I am confident that Applicant's alcohol abuse of the past will not recur.  There is convincing evidence of current abstinence and 
sobriety.  He has taken efforts to rehabilitate himself, and it appears he has, in fact, been successful.  Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and 
explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to the issue of alcohol consumption.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 
1.e. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
