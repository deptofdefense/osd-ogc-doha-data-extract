<P>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. He has paid off the majority of his debts, and he has a legitimate dispute with four of his remaining overdue debts. His financial situation is now 
stable and current. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> reasonably believed that the financial information that </SPAN>he<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> provided to the Government on a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, regarding his overdue debts was

<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 15</SPAN>, 2005 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>October 22, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations (RSOR), and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April</SPAN> 24<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to the parties on May 4, 2006, and the hearing was held on May 23, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-10) and one witness was called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 
A through G) and offered his own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without objection. After the hearing, the record was left open for Applicant to offer additional 
documentary exhibits regarding his alleged payment of other debts. Applicant offered additional timely documents, which have been marked collectively as Exhibit H (1-20). This final exhibit was 
not objected to by Department Counsel and has been entered into evidence.  The transcript (Tr) was received on June 6, 2006. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains 21 allegations, 1.a. through 1.u., under Guideline F, and four allegations, 2.a. through 2.d., under</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.u., with some 
explanations, and he denied allegations 2.a. through 2.d. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> indicated that the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> would be offering no evidence in support of allegation 2.c.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 57 years old. He is married and has two daughters. He has a Master's Degree in System Engineering. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is employed as an Engineering Specialist by a defense contractor, and he

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. This debt to Creditor 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $5,607. At the hearing, Applicant contended that this debt was paid in </SPAN>June 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Exhibit A is a final statement of a new loan that 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> received on his home with a summary of payments from the proceeds made to outstanding creditors.  Exhibit A and  H1 show that a payment of $2,804 was paid to resolve this debt. I find 
that the current balance on this debt is $0</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. This debt to Creditor 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $12,917.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. This debt to Creditor 3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is in the amount of $160. Applicant testified that he disputes this bill, because his medical insurance carrier explained to him that this amount would not be covered under 
his policy, because this was in excess of a reasonable charge for the medical service rendered by this health care provider. While he testified that he could resolve this debt easily, he believes that 
since this debt is for an excessive charge, he should not be required to pay the amount in excess of what this creditor received through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> insurance carrier. I find that it is reasonable for

Applicant also disputes these bills, because his insurance carrier explained to 
him that these amounts also would not be covered under his policy, because the charges for the medical service rendered are excessive. I find that it is reasonable for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> to dispute these 
medical charges. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.p. This debt to Creditor 13</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR in the amount of $5,572. At the hearing, Applicant contended that this debt was paid.  However, in his post hearing submission, he indicated that he 
could not find the documentation to establish that this debt had been resolved.  At the hearing, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that there were two debts that he had paid before he refinanced his mortgage, 
because the creditor had given him a deadline, but he was not sure which debts they were. While this may have been one of those debts, I can not find that this debt has been paid, and therefore the 
current balance on this debt is $5,572.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Unless Applicant can find documentation to show that this debt was resolved, he is required to pay this debt.</SPAN></P>

Exhibit A and  H14 show that a payment of

<P>1.u.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> alleges that Applicant has a net remainder of $775 a month and $18,000 in an account in India, yet he has  made little attempt to make any payments on his overdue debts. 
Based on paragraphs 1.a through 1.t., as discussed above, I find that Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has now made payments on the majority of his overdue debts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> gave an explanation as to why he had incurred these overdue debts. His daughter attended five years of college from 2000 to 2005, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and his wife took loans in the form of a 
line of credit on his home to pay for her education. He also lost </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> $200,000 in the stock market from 2000 to 2004. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> currently has one credit card in his wife's name and four in his daughter's name that he is able to use. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He is not overdue on any of these cards, and he now pays off the credit card in a 
timely fashion. Applicant's wife, who was unemployed for many years due to serious illness, has become employed full time in 2005, and she contributes approximately $30,000 in additional 
family income. Applicant now has approximately $16,000 invested in the stock market, and he does not plan to increase that amount.  Applicant also has some additional assets. He has a checking 
account with $13,000, and an account to pay for his second daughter's college education in the amount of $25,000. Finally, Applicant testified that in the 401ks and IRAs owned by him and his 
wife, he has $500,000, and he is fully vested in his company's pension plan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted his 2004 Salary Notice (Exhibit C) which showed that his 2004 Performance Evaluation rated his performance as "Exceeded expectations" and awarded him a $5,000 raise.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges that when Applicant completed a signed, sworn <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 10 , 2002, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 1), </SPAN>he did not furnish truthful, complete answers.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. Question #38 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  "No" was checked off for this question and no debts were listed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b. Question #39 asks,  "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?""No" was checked on this question and again no debts were listed (Exhibit 4)</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time Applicant  completed the SCA, he was aware that he was delinquent on some of the debts listed on the SOR. However, Applicant testified that although he was paying his debts late, he 
was still making payments on these debts, so he did not believe he was currently over 90 days overdue nor did he believe that he had been over 180 days overdue within the last 7 years. Since 
Applicant was disputing the debts to the medical providers, as alleged in 1.c. through1.g., he did not believe these debts should be included.  The </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has shown that Applicant was overdue 
on his debts, but not that he was overdue </SPAN>for more than 90 days at the time he completed the SCA or over 180 days for the 7 years before he completed the SCA. I cannot find that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> gave 
false information on questions 37 and 38 on his SCA.</P> 
 
<P>2.c. As stated above, the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> did not introduce any evidence to establish this allegation. I find 2.c. for <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>2.d. The <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> alleges in this paragraph that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> stayed in the United States  on an expired student visa from 1975 to 1977. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> denied this allegation and introduced his former 
Indian passport (Exhibit B) and a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation report (Exhibit 6) to establish that he left the United States in1975. While evidence was introduced to establish 
that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did not comply with the requirement to notify the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) when he became employed after he was a student, the evidence is clear that he did not 
remain in the United States on an expired visa. I find that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> failure to notify the INS regarding his employment did show poor judgement. However, this occurred more than 30 years ago, 
and there has been no evidence introduced to suggest that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has had any other lapses in judgement in this regard or violated any other rules or regulations.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties. The evidence shows that Applicant has made <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">recent good faith efforts to pay 
these debts. While he has not satisfied all of his overdue bills, he has resolved the vast majority of his debts, and he does not appear to be overdue on any of his current debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN>under Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations 
and his former unwillingness to satisfy his debts. However, I now find that Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.6. applies because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue 
creditors and resolve his debts. He is exhibiting a serious approach so that he will avoid falling into these financial difficulties in the future.  I, therefore,  resolve Guideline F for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence did not establishes that Applicant provided inaccurate information to the Government in response to questions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#38  and #39,</SPAN> on the SCA.  I conclude that 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> was overdue on the payment of some of his debts at the time he completed and executed <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his SCA on December</SPAN> 10, 2002.  However, based on the way he was paying his debts, he did 
have a reasonable basis for  believing he was not overdue for the time periods requested by these questions, and the evidence has not proven that he was overdue for 90 or 180 days.</P> 
 
<P>Additionally, while <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did not notify the INS when he became employed, he did not remain in the United States on an expired visa, and there has been no other example of a violation of any 
rules or regulations in more than 30 years. </P> 
 
<P>I conclude that no DC applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>under Guideline E. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
