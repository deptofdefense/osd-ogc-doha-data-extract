<P>Applicant, a scientist with a major shipbuilder of Chinese ancestry from Taiwan, had six missing confidential documents in 1998 while a U.S. Navy employee.
He also had two Chinese (PRC) professional contacts and a daughter who lived in Shanghai briefly while working for a U.S. bank. He allegedly omitted and

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On August 9, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry,</EM> as
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On September 4, 2002, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was
assigned to another administrative judge who could not hold the hearing. The first notice of hearing was issued on May 15, 2003. An amended notice of hearing
was issued on May 23, 2003, setting the hearing for July 22, 2003. The matter was reassigned to me on July 21, 2003, and the hearing was held on July 22 and
28, 2003. The government introduced eleven exhibits and the Applicant introduced five. One exhibit offered by the government was not admitted. All others
were admitted into evidence except for one paragraph in Exhibit 11. The transcripts were received on July 30 (Vol.1) and August 7, 2003 (Vol. 2).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant admitted all of the specific allegations under Guidelines K, B, and E except for paragraph 3c under E but disagreed with the adverse interpretation
placed on all allegations. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following additional findings of
fact are made. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant is a native of Taiwan who has a college degree from a university in Taiwan and graduate degrees from two U.S. universities. He has written or
collaborated on a large number of technical articles and papers published in professional journals or by the U.S. government. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant is a scientist on naval architecture with a major U.S. shipbuilding corporation contracting with the U.S. Navy. He retired from the Navy in 1998
where he had done the same type of work since 1968. He has continued to hold a security clearance since his retirement. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In 1998 Applicant could not account for six confidential documents from the classified library in his agency. When a security officer questioned him at a
random security check he could not locate or account for them. He retired two months later and never heard further about the issue until two interviews were
taken in 1999 (Exh 3 and 4). His supervisor wrote an explanatory memo about the matter in May of 1998. (Exh. 8) His exit checkout was approved when he left
the agency. (Exh. E)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Documents such as those at issue in this matter were often put in the burn bag when no longer needed and not returned to the library. (TR Vol. 1, 63)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant attended numerous international conferences where persons engaged in his field met to exchange information. One of those was a scientist from the
PRC with whom Applicant is alleged to have a relationship who had similar responsibilities in the PRC as Applicant had for the U.S. Navy. All meetings were
approved by his supervisors and reports were filed with his supervisor after each meeting. In several interviews with investigators and on applications for
security clearances these specific contacts were not reported although the international organization sponsoring the meetings was reported.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant's supervisor also had professional and personal contact with the same PRC scientist as the Applicant is alleged to have. (TR Vol 1., 88) Applicant
and his supervisor had occasional social contacts with both father and son when they were in the U.S. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant served a mandatory period of military service in Taiwan and described it in a security interview as related to sports. This was partially inaccurate in
that he was assigned to an ordnance factory but was running a sports program for them since the senior officers did not want a short term draftee doing
ordnance work that was being done to supply U.S. troops during the Viet Nam conflict (TR Vol 2, 101 and 102). </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant's daughter lived in Shanghai for a period of time ending in 2000 working part time at the U.S. consulate and learning the Chinese language. She lived
in the same apartment house as the son of the scientist from the PRC with whom Applicant is alleged to have a relationship. They did not live in the building at
the same time. Applicant's daughter now lives in the U.S. and works for a major U.S. corporation.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>The son of the scientist came to the U.S. and studied at a U.S. university where Applicant has taught since 1988. The son obtained a doctoral degree and
Applicant was one of three readers for his doctoral dissertation. Applicant also served as a reader for many other doctoral candidates and a mentor for other
students at several universities. After graduation the son was hired by the Applicant's agency but left in 1998 after a possible security breach and investigation.
Applicant's supervisor was aware of the facts of the investigation but could not divulge the information except to say the Applicant was not involved. (TR Vol
1, 86)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the

<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security clearances are

<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2.

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Security Violations-Guideline K</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Foreign Influence-Guideline B</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection,
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to
security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>While Applicant could not account for the six missing documents, the head of his office rebutted the allegation and pointed out the actual practices of the office
in a credible manner that successfully mitigated the allegation. The Disqualifying Condition (DC) under Guideline K was established by the security officials
that there had been noncompliance. However, the Mitigating Conditions (MC 1and 2) were established by the Applicant and his supervisor that the violation
was inadvertent and infrequent since there was no indication or proof of prior security breaches. The report by the supervisor in response to the security officials
apparently was accepted as Applicant was permitted to retire and did not suffer any consequences or lose his clearance for the past six years. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The issue of Foreign Influence issue under Guideline B (DC) regarding Applicant's daughter and his professional and personal relations with two Chinese
(PRC) scientists was mitigated (MC 1) by the fact that the daughter is no longer a resident of Shanghai and his contacts with the two foreign citizens was casual
and infrequent (MC 2) and that his contacts with them were reported (MC 3). Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1 applies in that immediate family members are not
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power and thus do not constitute an unacceptable security risk.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The issue of Personal Conduct under Guideline E regarding Applicant's omission or falsification of relevant and material facts in his application for clearance
and interviews with security investigators (DC 2) and providing false and misleading information to investigators and officials. (DC 3) was successfully
mitigated by providing correct information to the officials and by Applicant's reasonable interpretation of the requirements. Applicant's reports of his trips to
international conferences including his contacts at the conferences show that these contacts were well known in his agency and provide a reasonable basis for
his determination that these government activities need not have been reported.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant's description of his military service in a 1993 security interview that omitted the fact that was assigned to the logistics ordnance arm of the military
was explained at the hearing that his actual work was in sports management for the facility and that was the reason for the description. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that he is trustworthy, reliable,
and eligible for access to classified information. </P>
