</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old married woman who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria and has since obtained U.S. citizenship, had five native-born children, 
earned a college degree in accounting, and, along with her husband, runs a successful company providing administrative and information technological services 
to the government. Although she has ties to Nigeria based on visiting and financially supporting her elderly mother and mother-in-law, those circumstances are 
unlikely to make Applicant potentially vulnerable to foreign influence. Moreover, Applicant's ties to the U.S. are so substantial that she can be expected to 
resist and report any potential foreign influence or pressure. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 22, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B for foreign influence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Answer to SOR is undated, but apparently submitted in November 2002. She admitted to the SOR's five factual allegations (subparagraphs 1.a. - 
1.e) with explanations, and she requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</P> 
 
<P>This case was initially assigned to another administrative judge, but DOHA reassigned the case to me on January 7, 2003, to conduct a hearing and issue a 
written decision. Thereafter, on January 16, 2003, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for Thursday, February 27, 2003, at a 
location near Applicant's place of employment. Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript March 7, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Concerning the SOR allegations in general, I find that the record evidence as a whole is sufficient to establish, by substantial evidence, the occurrence of all the 
factual events alleged in the SOR, except as otherwise noted (e.g., Applicant's father passed away in May 2002).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant testified during the hearing and I find her testimony was credible.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old married woman who was born in Nigeria and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her spouse was also born in Nigeria and became a 
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1986. She and her spouse have five children, ages 22 to 16. The children are all native-born U.S. citizens and reside here. Unmarried 
at the time, Applicant came to the U.S. with the idea of marrying her present husband. The couple married in April 1980. After going through the immigration 
process, Applicant obtained her U.S. citizenship in 1989. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her spouse have owned and operated their own company since 1988. She has served, until recently, as the vice-president of finance and is 
responsible for the accounting. Indeed, she earned a B.S. in accounting from a U.S. university in 1993. Her husband is the company president. They employ 
approximately 200 people located in ten states on various defense contracts providing administrative and information technology services (secretarial, clerical, 
travel order processing, transmitting messages, etc.) for the Departments of Defense, Army, and Air Force. With the exception of the four people at company 
headquarters, all employees work at military installations or governmental facilities where they may require a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her spouse appear to be financially successful. Last year, the company earned approximately $8 million in gross revenue, of which Applicant and 
her spouse were able to enjoy a handsome profit. Their residential real estate holdings (a home and two rental properties) have an estimated market value north 
of $900,000. The couple's other financial assets include, but are not limited to, $500,000 in certificates of deposit.</P> 
 
<P>Both Applicant and her husband have been and continue to be active in politics (voting, running for office, supporting candidates, etc.). Indeed, Applicant's 
husband was selected by the governor to serve as a state delegate at a recent national political convention.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant first applied for a security clearance in October 1992 and disclosed her parents' circumstances as well as her travel to Nigeria. Based on that 
application, she was issued a secret security clearance in December 1992. Thereafter, she was issued an interim top-secret security clearance in December 1999 
as well as October 2001. Although neither she nor her husband has had classified information at their company, it is in her capacity as a corporate officer that 
Applicant seeks to retain a security clearance in conjunction with the so-called facility clearance for the company. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's 72-year-old mother is a citizen of and resident in Nigeria. Her father passed away in May 2002. Until his death, Applicant was in the process of 
sponsoring her parents immigration to the U.S. Her mother is still involved in that process, which appears near its conclusion as her case was sent to the U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate in Lagos for processing and she is scheduled for an interview in July 2003. If allowed to immigrate to the U.S., the mother will reside 
with Applicant and her husband. Applicant's mother is unaware of the nature of the company's business.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's 80-year-old mother-in-law is a citizen of and resident in Nigeria. The mother-in-law is described as senile and her condition is such that she often 
does not recognize Applicant or her husband. Given her poor health, there are no plans for the mother-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The mother-in-law is also 
unaware of the nature of the company's business.  </P> 
 
<P>Given the elderly status of her parents and mother-in-law, both Applicant and her spouse have traveled to Nigeria for family visits. Applicant did so in at least 
1997, 1999, and 2001. During these trips, neither Applicant nor her husband have experienced any safety or security issues when in Nigeria. Likewise, they 
have never been approached or confronted by Nigerian governmental or military officials other than for routine matters (e.g., customs and immigration).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her spouse have provided financial support to their parents in Nigeria. The amounts range from $1,000 to $3,000 annually. The money was given 
to the parents when either Applicant or her spouse visited as the postal system is unreliable and using commercial banks was impractical due to the rural areas 
where the parents lived. That financial support continues, although it has decreased somewhat with the passing of Applicant's father.</P> 
 
<P>In approximately 1995, Applicant and her spouse decided to build a home for the mother-in-law. The resulting structure is fairly described as a one-bedroom 
home built from concrete blocks and a zinc metal roof. They did so because the mother-in-law was living in a sod house with mud walls and a thatched roof. 
The sod house required regular upkeep (e.g., removing mud, fixing the roof, etc.) due to the rainy season, and the new permanent structure eliminates those 
concerns and worries for Applicant and her husband. The total cost for labor and materials was about $30,000, which Applicant and her husband would bring to 
Nigeria in batches when they visited. </P> 
 
<P>The house is built on the family land of Applicant's husband. But due to the applicable inheritance laws and customs, Applicant's husband will not inherit the 
land and house upon his mother's passing because he is not present in Nigeria. Since Applicant's husband has no plans to return to live in Nigeria, it appears 
most unlikely that he will inherit this property. Instead, it will pass to a family member (of Applicant's husband's father's family) who is present. Although 
Applicant and her spouse stay in the house during their visits to Nigeria, the primary purpose for building the house was to provide some comfort for the 
mother-in-law during her old age. I specifically find the house and land is not a commercial, investment, or business interest in the sense that neither Applicant 
nor her husband is seeking to earn a profit. </P> 
 
<P>Concerning Nigeria, the U.S. Department of State reports<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> the following matters:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Nigeria is a developing West African country that has experienced periods of political instability. In 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule after 16 years of 
military rule.</LI> 
  <LI>Parts of Nigeria regularly experience localized civil unrest and violence, and the causes and locations vary.</LI> 
  <LI>Violent crime, committed by ordinary criminals as well as by persons in police and military uniforms, can occur throughout the country. Kidnaping for 
ransom of persons associated with the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens, remains common in the Niger Delta area.</LI> 
  <LI>Ongoing religious and ethic conflicts exist in Nigeria between Muslim and Christian groups and between other ethic groups.</LI> 
 
 
<P>Neither Applicant's mother nor mother-in-law live in an area of Nigeria identified by the U.S. State Department where outbreaks of violence have recently 
occurred. Moreover, both live in an area where the population is Christian, and so, there are no conflicts between Muslim and Christian groups in this area.</P> 
 
<P>    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are most 
pertinent here: Guideline B for foreign influence.<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B.<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies because 
Applicant's mother and mother-in-law, elderly women that Applicant visits irregularly and supports financially, are citizens of and residents in Nigeria. Indeed, 
this situation is essentially unchanged since Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 1992, with the exception of her father's passing. None of the 
other disqualifying conditions apply given the record evidence. </P> 
 
<P>In particular, DC 8<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> does not apply here for at least two reasons. First, the Nigerian home Applicant and her husband built for the mother-in-law is not a 
"financial interest" within the meaning of Guideline B. The facts and circumstances show this situation is akin to a gift to an elderly parent as opposed to a 
financial interest. Second, considering Applicant's (and her husband's) overall financial situation--consisting of sizeable assets in the U.S.--the Nigerian home 
is not a "substantial" financial interest within the meaning of Guideline B. Indeed,  the $30,000 cost is but a small percentage of their overall financial situation. 
As Applicant's husband put it, "So what is $30,000, that wouldn't drag me to a hole in Nigeria."<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> At any rate, given the surrounding facts and circumstances, 
the existence of the Nigerian home is, in my view, unlikely to make Applicant potentially vulnerable to foreign influence by coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </P> 
 
<P>In mitigation, Applicant's mother and mother-in-law are, in my view, relatively insignificant security concerns as far as making Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to foreign influence by either coercive or non-coercive means. Both are elderly women living in a rural area who were not employed by or connected with the 
Nigerian military, law enforcement, or a governmental agency. They are not involved in political, scientific, commercial, or other activities where they might 
benefit from obtaining U.S. national security information. Given the record evidence, I conclude Applicant's mother and mother-in-law are not agents of a 
foreign power, nor are they in positions to be exploited by a foreign power. Under these circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="02-22927.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> applies in Applicant's 
favor. The remaining mitigating conditions of Guideline B do not apply given the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Although MC 1 is the only applicable mitigating condition, the analysis does not necessarily end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security 
concerns. First, Applicant's mother may soon immigrate to the U.S. Presuming she does make that move, any potential security concerns attached to her will 
then decrease. Second, Applicant and her husband recognize that the mother-in-law has lived her life and they would not risk their current lives or livelihood in 
the U.S. in the unlikely event that the mother-in-law is used as leverage to obtain classified information. Third,  Applicant can fairly be described as a model 
immigrant. She's a mother of five native-born U.S. citizens who are pursuing lives, educations, and careers in the U.S., she's politically active, she's earned a 
college degree, and she's a successful businesswoman. Moreover, her spouse, children, professional career, and financial interests are in the U.S., and that 
situation is unlikely to change. These are examples of ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy such as the U.S. Accordingly, it is my 
predictive judgment, based on the record as a whole, that Applicant has the necessary strength of character so that she can be expected to resist and report any 
potential foreign influence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means.</P> 
 
<P>To conclude, after weighing the record evidence as a whole, the foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Applicant has overcome the case against her 
and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</P>
