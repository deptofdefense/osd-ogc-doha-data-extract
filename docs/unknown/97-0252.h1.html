</P>

<P>	On April 3, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to -------------------- (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 21, 1997.  This case was assigned
to the undersigned on July 2, 1997, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 10, 1997.  A hearing
was held on August 19, 1997, at which the Government presented three documentary exhibits.  The
Applicant presented twelve documentary exhibits and called two witnesses to testify on her behalf. </P>

<P>The Applicant also testified on her own behalf.</P>

<P>	The official transcript was received on August 29, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant is 49 years old, and married.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a
Computer Programmer/Analyst, and she is applying for a Secret level security clearance in
connection with her employment.</P>

<P>	The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of
allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are
entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion J - Criminal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because she repeatedly violated a State's Revised Statute, a felony, and the
misdemeanor provisions of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203, by failing to file annual
income tax returns, as required. </P>

<P>	As alleged in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f., the Applicant willfully failed to file
her State Income Tax Returns for 1993, 1994, and 1995, within the time required.  Her failure to do
so was in violation of the State's Revised Statutes.</P>

<P>	As alleged in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., and 1.e., the Applicant also failed to timely
file her 1993, 1994, and 1995, Federal Income Tax Returns within the time required.  Her failure to
do so was in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant understands her responsibility to file annual State and Federal Income Tax
Returns, and she is not a tax protestor.  Although the Applicant's husband has in the past been the
one to file their income tax returns, the Applicant understands that she is responsible for filing her
State and Federal income tax returns, and for paying the required taxes. </P>

<P>	Among her excuses for not filing her tax returns on time, the Applicant explained that from
1988 until 1993 she and her husband operated a home based business, a bed and breakfast, which
they were forced to close due to a severe business turndown in their town.  After moving from their
house, they attempted to start the business again, but were unable to get it off the ground.  This
created a series of financial difficulties for them which resulted in their filing Bankruptcy.  They lost
two houses, and were forced to move twice.  In the course of their moves, things were in boxes, and
they had trouble finding the documentation that they needed.  (Tr. Pg. 32).  From 1987 until 1995,
the Applicant's husband was unemployed, and she had a number of temporary jobs. </P>

<P>	In addition, the Applicant testified that for tax years 1990, 1991, and 1992, she and her
husband used a tax relief strategy called "income averaging".  During those years, they did not file
their income tax returns until 1993, and they were issued a refund from the taxing authorities.  With
respect to their 1993, 1994, and 1995 income tax returns, the Applicant was under a good faith, but
mistaken belief, that she and her husband could continued to income average.  It was only in March
1997, that the Applicant learned from her accountant that income averaging was no longer allowed. </P>

<P>	In November 1996, the Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Investigative Service
concerning her failure to file her 1993, 1994, and 1995 State and Federal income tax returns.  The
Applicant stated at that time that she was trying to get them filed by the end of November 1996.  (Tr.
Pgs. 28-29).</P>

<P>	On January 21, 1997, the Applicant provided a sworn statement to the Defense Investigative
Service wherein she stated that her husband had been on travel and had not had time to file their tax
returns.  The Applicant further stated that she was going to file her income tax returns as soon as
possible.  (Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant testified that within a week of her interview, she
forwarded her tax information to her tax accountant to prepare her tax returns.  (Tr. Pg. 42).</P>

<P>	On March 6, 1997, the day before the Applicant actually filed her income tax returns, the
Applicant telephoned the Special Agent who had previously interviewed her to inform him that she
was filing the income tax returns in question.  The Applicant also sent copies of each of these income
tax returns to the investigator.  (Tr. Pg. 38).</P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibits D, G and I are copies of all the State income tax returns in question and
verifies their filing with the State's Department of  Revenue on March 7, 1997.</P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibits C, F and H are copies of the Federal income tax returns in question and
verifies their filing with the Internal Revenue Service on March 7, 1997.</P>

<P>	The Applicant promises that in the future she will always file her tax returns on time.  (Tr.
Pg. 68).  Although her 1996 tax returns were not in question in this case, the Applicant also offered
copies of her 1996 State and Federal income tax returns that she timely filed in early April 1997. 
(See, Applicant's Exhibits K and L ). </P>

<P><U>Mitigation</U>.</P>

<P>	The Applicant's ex-employer testified that the Applicant was an above average employee and
her attendance was excellent.  She is considered trustworthy and reliable.  (Tr. Pgs. 64-66). </P>

<P>	A friend of the Applicant testified that the Applicant's failure to file her tax returns is totally
out of character for her.  She is known to be straight up, and flat footed, and does not take the
circuitous way around a problem.  (Tr. Pgs. 60-61).  </P>

<P>	Several letters of reference from friends and co-workers reveal that the Applicant is a person
of high integrity who is dependable, honest, and responsible.  (See, Applicant's Exhibit A).</P>

<P>	<CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of
Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could
raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security
clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any
case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on  own common sense.  Because
each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed
that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on
the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion J (Criminal Conduct)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	(2)	a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(5) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</P>

<P>	In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the
relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general
factors:</P>

<P>	 a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>	b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>	d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>	e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>	f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<P>	g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>	h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P> 	I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>	The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and
conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request
for access to classified information.</P>

<P>	The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period
of a person's lifer to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these
personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of
variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical
basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in
Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant
concerned.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian
workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. 
The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an
Applicant for clearance may be involved in repeated instances of criminal conduct which
demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P>

<P>	It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding
of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a
security clearance.  If such a <EM>prima facie</EM> case has been established, the burden then shifts to the
Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to
overcome or outweigh the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden
of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant him or her a
security clearance.</P>

<P>	Criminal conduct is defined as violation of federal, state or local law.  The Applicant has
violated both the State and Federal laws by repeatedly failing to file income tax returns for the
identified years.  Her behavior demonstrates irresponsibility that is unacceptable by a person who
seeks a security clearance.  Possessing a security clearance places the holder in a fiduciary
relationship with the Government.  The Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust
and confidence in a person to dutifully comply with all security regulations at all times and in all
places.  Very little confidence can be placed in a person who is not responsible enough to file income
tax returns.</P>

<P>	In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by <EM>prima facie </EM>evidence that
the Applicant failed to timely file her 1993, 1994, and 1995, State Income Tax Returns as required
by the State's Revised Statutes.  The Applicant also failed to file her 1993, 1994, and 1995 Federal
Income Tax Return in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation
or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's<EM> prima facie </EM>case against him. The
Applicant filed all of the income tax returns in question on March 7, 1997, about one month before
the Statement of Reasons was issued.  The Applicant understands that she must timely file both State
and Federal income tax returns in the future, and she is committed to doing so.  </P>

<P>	Applicant's poor judgment and irresponsibility in failing to file her income tax returns
between 1993 and 1995 must be weighed and balanced against the good judgment she has
demonstrated in March 1997, by submitting the State and Federal tax returns in question.  The
Applicant also understands that her security clearance is in jeopardy if she does not timely file her
income tax returns in the future.  The Applicant credibly testified that although her husband has in
the past been the one in the family to file the tax returns, she will now become involved in the
process to ensure that the tax returns are always filed on time in the future.  The Applicant genuinely
regrets not filing her income tax returns, and is ashamed that she has wasted the Government's time
in this effort.  The Applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that she is reformed from this aspect of her
past misconduct, and it likely will not be repeated.  She therefore satisfies the suggested mitigating
conditions.  I am convinced that the Applicant is now a reliable, trustworthy individual who can be
relied upon to properly safeguard classified information.  Accordingly, the Applicant has met her
burden of persuasion under Criteria J.</P>

<P>	On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's<EM> prima</EM> <EM>facie</EM>
case opposing her request for a continued security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports
a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph
1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></CENTER>

with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On April 3, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to -------------------- (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 21, 1997.  This case was assigned
to the undersigned on July 2, 1997, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 10, 1997.  A hearing
was held on August 19, 1997, at which the Government presented three documentary exhibits.  The
Applicant presented twelve documentary exhibits and called two witnesses to testify on her behalf. </P>

<P>The Applicant also testified on her own behalf.</P>

<P>	The official transcript was received on August 29, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant is 49 years old, and married.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a
Computer Programmer/Analyst, and she is applying for a Secret level security clearance in
connection with her employment.</P>

<P>	The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of
allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are
entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion J - Criminal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because she repeatedly violated a State's Revised Statute, a felony, and the
misdemeanor provisions of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203, by failing to file annual
income tax returns, as required. </P>

<P>	As alleged in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f., the Applicant willfully failed to file
her State Income Tax Returns for 1993, 1994, and 1995, within the time required.  Her failure to do
so was in violation of the State's Revised Statutes.</P>

<P>	As alleged in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., and 1.e., the Applicant also failed to timely
file her 1993, 1994, and 1995, Federal Income Tax Returns within the time required.  Her failure to
do so was in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant understands her responsibility to file annual State and Federal Income Tax
Returns, and she is not a tax protestor.  Although the Applicant's husband has in the past been the
one to file their income tax returns, the Applicant understands that she is responsible for filing her
State and Federal income tax returns, and for paying the required taxes. </P>

<P>	Among her excuses for not filing her tax returns on time, the Applicant explained that from
1988 until 1993 she and her husband operated a home based business, a bed and breakfast, which
they were forced to close due to a severe business turndown in their town.  After moving from their
house, they attempted to start the business again, but were unable to get it off the ground.  This
created a series of financial difficulties for them which resulted in their filing Bankruptcy.  They lost
two houses, and were forced to move twice.  In the course of their moves, things were in boxes, and
they had trouble finding the documentation that they needed.  (Tr. Pg. 32).  From 1987 until 1995,
the Applicant's husband was unemployed, and she had a number of temporary jobs. </P>

<P>	In addition, the Applicant testified that for tax years 1990, 1991, and 1992, she and her
husband used a tax relief strategy called "income averaging".  During those years, they did not file
their income tax returns until 1993, and they were issued a refund from the taxing authorities.  With
respect to their 1993, 1994, and 1995 income tax returns, the Applicant was under a good faith, but
mistaken belief, that she and her husband could continued to income average.  It was only in March
1997, that the Applicant learned from her accountant that income averaging was no longer allowed. </P>

<P>	In November 1996, the Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Investigative Service
concerning her failure to file her 1993, 1994, and 1995 State and Federal income tax returns.  The
Applicant stated at that time that she was trying to get them filed by the end of November 1996.  (Tr.
Pgs. 28-29).</P>

<P>	On January 21, 1997, the Applicant provided a sworn statement to the Defense Investigative
Service wherein she stated that her husband had been on travel and had not had time to file their tax
returns.  The Applicant further stated that she was going to file her income tax returns as soon as
possible.  (Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant testified that within a week of her interview, she
forwarded her tax information to her tax accountant to prepare her tax returns.  (Tr. Pg. 42).</P>

<P>	On March 6, 1997, the day before the Applicant actually filed her income tax returns, the
Applicant telephoned the Special Agent who had previously interviewed her to inform him that she
was filing the income tax returns in question.  The Applicant also sent copies of each of these income
tax returns to the investigator.  (Tr. Pg. 38).</P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibits D, G and I are copies of all the State income tax returns in question and
verifies their filing with the State's Department of  Revenue on March 7, 1997.</P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibits C, F and H are copies of the Federal income tax returns in question and
verifies their filing with the Internal Revenue Service on March 7, 1997.</P>

<P>	The Applicant promises that in the future she will always file her tax returns on time.  (Tr.
Pg. 68).  Although her 1996 tax returns were not in question in this case, the Applicant also offered
copies of her 1996 State and Federal income tax returns that she timely filed in early April 1997. 
(See, Applicant's Exhibits K and L ). </P>

<P><U>Mitigation</U>.</P>

<P>	The Applicant's ex-employer testified that the Applicant was an above average employee and
her attendance was excellent.  She is considered trustworthy and reliable.  (Tr. Pgs. 64-66). </P>

<P>	A friend of the Applicant testified that the Applicant's failure to file her tax returns is totally
out of character for her.  She is known to be straight up, and flat footed, and does not take the
circuitous way around a problem.  (Tr. Pgs. 60-61).  </P>

<P>	Several letters of reference from friends and co-workers reveal that the Applicant is a person
of high integrity who is dependable, honest, and responsible.  (See, Applicant's Exhibit A).</P>

<P>	<CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of
Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could
raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security
clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any
case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on  own common sense.  Because
each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed
that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on
the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion J (Criminal Conduct)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	(2)	a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(5) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</P>

<P>	In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the
relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general
factors:</P>

<P>	 a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>	b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>	d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>	g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>	h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P> 	I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>	The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and
conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request
for access to classified information.</P>

<P>	The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period
of a person's lifer to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these
personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of
variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical
basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in
Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant
concerned.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian
workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. 
The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an
Applicant for clearance may be involved in repeated instances of criminal conduct which
demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P>

<P>	It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding
of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a
security clearance.  If such a <EM>prima facie</EM> case has been established, the burden then shifts to the
Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to
overcome or outweigh the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden
of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant him or her a
security clearance.</P>

<P>	Criminal conduct is defined as violation of federal, state or local law.  The Applicant has
violated both the State and Federal laws by repeatedly failing to file income tax returns for the
identified years.  Her behavior demonstrates irresponsibility that is unacceptable by a person who
seeks a security clearance.  Possessing a security clearance places the holder in a fiduciary
relationship with the Government.  The Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust
and confidence in a person to dutifully comply with all security regulations at all times and in all
places.  Very little confidence can be placed in a person who is not responsible enough to file income
tax returns.</P>

<P>	In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by <EM>prima facie </EM>evidence that
the Applicant failed to timely file her 1993, 1994, and 1995, State Income Tax Returns as required
by the State's Revised Statutes.  The Applicant also failed to file her 1993, 1994, and 1995 Federal
Income Tax Return in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7203.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation
or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's<EM> prima facie </EM>case against him. The
Applicant filed all of the income tax returns in question on March 7, 1997, about one month before
the Statement of Reasons was issued.  The Applicant understands that she must timely file both State
and Federal income tax returns in the future, and she is committed to doing so.  </P>

<P>	Applicant's poor judgment and irresponsibility in failing to file her income tax returns
between 1993 and 1995 must be weighed and balanced against the good judgment she has
demonstrated in March 1997, by submitting the State and Federal tax returns in question.  The
Applicant also understands that her security clearance is in jeopardy if she does not timely file her
income tax returns in the future.  The Applicant credibly testified that although her husband has in
the past been the one in the family to file the tax returns, she will now become involved in the
process to ensure that the tax returns are always filed on time in the future.  The Applicant genuinely
regrets not filing her income tax returns, and is ashamed that she has wasted the Government's time
in this effort.  The Applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that she is reformed from this aspect of her
past misconduct, and it likely will not be repeated.  She therefore satisfies the suggested mitigating
conditions.  I am convinced that the Applicant is now a reliable, trustworthy individual who can be
relied upon to properly safeguard classified information.  Accordingly, the Applicant has met her
burden of persuasion under Criteria J.</P>

<P>	On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's<EM> prima</EM> <EM>facie</EM>
case opposing her request for a continued security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports
a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph
1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by
Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>			Paragraph 1:  For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			    Subpara.   1.a.:  For the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DECISION</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
