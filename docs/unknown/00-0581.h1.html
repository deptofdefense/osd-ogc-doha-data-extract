<P>    Applicant's conduct raises security concerns over his finances as he admitted five debts which total over $10,000.  While he claimed in December 2000 to have 
resolved these debts though bankruptcy, he failed to  submit  any evidence of having done so. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on November 17, 2000.  The SOR detailed reasons why 
the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.<A HREF="00-0581.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  (Item 1)  The SOR alleges specific concerns in paragraph 1 over financial issues (Guideline F).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer 
notarized on December 29, 2000, where he admitted paragraphs 1.a. though 1.e. but explained that he had filed for bankruptcy; however, he submitted no supporting 
documentation.  He requested a determination on the record.  (Item 3)</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel; on February 7, 2001, he prepared the File of Relevant Material (FORM) for the Applicant's review.  Department 
Counsel advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the 
right to be represented by counsel.  A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on February 7, 2001, and again notified the Applicant that he had 
30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the FORM on 
arch 20,   2001.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, he did not submit any response before the deadline of April 19, 2001.  On May 7,  2001, the case was assigned to me.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>     </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 24 years old employee of a defense contractor in State #1 where he has worked since June 1996; he worked in other civilian jobs from 1995 to 1996.  He 
applied for a security clearance in June1999 by completing a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  He reported he was granted a Secret security 
clearance in March 1998.  He graduated from high school in June 1995.  (Items 4, 5)  He has never married. (Item 4)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>While his security clearance application reveals no financial issues, a September 1999 Report of Credit revealed several delinquencies.  (Items 4, 7)  In September 1999, 
Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) and said that he had resolved one debt six months prior to a financial institution by paying $60 on a 
$120 debt.  His personal financial statement of September 1999 showed net monthly income from his salary and rental income of $1,452; expenses of $790; monthly debt 
payments of $479 with a remainder of $183 monthly.   He has real estate assets of $26,000 and further explained the following financial indebtedness (Items 7, 8):</P> 
 
<P>   His debt to Creditor #1 for over $10,000 was for an automobile he financed on installment in December 1995; in May 1998 he was involved in an accident where the 
vehicle was damaged and was later sold by Creditor #1.  He did not learn until September 1999 that he owed a balance of over $9,000 as his vehicle insurance had 
lapsed, but he was to check to see if this financial institution had coverage.  He said he would develop a payment plan to resolve the debt if he owes it but had not done so 
by July 2000.  Two credit reports showed a charged off account of $9,505.   (SOR 1.a.)  (Items 6, 7, 8)</P> 
 
<P>   His debt of $320 on two accounts with Creditor #2 to a fire department was also a result of the accident in May 1998 as he needed ambulance and helicopter 
ambulance services.  He agreed to contact the credit bureau and make arrangements for payment but had not done so by July 2000.  (SOR 1.b.)  (Items 6, 7, 8)</P> 
 
<P> His personal financial statement of September 1999 showed an active account with Creditor #3 to whom he owed $2,000 and was making monthly payments of $100. 
(SOR 1.c.)</P> 
 
<P> His personal financial statement of September 1999 showed an active account with Creditor #4 to whom he owed $1,000 and was making monthly payments of $100 
and where the credit report showed he paid as agreed. A credit report of July 2000 showed the account closed by credit grantor with a balance of $159.  (SOR 1.d.)  
(Items 6, 7, 8)</P> 
 
<P> A credit report of July 2000 showed a charged off account with Creditor #5 to whom he owed $84. (SOR 1.e.)  (Item 6)</P> 
 
<P>In July 2002 he responded to Financial Interrogatories where he explained he had lost his roommate and was having trouble meeting his regular monthly expenses of over 
$1,600 on his monthly income of $1,260.  He had paid one creditor in full but had not resolved his debts with Creditors #1 or #2 due to lack of funds.  (Item 6)</P> 
 
<P>In an Answer notarized on December 29, 2000, he admitted paragraphs 1.a. though 1.e., but explained that he had filed for bankruptcy. However, he submitted no 
supporting documentation.  His regular monthly expenses at that time were $620 (with no figures provided for food, utilities, etc.) and with a weekly income reported of 
$480 or approximately $2,000 monthly income.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in 
evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations; </P> 
 
<P>(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive 
Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criterion F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government raised security concerns over Applicant's financial  problems: he has (1) a history of financial problems and (3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts  (SOR 1.a.-1.g.)  While he claimed to have resolved his financial situation by having filed for bankruptcy, he provided no details of when he did file or the debts 
discharged.  While the largest debt for his car seems to have been written off by the creditor and while the other debts are not large, he had the responsibility to present 
evidence of his steps to mitigate these issues.   In December 2000 he stated he had reduced his expenses and increased his income; yet he presented no further evidence 
that he had made good faith efforts to resolve these past financial issues.  In response to the FORM he presented no new evidence that these debts had been resolved by 
bankruptcy nor any other evidence that he had addressed his debts issues in a way to demonstrate that they are now under control.  Thus, I conclude he has not met the 
conditions (MC<A HREF="00-0581.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>) that mitigate these security concerns.   After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against 
Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I 
make the following formal findings:</P>

<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:     Against Applicant</P>

</P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.</P>
