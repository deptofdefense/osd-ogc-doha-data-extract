  Applicant's statements about his intent or state of mind are relevant evidence, but they are not binding on the Administrative Judge.  The Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security questionnaire in November 1998 is sustainable.  In a security clearance adjudication, a Judge can find that an  applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal charges were dropped.  Applicant's history of criminal conduct and his falsification of a security  questionnaire provide a rational basis for Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a decision, dated February 19, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's 
decision.</P> 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred with respect to certain factual findings; and (2) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred by making an adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 17, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  A hearing was held on January 9, 2002.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated February 19, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred with respect to certain factual findings</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Administrative Judge's findings 
concerning falsification and one of the Judge's findings about his past criminal history.</P> 
<P>(a) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Falsification</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant falsified a security questionnaire in November 1998 by: (a) not disclosing that he had been 
arrested or charged in March 1994, September 1994, and April 1998; and (b) not disclosing that he had used crystal methamphetamine as late as 1993.  The 
Judge specifically considered Applicant's explanations for his failure to disclose that information, assessed the credibility of Applicant's testimony, and 
concluded Applicant's explanations were not credible.  On appeal, Applicant argues he did not intentionally omit or falsify information, and that he had various 
reasons for completing the security questionnaire the way he did.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant has failed to demonstrate the 
Judge erred.</P> 
<P>During the proceedings below, Applicant denied any intent to falsify the security questionnaire he completed in November 1998.  Applicant's statements about 
his intent or state of mind were relevant and material evidence, but they were not binding on the Administrative Judge.  The Judge had to consider and weigh 
the written and testimonial statements made by Applicant concerning his intent or state of mind in light of the record evidence as a whole, as well as the Judge's 
assessment of the credibility of Applicant's hearing testimony.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0044 (December 22, 2000) at p. 3.  Considering the record as a 
whole, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to reject Applicant's explanations and conclude that Applicant had intentionally tried to 
conceal the full extent of his criminal record, as well as his use of crystal methamphetamine as late as 1993.  Applicant's appeal arguments fail to persuade the 
Board that the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, or that the Judge's findings of falsification are not 
sustainable on the record evidence in this case.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1 (setting forth Board's standard for reviewing a 
Judge's factual findings).</P> 
<P>(b) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Applicant's criminal history</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found Applicant "has a long history of criminal conduct" that began in 1988 and continued to 
November 1998.  On appeal, Applicant does not challenge most of the Judge's findings about his past criminal conduct.  However, Applicant argues: (i) the 
1998 incident involved a false accusation made against him by the alleged victim; (ii) the criminal charge against him was dropped; and (iii) his criminal history 
only covers the period 1988-1994.  The Board construes Applicant's arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge erred by finding Applicant's criminal 
history continued to November 1998.</P> 
<P>In a security clearance adjudication, an Administrative Judge can find that an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal charges were 
dropped.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0119 (September 13, 1999) at p. 2 ("[T]he fact that criminal charges were dropped, dismissed, or resulted in an acquittal 
does not preclude an Administrative Judge from finding an applicant engaged in the conduct underlying those criminal charges.").  Considering the record as a 
whole, the Judge had sufficient evidence to find that the 1998 incident involved criminal conduct by Applicant even though the criminal charge was later 
dropped.  Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by making an adverse security clearance decision</SPAN>.  Applicant also argues: (a) he has changed his life for the better; 
(b) he has demonstrated his trustworthiness through hard work and changing his lifestyle for the better; (c) he has no intention of "stepping backward from a 
good life I've worked long and hard to rebuild"; and (d) he would never misuse a security clearance.  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue 
of whether the Administrative Judge erred by making an adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
<P>Applicant's ability to refer to favorable record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, and decide whether the 
favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's appeal arguments do not persuade the Board that the Judge weighed the 
record evidence in this case in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's  falsification and his past criminal history are sustainable.  Those 
findings provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.  The federal government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  The federal 
government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such 
information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0601 (September 21, 2001) at p. 3.  Given the 
totality of the record evidence in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's past criminal record and 
his falsification of a security questionnaire in November 1998 reflect adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness and warrant an adverse security 
clearance decision.</P>
