<P>The Applicant was less than candid as to his past drug abuse on his May 1999 Security Clearance Application (SCA).  He said "No" as to past drug use, when 
in fact he had used marijuana on an at times weekly basis during the period May 1992~August 1994.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 7, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on November 6, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on February 27, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on March 4, 2003, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution 
on April 16, 2003.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's personal conduct militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant 
denies the wilful falsification aspect of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 49 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  In answering question 24 on his May 1999 SCA, the Applicant failed to list a 1980 charge for Suspected Possession of a Controlled Substance (marijuana) 
(Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at page 7).  He did, however, list a 1993 charge for "DUI" (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant avers, credibly, that "I had the phrase 'The Last 7 
Years' stuck in my brain and that is how I answered" (GX 3 at page 1).  This is believable, and I find no wilful falsification here.  This subparagraph is found 
for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  In answering question 27 on the same May 1999 SCA, the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to disclose any of his past marijuana abuse (GX 4 at 
page 7).  The Applicant "had used marijuana for approx(<EM>sic</EM>) 20 year(<EM>sic</EM>) ages 21~41 on a monthly, sometimes weekly basis" (GX 5 at page 1).  He avers that he 
"simply forgot" (GX 3 at page 1).  This is simply not believable.  In answer to the prior question, he avers he had the last seven years stuck in his brain (<EM>id</EM>).  
Question 27 asks about drug usage, to include marijuana, "in the last 7 years."  If the Applicant did, in fact, have seven years stuck in his brain, he clearly 
should have divulged that last two years of his weekly to monthly marijuana abuse.  This subparagraph is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant 
and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline E (personal conduct), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the 
same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was not truthful as to his past drug abuse when he filled out his SCA in May of 1999.  The second disqualifying condition under Personal 
Conduct is therefore applicable.  It was only more than three years later, when the Applicant executed a sworn statement in October of 2002, that his past drug 
abuse was divulged.  This is clearly not a prompt, good faith effort to correct his falsification; and as such, the third mitigating condition does not apply.  The 
Applicant's lack of candor is clearly of security significance; and as such, Guideline E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his personal conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline E, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline E.</SPAN></P>
