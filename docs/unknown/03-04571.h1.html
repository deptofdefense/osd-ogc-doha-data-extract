<P>When he was 18 years old, Applicant purchased cocaine so he could sell it for a profit.  He was arrested and eventually pled guilty to attempted possession of 
cocaine for the purpose of selling it.  He also used marijuana a few times, the last time being in 2002, the night before he was sentenced on the cocaine charge.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 25 March 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-04571.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 13 April 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me on 6 January 2005.  On 9 February 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 18 February 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 24-year-old manufacturing specialist for a defense contractor.  He and his girlfriend have a daughter who is less than one year old.  They are 
buying a house and plan to be living together as a family this year.  He is well respected by his supervisors and colleagues as a dedicated and reliable worker.  </P> 
<P>Applicant used marijuana in 1992 or 1993 when he was in junior high school.  His father discovered the use and disciplined Applicant.  Applicant also used 
cocaine once in 1993.  Applicant was arrested in June 1997 and July 1999 for consuming alcohol while he was a minor.  Applicant was acquitted of the 1997 
offense and the 1999 offense was dismissed after Applicant completed a court ordered substance abuse course. </P> 
<P>On 2 July 1999, Applicant was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a friend.  The police stopped the vehicle after smelling the marijuana the driver was smoking.  
The police found a bag of cocaine Applicant tried to ditch.  Applicant had purchased the cocaine so he could sell it and make a profit.  The police arrested 
Applicant.  At the station, they found Applicant trying to get rid of a baggie of marijuana that had been in his underwear.  He was charged with possession of 
cocaine for sale, unlawful possession of marijuana, and possession of a handgun during a narcotics offense.  The charges were dismissed on 21 July 1999, but 
re-filed in May 2002.  Applicant pled guilty to attempted possession of a narcotic drug for sale.  On 11 August 2002, the night before he was sentenced, 
Applicant used marijuana.  He was placed on probation for two years, ordered to complete outpatient treatment, and pay a fine.  Applicant successfully 
completed a substance abuse program.  His probation was terminated four months early because he had completed all requirements of the program.  </P> 
<P>In October 2001, Applicant was indicted for two counts of armed robbery, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly 
weapon.  An eye witness identified Applicant from a photo array as the individual holding a shotgun during one of the robberies.  When she saw Applicant at 
the arraignment, she notified police that she had selected the wrong individual and then pointed out another who had wielded the shotgun.  At the request of the 
state, the judge dismissed the charges without prejudice on 6 November 2001.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H-Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of attempted possession of a narcotic drug (cocaine) for sale (&para; 1.a); attended substance abuse counseling 
(&para; 1.b), used marijuana in 1992 or 1993 and in August 2002 (&para; 1.c), used cocaine in 1993 (&para; 1.d), and sold cocaine for profit (&para; 1.e).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant all the 
allegations, except the one in &para; 1.e.  The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline H</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant abused drugs by using 
marijuana and cocaine.  DC E2.A8.1.2.1.  He also illegally possessed marijuana and illegally purchased cocaine.  DC E2.A8.1.2.2.  Most disturbing is his use of 
marijuana on the eve of his sentencing for the attempted possession of cocaine for purpose of selling it.  Nevertheless, I conclude Applicant's drug abuse is not 
recent.  MC E2.A8.1.3.1.  His last use of illegal drugs was almost three years ago.  Applicant has a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.  
E2.A8.1.3.3.  He fully understands that a recurrence of drug abuse will likely result in the loss of his clearance and perhaps his job.  After considering all of the 
evidence, including Applicant's young age at the time of the offenses, his acceptance of responsibility, and his personal growth and maturity, I find for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of attempted possession of a narcotic drug (cocaine) for sale (&para; 2.a); indicted on 3 October 2001 for armed 
robbery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (&para; 2.b); arrested in July 1999 and charged with consuming alcohol as a minor (&para; 2.c), and arrested in June 
1997 and charged with consuming alcohol as a minor (&para; 2.d).  Applicant admits each of the allegations, but denies he participated in the armed robbery and 
aggravated assault that is the subject of &para; 2.b.  Answer; Tr. 9.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P>

offense-possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute<A HREF="03-04571.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>-and multiple lesser offenses-use of marijuana and cocaine and consuming alcohol while a minor.  
DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  Applicant did not participate in the October 2001 incident that led to his indictment for armed robbery, kidnapping, and aggravated assault. 
Applicant's criminal behavior is not recent-the last offense (his use of marijuana on the even of his sentencing) being almost three years ago (MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1) and there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC E2.A10.1.3.1).  Applicant's offenses were committed when he was a young man.  He 
has matured significantly in the last few years.  He is open and honest about his past and accepts full responsibility for his transgressions.  Applicant 
understands that future misconduct will not be tolerated and will most likely result in the revocation of his security clearance and termination from his 
employment.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
