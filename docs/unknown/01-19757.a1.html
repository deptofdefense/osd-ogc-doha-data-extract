  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  In deciding whether an Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence the Board is limited to considering the record evidence that was before the Judge when he decided Applicant's case.  Harmless factual error by the Judge does  not warrant remand or reversal.  Applicant's significant federal income tax delinquency provides a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about her  security eligibility.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge James A. Young issued a decision, dated December 17, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant had failed to satisfy two liens filed for 
unpaid taxes; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons 
that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August 19, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).  Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which she indicated "I don't feel I need a hearing.  I think a decision can be made 
without a hearing."  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.  A copy of the FORM was given to Applicant, who submitted a response to it.  The 
case was then assigned to the Administrative Judge for disposition.  The Judge issued a written decision, dated December 17, 2002, in which he concluded it is 
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from 
the Judge's unfavorable decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant had failed to satisfy two liens filed for unpaid taxes</SPAN>.  Applicant challenges the 
Administrative Judge's findings that she has not satisfied liens filed in 1990 and 1991 for unpaid taxes (subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c).  Applicant contends she has 
paid the taxes and the liens were removed.  In support of this claim of error, Applicant: (a) has submitted documentation from a county recorder's office; and 
(b) argues that Department Counsel stated, in the FORM, that Applicant had paid off the tax liens.</P> 
 
<P>The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  In deciding whether the Administrative Judge's 
findings of fact are supported by substantial record evidence (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1), the Board is limited to considering 
the record evidence that was before the Judge when he decided Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the Board cannot find that the Judge made an erroneous factual 
finding based on new evidence submitted on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>In responding to the SOR, Applicant stated she had resolved the tax liens in September 2001 and submitted documentation in support of her claim.  In 
responding to the FORM, Applicant stated that she had paid her back taxes and had the liens filed against her removed.  Considering the  documentation 
submitted by Applicant with her answer to the SOR and Department Counsel's concession in the FORM that Applicant had paid off the tax liens, the 
Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant did not satisfy the tax liens covered by SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c.  <EM>See </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.</P> 
 
<P>Although the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant had not paid and satisfied the tax liens covered by SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, that error 
was harmless under the particular facts of this case.  The debts covered by SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c total $169.59, while the debt covered by SOR 
subparagraph 1f is approximately $56,900.  Considering the large disparity between the combined value of the debts covered by subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c and 
the value of the one debt covered by SOR subparagraph 1.f, it is highly unlikely that the Judge's adverse formal findings about SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c 
were decisive or pivotal to his overall adverse conclusions under Guideline F.  Accordingly, even though the Board concludes that the Judge should have 
entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, such favorable formal findings do not warrant remand or reversal 
of this case.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine).</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge made 
findings and reached conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties as follows: (a) Applicant and her husband had a federal income tax 
delinquency for tax years 1990-1994 which, as of October 2002, had grown to $56,898.01 (including penalties and interest); (b) Applicant has made an offer of 
compromise to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (c) the IRS had not replied to the offer of compromise as of the time Applicant responded to the FORM; (d) 
Applicant's history of not meeting her financial obligations in a timely manner since 1985 falls under Guideline F; (e) Applicant's efforts to satisfy her debts 
were made in good-faith; and (f) Applicant's efforts to address her financial difficulties were not sufficient to rebut, explain, or mitigate the security concerns 
raised under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about her federal income tax delinquency.  However, Applicant: (i) refers to her 
offer of compromise to the IRS; (ii) attaches to her appeal brief a letter from the IRS acknowledging receipt of her offer of compromise; and (iii) states that the 
IRS has told her that an IRS examiner has not yet been assigned to her case.  The Board construes Applicant's statements as raising the issue of whether the 
Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>As noted earlier in this decision, the Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Even if the Board had the authority to consider new evidence on appeal, 
Applicant's appeal statements about the status of her offer of compromise do not demonstrate factual or legal error by the Administrative Judge, nor do they 
provide any legitimate basis for the Board to remand the case to the Judge.  The Judge specifically found that Applicant had made an offer of compromise to the 
IRS and that the IRS had not acted on it as of the time Applicant responded to the FORM.  Applicant's proffer of new evidence adds nothing material to her 
case: (1) it does not demonstrate the Judge's findings and conclusions about her federal income tax delinquency are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law 
based on the record evidence properly before him; and (2) it does not demonstrate any legitimate reason why the Board should remand the case to the Judge to 
reopen the record and consider Applicant's new evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility based on consideration of the 
person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  Applicant's history of financial difficulties 
provides a sufficient basis for the Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0454 
(February 7, 1997) at p. 2 (discussing negative security significance of a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring financial difficulties).  Given the 
undisputed evidence that Applicant still has not satisfied her federal income tax delinquency, the Judge's adverse security clearance decision is not arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below that warrants remand or reversal.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security 
clearance decision.</P>
