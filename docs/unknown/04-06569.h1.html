</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a naturalized United States citizen who was born in Ukraine.  Concerns were raised because her husband and  paternal grandparents are citizens of 
Russia residing in the United States.  In addition, concerns were raised due to the status of her maternal grandmother, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and step-daughter as citizens of and residing in Russia.  Her maternal grandmother has passed away.  She has little to no contact with her husband's relatives.  All of her 
immediate relatives reside in the United States. Foreign preference concerns have been mitigated. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.</P> 
<P>In a sworn statement dated April 22, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  She initially requested a hearing and the case was assigned to another 
administrative judge on July 19, 2005.  On July 25, 2005, Applicant submitted a request to have her case decided on the written record.  Department Counsel 
submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on August 19, 2005. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on August 23, 2005, and received on 
September 8, 2005. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not 
respond.  The case was assigned to me on December 30, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline B, pertaining to foreign influence, with the respective DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair 
and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the 
Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) 
the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against </P> 
<P>him.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The decision to 
deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations 
could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contact with citizens of other countries 
or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the foreign influence concern, a potentially disqualifying condition is raised 
with respect to Applicant's husband and her paternal grandparents since they are citizens of Russia residing in the United States.  As such, Foreign Influence 
Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1: (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude the Government has not established a prima facie case under foreign influence with respect to Applicant's  maternal grandmother, step-daughter, 
brother-in-law and sister-in-law.  Based on the record evidence, it is clear  that Applicant had close ties of affection with her maternal grandmother.  She visited 
her on two occasions in Russia.  However, her grandmother has passed away which makes the foreign influence concern with respect to her grandmother a 
moot point.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not have close ties of affection or a sense of obligation to her step-daughter, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.  They are citizens of and reside in 
Russia but they are not considered immediate relatives within the definition of FI DC 1.  Although the DOHA Appeal Board has stated that there is a rebuttable 
presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to the immediate family members of the person's spouse,<A HREF="04-06569.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Applicant has never met her 
brother-in-law or sister-in-law.  She has never talked to them on the telephone.  Her husband has limited contact with his siblings.  He calls them once a year.  
She has never met her step-daughter.  She has spoken with her on the phone only once.  Considering her limited contact with her husband's relatives, I conclude 
Applicant has rebutted the presumption that she has ties of affection or a sense of obligation to her husband's relatives who are citizens of and reside in Russia.  
I find for the Applicant with respect to &para;&para; 1.b of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A foreign influence security concern remains with respect to SOR &para;&para;s 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. The foreign influence concern can be mitigated.  Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1: (<EM>A determination that immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), 
cohabitant, or associates) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between the loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>) is applicable to this case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the record evidence before me, I conclude Applicant's husband and paternal grandparents are not agents of a foreign power.  Her husband is a self-employed artist and set designer. Her paternal grandparents reside in the United States and became United States citizens. Her paternal grandmother passed 
away in 2004.  Her husband is a permanent resident of the United States who has applied for United States citizenship.  Because her husband and grandfather 
reside in the United States, it is unlikely they are in a position to exploited by a foreign power in a way which could force Applicant to choose between the 
loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given her limited contact with her husband's foreign relations, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3: (<EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent) </EM>applies with respect to her in-laws and step-daughter.  A concern was alleged pertaining to trips Applicant made to Russia; once in 1998 and five 
times in 2000.  The 1998 trip was a personal visit to see her maternal grandmother.  The five trips in 2000 were business-related. She did take the opportunity to 
visit her maternal grandmother during one of these business trips.  She has not traveled to Russia since 2000.  Applicant's foreign travel does not raise a security 
concern.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has resided in the United States since 1990.  She became a United States citizen in 1996.  Her parents and paternal grandparents immigrated to the 
United States and became United States citizens.  Her son was born in the United States.  Her family's financial interests are in the United States.  Her 
substantial ties to and preference for the United States lead me to conclude she can be trusted to place her obligation to the United States government ahead of 
any sense of obligation to her husband's relatives residing in Russia due to her minimal contact with them. She no longer has immediate relatives residing in 
Russia.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, common 
sense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a 
careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, 
omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying 
sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. I find Applicant has  mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
