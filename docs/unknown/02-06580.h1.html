</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On July 16, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 14, 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 27, 2003.  On November 18, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 
December 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  Applicant admits both allegations.  His admissions are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time of his hearing, Applicant was 61 years of age, married, and the father of an adult child.  In the 1960s he served for four years in the Marine Corps.  
He was a law enforcement officer for 22 years before retiring in 1992.  After retirement he was unemployed for several months.  He worked on carpentry and 
repair projects for family and friends.  In February 1993 he took a full-time job in the quality control and parts division of an automobile dealership, where he 
worked for approximately three years.  He was unemployed for a four-month period in 1996, and then took a job as a truck driver and carpenter with a 
company, where he worked for over three years.  He was unemployed for about nine months in 1999/2000.  In 2000 he took a position as a security guard with a 
government contractor.  In June 2000 he completed an application for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 21, 1999 Applicant was hospitalized for delirium tremens.  He remained in the hospital for two weeks.  On January 4, 2000, he became agitated 
and combative, and, as a part of his treatment, he was evaluated the next day by a staff psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant as suffering from 
major depression, a psychotic mental disorder, known as alcoholic encephalopathy,<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> alcohol dependence, alcoholic peripheral neuropathy,<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and alcoholic liver 
disease.<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits to a long history of heavy drinking.  After his retirement as a law enforcement officer and before he went to work for the automobile 
dealership in 1993, he drank, by his estimation, one half pint of hard liquor a day.  Applicant's alcohol consumption increased to over a pint of hard liquor a day 
when he was unemployed in 1999.  During this time, he was depressed, worried about his health problems and those of his wife, and thinking a lot about a time 
when he was a policeman and, in self protection, either he or his partner shot and killed a suspect.<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated he began drinking beer when he was in the military and did not begin to drink heavily until the 1980s.  He customarily drank at home alone or 
with his wife, usually in the evening.  Either he or his wife purchased the alcohol he drank.  He continues to drink, although his physician has advised him to 
abstain permanently from alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never been referred for alcohol treatment or advised to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.  He has not been arrested for driving under the 
influence of alcohol, nor has he been reported for alcohol-related incidents at work.  As a security guard, charged with protecting a federal workplace, he is 
authorized to carry a firearm while on duty.  He is aware that his use of alcohol has seriously damaged his health.  He stated his most recent use of alcohol 
occurred two days before his hearing, on November 16, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Exhibit E was a letter from his supervisor attesting that he was an exemplary employee, always prepared and punctual, who performed his duties at 
the highest level of competence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Exhibit D was a notarized one-page letter, dated 11-26-02, on typed letterhead.  The letter, signed by Applicant's physician, reads, in its entirety, as 
follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">HE INDICATED THAT SOME TIME DRINKS ONE OR TWO BEERS</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged in &para; 1.a. that Applicant had been hospitalized and diagnosed with alcoholic encephalopathy, alcohol dependence, alcoholic 
peripheral neuropathy, and alcoholic liver disease.  DOHA alleged in &para; 1.b. that despite these diagnoses, Applicant continued to drink beer, on occasion, up to 
November 26, 2002.  Applicant admits both allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G.  Security concerns under &para;&para; E2.A7.1.2.3 and E2.A7.1.2.5. 
are raised by Applicant's admissions and the record evidence.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, and failure to control impulses, thereby increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent and as suffering from physical and mental disabilities brought on by excessive use of alcohol, thus raising a 
security concern under &para; E2.A7.1.2.3 of Guideline G.  He acknowledges habitual excessive alcohol consumption over many years that has impaired his 
judgment and physical functioning, raising a security concern under&para; E2.A7.1.2.5. of Guideline G.  While Applicant never sought and was never directed to 
undertake treatment for his alcohol dependence, the consequences of his excessive consumption of alcohol are reflected in the medical diagnoses he received in 
January 2000.  He has been advised to abstain form drinking alcohol by his physician, and yet he continues to drink.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern (&para; 
E2.A7.1.3.1), the problem with excessive alcohol consumption occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem (&para; E2.A7.1.3.2.), 
and if Applicant shows positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (&para; E2.A7.1.3.3.).  Applicant's disqualifying conduct could also be mitigated if, 
following a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, he successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare 
requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, 
and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  (&para; E2.A7.1.3.4.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's dependence on alcohol indicates a lifestyle and pattern of behavior.  He continues to use alcohol despite his physician's counsel to abstain, and he 
has not sought inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation or treatment.  While the record does not indicate alcohol-related incidents at work or away from work, the 
diagnoses he received in January 2000 are the result of prolonged and episodic excessive use of alcohol, leading to the commonsense conclusion that mitigating 
factors E2.A7.1.3.1, E2.A7.1.3.2, E2.A7.1.3.3 and E2.A7.1.3.4 do not apply to Applicant's case.<A HREF="02-06580.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board states that an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant's security worthiness, 
"must consider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>."  I 
have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive, and I conclude that Applicant 
has not successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the Guideline G allegations in the SOR are 
concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant</SPAN></P>

clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome includes two separate sets of symptoms.  Wernicke's encephalopathy involves damages to multiple nerves in both the central 
nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system in the rest of the body.  Korsakoff syndrome, or Korsakoff psychosis, tends to develop

significance of alcohol abuse that occurs in the absence of a diagnosis of alcoholism or alcohol dependence.  Nothing in the Directive precludes consideration 
of the security significance of episodic alcohol abuse that falls short of habitual or binge drinking.  Nothing in the Directive precludes consideration of the
