<P>Applicant's dual citizenship has been mitigated by his renunciation of his foreign citizenship and his act of surrendering his foreign passport to the appropriate 
foreign consulate.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 6, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 13, 2002, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned 
to the undersigned on May 28, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 20, 2002.  The hearing was held on July 17, 2002, at which the Government 
presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The Applicant also submitted a Post-Hearing 
exhibit identified as Post-Hearing Exhibit A.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on July 25, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, clarifying "the application of Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  (Hereafter referred to as the 
oney Memorandum).  Attached to the Applicant's SOR was a copy of the Money Memorandum.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, his response to the SOR, his testimony at the hearing, his documents, and the 
Government's documents.  The Applicant is 29 years of age, married, and is employed as an Engineer for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Australia in 1973 to parents that were United States citizens,   who were at that time, living in Australia for employment 
opportunities.  By virtue of the fact that the Applicant was born in Australia, he considered himself a dual citizen.  For the first fifteen months of his life, the 
Applicant lived in Australia.  In late 1974, his family moved to the United States where he has lived ever since.  The Applicant is married and has two children.  
They are all native born United States citizens.  He owns a home in the United States, and has no immediate family that resides in Australia.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, two years before applying for employment with the defense department, the Applicant applied for an Australian passport simply for sentimental 
reasons, because he could.  He never intended to use the Australian passport.  (Tr. p. 30).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon receiving the SOR and its attachments, the Applicant was appraised of the Money Memorandum, and the fact that maintaining his Australian passport 
could have adverse security consequences.  He immediately surrendered it to the Australian consulate.  (<EM>See</EM>, Tr. p. 23 and Applicant's Exhibits A, B and C).  
The Applicant also expressed a willingness to renounce his Australian citizenship.  On July 17, 2002, the Applicant voluntarily and willingly renounced his 
Australian citizenship.  To renounce his Australian citizenship, he was required to file a form entitled "Declaration of Renunciation of Australian Citizenship" 
with the Australian Consulate.  A copy of this form is in the record. (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Post-Hearing Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has no financial or property interest in Australia, and has never voted in an Australian election.  He has never received any benefit, economic or 
otherwise from Australia.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation from his section manager and other professional colleagues collectively indicate that the Applicant is a dedicated employee, a hard 
worker and a good father.  He is considered extremely reliable and dependable, and an asset to their company.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Exhibit E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.  The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that, although the Government established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, the Applicant no longer holds dual 
citizenship and thus that fact no longer has a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The mere possession of a foreign passport, and dual citizenship status, raises legitimate questions as to whether an Applicant can be counted upon to place the 
interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My interpretation of the Money memorandum is that, in all cases involving an Applicant who has possessed or used a foreign passport, Guideline C requires a 
denial of the security clearance request unless the Applicant offers credible evidence that he (1) has obtained official approval for its use from the appropriate 
United States Government agency, or (2) has surrendered the passport.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon notification of the Money memorandum, and its ramifications, the Applicant has chosen to voluntarily and willingly relinquish his Australian passport, 
and to renounce his Australian citizenship.  He is no longer a dual citizen.  He is a United States citizen by birth who has made the United States his permanent 
home.  He has lived in the United States since he was fifteen months old, and has never returned to Australia.  He obtained his education in the United States 
and has always been employed in the United States.  He intends to reside in the United States for the duration of his life.  I am convinced that the Applicant 
clearly prefers the United States over Australia.  He has demonstrated his commitment by surrendering his foreign passport, and renouncing his foreign 
citizenship.  Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, Applicant's request for a security clearance should be granted under Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his foreign preference.  The Applicant has met the mitigating 
conditions of Guideline C and of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guideline C.</SPAN></P>
