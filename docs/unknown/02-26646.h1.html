<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 29, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons under
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant submitted a signed statement dated October 12, 2003, and notarized.  She admitted
the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  She requested his case be decided on
the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On January 21, 2004, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant.  He was given 
the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant did not file a response to the FORM within the scheduled due date of March 4, 2004.  The
case was assigned to me on March 22, 2004.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>					<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make
the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is 47 years old.  Applicant is married and has two children. She is currently
employed with a defense contractor. (Item 4 at 1 to 3)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant and her husband had a wallboard business.  It failed, and as president of the
company she was responsible for handling the business debts.  She filed bankruptcy in March 2002
and was discharged of $242,570.05 in debt from the business on June 24, 2002.  The strain of the
failing business put pressure on her marriage and she separated from her husband.  They have
reunited. (Items 3, 5, 7, and 8)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) placed two liens on Applicant's real estate, her family
home, in February and March 2001, to recover unpaid payroll taxes owed by Applicant from her
failed business. Applicant attempted to sell her home to pay the debts, but the IRS would not consent
and release its liens.  The sale ceased and never closed.  Applicant was trying, as of October 2003,
to apply for an offer in compromise on those debts for unpaid business payroll taxes.  The total
delinquent debt owed to the IRS is $62,758.  The IRS is the presumed lienor, although Applicant's
statement refers to her home state taxing authorities as holding the liens and being the party with
whom she is seeking a compromise. (Item 3; Item 6 at 7)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant answered "No" to Questions 36( Liens filed against the Applicant in the past seven
years), Question 38 (delinquent debts more than 180 days in the past seven years), and Question 39
(delinquent debts of more than 90 days duration at any time).  Applicant says she did not know about
the liens until she attempted to sell the house in July 2002.  Applicant completed her security
clearance application (SCA) on April 9, 2002.  Applicant's interrogatories state she had an agreement
with the IRS to allow the house to be sold and the liens satisfied, but the IRS backed out of the deal
at the last moment, and the sale was not consummated. (Item 3 at 2; Item 4 at 7 and 8; Item 7 at 2)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant sought an Order from the bankruptcy court to allow her home to be sold free of the
judgment liens placed on the property by two creditors.  The liens were to attach to the proceeds of
the sale in their order of priority.  There was one unnamed objection to that Order, which was entered
on February 20, 2003 by the Bankrupty Court which had jurisdiction over Applicant's bankruptcy
case.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S.
518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id</EM>. At
527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgement, as well
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or.
12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security
clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative
guidelines that must be carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the
overall common sense determination required. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>		(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </P>

<P>				(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable
participation; </P>

<P>		(3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; </P>

<P>		(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; </P>

<P>		(5) the voluntariness of participation; </P>

<P>		(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; </P>

<P>		(7) the motivation for the conduct; </P>

<P>		(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and </P>

<P>				(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of
Enclosure 2). </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be
assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in
every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be
sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available
information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other
behavior specified in the Guidelines.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the
personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant
from being eligible for access to classified information.  See <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is
required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling
classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a
<EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of
demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to
classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the
national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,
on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec . Or. 12968 Section 3.1(b).</P>

guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I conclude that under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) the Government proved its case. 
Therefore, the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and
DC 2 (<EM>an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply.  Applicant's delinquent financial debts
are sizable and were when she completed the SCA.  She filed bankruptcy the month prior to the
completion of the SCA, and revealed that action in answer to Question 33 on her SCA.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	There are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable here to the IRS liens.  The filing of
bankruptcy, a remedy allowed under Federal law and the U.S. Constitution, is a legitimate method
of resolving debts.  A compromise of tax debt is also, but Applicant has had since at least July 2002
when she made her statement to an investigator to resolve the lien issue.  Therefore, I find against
Applicant on this guideline.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Regarding Guideline E (Personal Conduct), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude the Government proved its case.  T</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he
SOR alleges Applicant falsified material facts on the SCA, Question 38 (delinquencies over 180 days)
and Question 39 (delinquencies over 90 days) by answering "no" to both questions.  DC 2 (<EM>the
deliberate, omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal
security questionnaire or similar form used to determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness</EM>) applies to this case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I conclude there are no MC which apply to these facts.  Applicant, who was the presidnet of
the business which owed the payroll taxes, had to know they were unpaid and the IRS would seek
payment.  She also would have received notice in 2001 of the liens being filed so that she could
arrange payment and have the liens satisfied, thereby removing them from her credit record and her
property.  She also knew the payroll tax debts were more than 90 days delinquent.  Therefore, I find
against Applicant under this guideline.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
