<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 11 August 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-22572.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant admitted, with explanation, each of the SOR allegations in a writing notarized on 10 September 2003 and 
elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  Applicant filed an amended Answer on 20 February 2004 in which he denied each of the allegations 
but gave the same explanation.  The case was assigned to me on 12 December 2003.  On 6 April 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 15 April 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Without objection from Applicant, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the date in &para; 1.i. to read "February 16" vice "November 9" and &para; 1.j. to 
read "for the Northern District of Texas on October 29" vice "fot eh (sic) Northern District of Texas on January 9."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 4; Tr. 19.  He has two years of college and served in the military for six 
years, from 1980-1986.  Tr. 19.  He obtained a secret security clearance in 1992 when he worked for the same defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 6.  He was laid off 
from that position in early 1995.</P> 
 
<P>In February 1989, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  Applicant's monthly expenses exceeded his income by over $200.  Ex. 4.  In July 1989, the 
court discharged more than $16,000 in debts.</P> 
 
<P>After he was laid off from his job with the defense contractor, Applicant formed his own long-haul trucking business, which he incorporated.  He had as many 
as 20 trucks hauling for him, the majority of which were owned by the drivers.  By the time he closed the business in early 2001, Applicant had been recalled to 
work for the defense contractor.  Tr. 22-23, 33-34.</P> 
 
<P>In June 2001, Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13.  They listed over $300,00 in unsecured debts and deficiencies.  Ex. 6 at 13.  In the 
bankruptcy petition, Applicant listed six judgments against him (Ex. 6 at 20) and denied that, in the previous six years, he had been an officer, director, or 
partner of any corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship (<EM>Id.</EM> at 24).  Applicant had known of his delinquent debts at least six months before the filing.  Tr. 
52.  On 20 February 2002, the court dismissed the bankruptcy without discharging Applicant's debts for failing to complete the paperwork required for filing.  
Ex. 5; Ex. 6 at 1-3.  Applicant had a lien placed on his home by his mortgage company.  Ex. H.  He had one of his vehicles repossessed.  Tr. 30.</P> 
 
<P>On 10 April 2001, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).  Question 35 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had any property 
repossessed for any reason.  Question 36 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other 
debts.  Question 37 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had any judgments that had not been paid.  Question 38 asked if, in the previous seven 
years, Applicant had been delinquent more than 180 days on any debts.  Question 39 asked if Applicant was then delinquent more than 90 days on any debts.  
Applicant answered "no" to each of these questions.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant' had not paid several debts totaling approximately $15,000 (&para;&para; 1.a.-h.) and that he had filed for bankruptcy protection in 
1989 and 2002 (&para;&para; 1.i.-1.j.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations in the SOR.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 
E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits each of the debts alleged in&para; 1.a.-1.g., but claims ignorance regarding the debt alleged in &para; 1.h.  That debt is for medical services from a doctor 
in 1996.  Ex. 3 at 7.  Applicant engaged a non-profit credit counseling service that contested every one of Applicant's debts, even those he admitted were 
genuine.  According to the credit counseling service, the doctor's debt and some of the other debts listed in the SOR were either deleted or upgraded to positive.  
Ex. B at 2.  This does not show the accounts were paid or resolved, merely that they may have been deleted from his credit report.  The latest correspondence 
from the credit counseling service is dated 24 November 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts may have resulted, in part, from the conditions beyond his control-failure of his business venture.  MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  He received some 
financial counseling concerning his debt problems, but there are not clear indications his problem is being resolved or under control.  <EM>See</EM> MC E2A6.1.3.4.  
Applicant admits his monthly income exceeds his expenses by between $1,000, yet he is not using that money to resolve his debts.  Tr. 48.  He claims he has 
paid some of his debts, but produced no documentation to corroborate his claims.  He owes his own company over $500, but still has not figured out what the 
debt is for.  Tr. 55.  He has not made a good-faith effort to pay his debts.  <EM>See </EM>MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  Under the circumstances, finding is against Applicant on &para;&para; 
1.a.-1.g. and 1.i.-1.j.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose relevant and material information concerning a lien (&para; 2.a.), unpaid 
judgments (&para; 2.b.), repossessions (&para; 2.c.), debts in the previous seven years delinquent more than 180 days (&para; 2.d.), and debts that were then delinquent more 
than 90 days (&para; 2.e.).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA his lien, his unpaid judgments, his repossessions, and 
delinquent debts. Proof Applicant omitted this information from his SCA shifted the burden to Applicant to explain the omissions sufficiently to negate a 
finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts he was unaware of his financial problems because he entrusted the finances to his wife, who he claims was an alcoholic and drug addict.  
Despite her condition, and their separation pending divorce, Applicant nevertheless avers he expected her to make payments on the Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
while he paid the mortgage on the couple's house.  It just would not be reasonable for him to trust his alcoholic, drug-addicted wife, who had gotten him into 
such financial difficulties in the first place, to pay on a substantial wage-earner plan.  He also claimed the debts were related to his business and he thought he 
was only required to list personal debts.  But he admits the debt alleged in &para; 1.f. was from his failure to pay his home mortgage.  And on his bankruptcy in 2001, 
he swore that, in the previous six years, he had not been an officer, director, partner, or managing executive in any corporation, partnership, or sole 
proprietorship.  Applicant was not a credible witness.  He admits being nervous when he filled out his SCA and did not seek assistance because he did not want 
others to know of his financial situation.  Tr. 53.  I find Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by omitting relevant and material facts from his SCA.  DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2.  None of the listed mitigating conditions apply to Applicant's case.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
