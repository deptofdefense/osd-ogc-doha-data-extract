<P>Applicant's possession of an Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, with intent to retain and use the passport to visit family in Iran demonstrated a 
foreign preference and was not mitigated where Applicant had not surrendered the passport or obtained formal approval for its use at the time of the hearing. 
Applicant was potentially subject to foreign influence where her father, stepmother, four siblings, and in-laws--with whom she maintained regular 
contact--were all citizens of Iran, residing in Iran. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>18 October 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-01605.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On </SPAN>11 
November 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was originally assigned to a different Administrative Judge, but was 
reassigned to me on 8 January 2003 and received by me the same day. On 15 January 2003, I set the case for hearing and issued a Notice of Hearing (NOH) on 
21 January 2003 for a hearing on 6 February 2003. On 30 January 2003, I amended the NOH to change the time of hearing when an earlier hearing was 
cancelled.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN>At the hearing, the government submitted 2 exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses. The Applicant submitted one exhibit--also admitted 
without objection--and the testimony of three witnesses, including herself. DOHA received the transcript on 14 February </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied being a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, but admitted possessing an Iranian passport after her naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 1999. She also 
admitted that close family members still reside in Iran as Iranian citizens; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 40-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Teheran in 1962--making her a citizen of Iran, governed then by the Shah of Iran.<A HREF="02-01605.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She was educated in Iran. She emigrated to the U.S. 
in 1987 to be with her husband, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1974 to attend college, but had become a legal permanent resident. He returned to Iran in 
1983 to marry Applicant. They resided together in Iran until 1985, when he returned to the U.S. It took him 18 months to obtain a Green Card for Applicant. 
She has resided in the U.S. since 1987 and has no intention of leaving the U.S. except for vacations and to visit family. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 
October 1999 (G.E. 1). Her husband became a U.S. citizen in 1990. Applicant has two daughters, both considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens. One was born 
in the U.S.; one was born in Iran. Both have Iranian passports.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 15 March 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF-86)(G.E. 1), on which she truthfully disclosed her dual citizenship, foreign 
relatives, and possession of a foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 27 November 2001, Applicant described her dual citizenship and foreign travel to the Defense Security Service (DSS)(G.E. 2):</SPAN></P> 
<P>My mother is deceased and my father still resides in Iran. My father, stepmother, and four siblings are all citizen of Iran and still reside in Iran. My in-laws also 
reside in Iran and  are Iranian citizens. I talk by telephone with my father and stepmother once a week to once every otter week. I talk with my siblings one to 
two times a year. I do not have any property or financial interest in Iran. I expect to inherit something from my father when he passes away but I am not sure 
what that inheritance might consist of. <STRONG>My only interest in Iran is my family that lives there. </STRONG>I receive nothing from the Iran government and do not receive 
any benefits from being a citizen of Iran nor do I stand to receive any benefits in the future. When I became a US citizen in 1999 I considered myself no longer a 
citizen of Iran. However. <STRONG>if I want to travel to Iran I have to have an Iranian Passport. Iran will not let me enter their country with my US passport. 
And the only reason I want to travel to Iran is to see my family. </STRONG>If my family were in the US I would have no desire or reason to travel to Iran. Since living 
in the US (1987) I have visited Iran on 3 separate occasions, in 1990, 1995, and in the spring of 1999. <STRONG>I renewed my Iran passport in 1999 just prior to going 
to Iran. I do not have another passport, other than the US passport. I would be  willing to renounce my Iranian citizenship and be willing to 
relinquish my Iranian passport if necessary to get a security clearance. This is not something I want to do because I want to be able to visit my family 
in Iran. And until policy changes I  need an Iran passport to travel to Iran. I have not taken any action to renounce my Iranian citizenship or 
relinquish my Iranian passport. </STRONG>(Emphasis added.)<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have never served in the Iranian military or even worked for the Iranian government. I have never performed any type of service in lieu of a military service 
obligation. Other than being able to have an Iranian Passport, I have no rights, privileges, benefits, or obligation to the Iran government. I have not accepted or 
exercised any privileges, rights, or benefits as a citizen of Iran. I have not taken any action to fulfill Iranian Citizenship requirements, nor do I maintain dual 
citizenship to protect financial interest in Iran. I have never registered for military service or with a foreign office, embassy or consulate to obtain benefits. I 
have never voted in a foreign election and have never held office in a foreign country. My allegiance and loyalty lie with the US and the fact that I have family 
in Iran could not be used to pressure me to act against the best interest of the US.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant possesses an Iranian passport issued in February 1999 (when Applicant was still a citizen only of Iran). This passport does not expire until January 
2004. Applicant used her Iranian passport to travel to Iran in June 1999 (again before her naturalization as a U.S. citizen). However, she retains the passport to 
facilitate future travel to Iran.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant testified consistently with her sworn statement that she retains her Iranian passport because she wants to be able to travel to Iran to 
visit family. She is aware of the State Department warnings about the problems encountered by Iranian-American dual citizens who attempt to travel to Iran on 
U.S. passports. </SPAN>She would travel to Iran on a U.S. passport if it was realistically possible to do so. Although she has previously expressed a willingness to 
renounce her Iranian citizenship, she is not especially desirous of doing so, and has taken no action to begin the renunciation process. Her father is retired and 
none of her relatives in Iran are employed by the government or involved in companies doing business with the government. However, Iran is a country whose 
intelligence operations are known to target U.S. interests.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor considers her a good employee, professional, responsible, and dependable. Applicant has handled company proprietary information 
appropriately (Tr. 35-39). A co-worker shares the supervisor's favorable impression of Applicant (Tr. 42-46). Both witnesses were aware of the security issues 
presented by Applicant's dual citizenship.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern:<EM> </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of  affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum(the "Money 
emo") to clarify the application of Guideline C., Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the 
ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum <STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</STRONG>(Emphasis added).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or 
trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States 
Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A dual citizen of Iran and the United States since her naturalization in 1999, Applicant's Iranian citizenship possesses little security significance if based solely 
on her birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Criterion C, Foreign Preference, she must have acted in a way to 
indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not 
required before the Government can seek to deny access under criterion C. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this 
Nations's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign countries of which one is also a citizen in cases of dual citizenship. I conclude the 
Government has established its case under Criterion C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claims to prefer her U.S. citizenship to her foreign citizenship, her conduct belies that assertion. Applicant testified she considered that she 
renounced her foreign citizenship when she took the oath of citizenship for the U.S. Certainly, her oath of allegiance to the U.S. and her rejection of allegiance 
to any foreign government in the citizenship oath is powerful evidence of a preference for U.S. citizenship. However, the citizenship oath does not 
automatically operate to terminate her citizenship rights in the country of her birth. Indeed, under Iranian law, Applicant's U.S. citizenship is null and void 
because she did not comply with the renunciation requirements of Iran. Nevertheless, the fact that she did not comply with the citizenship renunciation 
requirements of her native country--and thus is not considered by that country to have renounced that citizenship, or to have acquired U.S. citizenship--would 
ordinarily not affect the analysis of Applicant's preference. However, in this case Applicant reasserted her foreign citizenship and her preference for that 
citizenship when she applied for, received, and used her Iranian passport to travel there in June 1999. While she had not yet been naturalized as a U.S. citizen, 
she had applied for citizenship and was naturalized in October 1999. More important, although she has not used her Iranian passport to travel (to Iran or 
anywhere else) since becoming a U.S. citizen, she retains her Iranian passport because she wants to visit family in Iran and she knows that she can only travel to 
Iran on an Iranian passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A citizen of any country, including the U.S., who travels to another country, submits to the sovereignty of that country, including application of the foreign 
state's laws regarding visits by foreign citizens. However, a citizen of the U.S. who travels abroad as a U.S. citizen only, travels with the knowledge that the 
U.S. government is available to provide diplomatic assistance if the traveler encounters difficulty while traveling abroad. A dual citizen of the U.S. and a 
foreign state who travels to that foreign state faces potential difficulty in obtaining U.S. diplomatic assistance because the foreign state may insist on treating the 
traveler as a citizen of the foreign state. The traveler faces still greater complications where the foreign state considers the traveler to be a citizen of only the 
foreign state. In this case, Applicant applied for a passport from Iran knowing that she could not travel to that country except as a citizen of that country. She 
knows that Iran does not recognize her U.S. citizenship and will not permit her to travel to Iran as a U.S. citizen. She voluntarily chose to apply for, and accept, 
the benefits of her foreign citizenship in preference to her pending U.S. citizenship. The fact the foreign passport was required for her to visit Iran--under 
Iranian law--does not obscure the fact the choice to travel to Iran was hers to make. The fact that choosing to not travel to Iran is a difficult choice to make 
does not make the choice to travel there as a citizen of that country any less voluntary. Nor is her decision to retain the Iranian passport any less voluntary.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference. Her dual citizenship is not based merely on her birth in a foreign country, but on 
her active assertion of her citizenship rights in that country. Although her conduct is lawful, there is no evidence that the conduct was formally sanctioned by 
the United States. Applicant has expressed a conditional willingness to renounces her foreign citizenship which can be given little weight under the 
circumstances of this case, where she has indicated a clear reluctance to do so. She remains unwilling to renounce her foreign citizenship because she wishes to 
retain the ability to travel to Iran.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum only complicates matters for Applicant. The Memorandum states that Applicant's past possession and use of her Iranian passport 
can be mitigated only if she surrenders the passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. She had not undertaken to surrender the passport, and 
formal approval for use of the passport for what amount to tourist reasons is not available to her. Further, her inaction on her offer to renounce her citizenship 
and her unwillingness to surrender her Iranian passport cast serious doubt on her fitness for access to classified information, and presents an unacceptable level 
of risk that she has a foreign preference. I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, Applicant appears vulnerable to foreign influence. Applicant's father and other close relatives remain in Iran. She has frequent contact with 
them. Indeed, Applicant's intent to retain and exercise her Iranian citizenship--by keeping her Iranian passport--is rooted in her desire to be able to return to 
Iran and visit these relatives. Notwithstanding Applicant's representations that none of her family work for the Iranian government, the record contains 
insufficient information about her family members to conclude that they do not constitute an unacceptable security risk as required by MC 1, especially with 
regard to a country known to target U.S. interests. I resolve criterion B. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

1978, religious and political opposition to the Shah (and his hated internal security and intelligence service) increased the level of domestic turmoil in Iran. In 
January 1979, the Shah fled, and in February 1979 revolution swept the country. The December 1979 constitution created a theocratic republic guided by 
Islamic principles. In November 1979, revolutionary "students" invaded the U.S. Embassy and took personnel there hostage, not releasing them until 1981. The
