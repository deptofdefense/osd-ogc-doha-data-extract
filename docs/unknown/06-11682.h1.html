<P>Applicant, an officer in the United States Marine Corps, received a General Court-Martial in August 2002, and was sentenced to confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and dismissal 
from the Marine Corps.  On appeal, the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the sentence.  Applicant remains on appellate leave pending appeal to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Armed Services.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under the Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct guidelines of the Directive.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 26, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of 
Defense Directive,<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  On July 6, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR in writing  and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On July 25, 2006, the case was assigned to me. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant requested an expedited hearing and waived the 15-day rule specified at E3.1.8 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive.  On August 23, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses and offered three  exhibits for admission to the record  (Ex. 1 
through 3).  The Government's exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant called one witness and offered 32 exhibits for admission to the record.  Applicant's exhibits (Ex.) were identified as Ex. A through Z and Ex. A-1, B-1, C-1, D-1, E-1, and F-1.  
Applicant's exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open so that Applicant could submit, if he wished, evidence of his voluntary 
and involuntary appellate leave status.  Applicant submitted two memoranda addressed to him by his superiors addressing those issues.  The additional exhibits, marked as Applicant's Ex. G-1 and 
H-1, were admitted to the record without objection.  On August 30, 2006, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant 
admitted all allegations in the SOR.  ( Tr. 7-10.)  Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42 years old and, since April 2003, he has been employed as a program analyst by a government contractor.  (Ex. 1.)  He has been married for approximately 21 years.  He and his wife 
are the parents of two adult children.  (Answer to SOR at 2; Tr. 21.)  He has held a security clearance since approximately 1994. (Ex. 2.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1985, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served for approximately eleven years, attaining the rank of sergeant.  In 1993, Applicant was awarded a bachelor of 
science degree in aviation management.  In 1997, he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School, and upon completion, attained the rank of second lieutenant.  Applicant's command praised his 
work ethic, reliability, and strong sense of duty.  He quickly rose to first lieutenant and was selected to the rank of captain in 2000.  (Answer to SOR at 2; Ex. D, E, F, G.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In about June or July 2001 Applicant was charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with (1) Fraternization; (2) Conduct Unbecoming of an Officer; (3) Sodomy; and (4) 
Adultery.  He entered into a conditional pre-trial plea agreement and received a General Court-Martial on the charges in August 2002.  He was sentenced to 165 days confinement, forfeiture of all 
pay and allowances, and dismissal from the United States Marine Corps.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 28; 51.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was confined and served 139 of the 165 days of his sentence.  (Ex. 1; Answer to SOR at 1.)  He appealed his conviction to the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, 
asserting three assignments of error.  The appellate court found merit in one of Applicant's assignments of error and took corrective action.  The appellate court then set aside findings of guilty to 
three of the named charges, but affirmed charges and specifications reflecting two separate instances of conduct unbecoming an officer, specifically a quid pro quo offer by Applicant of time off 
from work in return for sex from a subordinate female Marine.  Additionally, the appellate court affirmed the sentence approved by the convening authority.  (Ex. A.)  Applicant subsequently 
appealed the military appellate court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.  At his hearing, citing advice from his attorney, he declined to discuss the conduct that resulted in 
his General Court-Martial.  (Tr. 22.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserted he had not been dismissed from the Marine Corps, and he produced memoranda addressed to him defining his military status under voluntary and involuntary appellate leave.  
(Tr. 79-80; Ex. G-1; H-1.)  Applicant has been on appellate leave since March 2003.  He receives no military pay, but retains an active duty identification card and  health benefits.  (Tr. 80-81.)  By 
memorandum dated September 7, 2004, Applicant's commanding officer notified him of his assignment to involuntary appellate leave and stated: "You remain subject to the UCMJ and orders of 
competent authority until discharged or dismissed, as appropriate."  (Ex. H-1 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant argued that the military offenses he was charged with under the UCMJ were insufficient to be identified as criminal conduct.  He acknowledged the conduct reflected poor judgment, but 
asserted the conduct did not reflect his whole character. (Tr. 72.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  
The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the guidelines in the Directive, official DoD policy guidance must also be considered.  Of particular relevance to this case is 10 U.S. C. &sect; 986, also known as the Smith Amendment.  
Section 986(c)(4) of the statute provides that an individual who has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions is prohibited from holding a security 
clearance.  The statute provides for a waiver of the prohibition in meritorious circumstances. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions 
listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J -  Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant received a General Court-Martial on about August 2, 2002 on charges of (1) Fraternization; (2) Conduct Unbecoming an Officer; (3) Sodomy; and (4) 
Adultery; that he entered into a conditional pre-trial guilty plea agreement; that he was sentenced to 165 days confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and dismissal from the United States 
arine Corps (1.a.).  The SOR also alleged in subparagraph 1.b. that Applicant's sentence of dismissal from the Marine Corps disqualified him from being granted a security clearance or from 
having a security clearance renewed, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted both Guideline J allegations, and he provided evidence that three of the charges against him had been set aside by the appellate court and two charges of conduct unbecoming an 
officer had been affirmed.  While Applicant argued the charges did not rise to the level of criminal conduct, the appellate court found the sentence imposed on him to be appropriate. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted criminal conduct raises security concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. and E2.A10.1.2.2.<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> of Guideline J and raises doubts about his judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness.  Directive E2.A10.1.1.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nevertheless security worthy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal conduct included two separate instances of conduct unbecoming an officer and was described by the appellate court as a quid pro quo offer by Applicant of time off from work 
for sex from a subordinate female Marine.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to an examination of mitigating conditions that might be applicable to Applicant's disqualifying conduct under Guideline J.  Applicant's criminal conduct occurred in 2001, and thus is not 
recent, making Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A10.1.3.1.<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> applicable to his case.  However, Applicant's criminal actions were multiple and not isolated events and demonstrated a pattern of 
criminal conduct.  At his hearing, Applicant minimized the seriousness of his conduct and opined it should not be considered criminal, leading to the conclusion that at this time there is no clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Thus, neither MC E2.A10.1.3.2. nor MC E2.A10.1.3.6.<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> of Guideline J applies to Applicant's Guideline J conduct.  No other mitigating conditions under 
Guideline J are applicable to the facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, allegation 1.a. of the SOR is concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As a Marine Corps officer, Applicant received a sentence of dismissal from military service.  The dismissal of an officer from military service is equivalent to a dishonorable discharge of an enlisted 
person.  Thus, an officer dismissed from military service would be disqualified from being granted a security clearance, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(4).  (<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-11112 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 8, 2006.) </P> 
 
<P>At the time of his hearing, Applicant's appeal of his sentence of dismissal was before a military appellate court, and he was on involuntary appellate leave.  Because Applicant's sentence of 
dismissal has not been executed while his case is on appeal, it is premature to consider whether the prohibition of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986)(c)(4) applies to his case.  Accordingly, the allegation at 1.b. of the 
SOR is concluded for Applicant.    </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's General Court-Martial on the charges recited in allegation 1.a. raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, about Applicant's judgment, reliability, 
and ability to comply with rules and regulations. (&para; 2.a.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Additionally, Applicant's refusal at his security clearance hearing to provide full, frank, and truthful answers 
to lawful questions surrounding the charges brought at his Court-Martial raises concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.1.2.<A HREF="06-11682.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  The criminal conduct which led to Applicant's General Court-Martial was reliable, 
unfavorable information provided by Applicant's employer, the United States Marine Corps, thus raising a security concern about Applicant's unreliability and poor judgment under D.C. 
E2.A5.1.2.1.  Applicant's conduct unbecoming an officer raised concerns that this information, if known, increased his vulnerability to coercion and blackmail.  DC E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises 
additional concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation, including his violation of his commitment, as a Marine Corps officer, to adhere to the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Applicant's conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.1. does not apply to the facts of this case: the information supplied by Applicant's Marine Corps leadership regarding his Court-Martial is pertinent to a 
determination of his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  Additionally, MC E2.A5.1.3.5. does not apply, since Applicant tended to minimize the seriousness of his conduct and failed to 
provide persuasive evidence that since his General Court Martial he has taken positive steps to eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  At his hearing, Applicant asserted his 
attorney advised him to refuse to provide information on the facts that led to his Court-Martial, but he provided no credible evidence he was not required to comply with security processing 
requirements.  Thus, MC E2.A5.1.3.6. does not apply.  None of the other Guideline E mitigating conditions are applicable to Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the Guideline E allegation in the SOR 
is concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past 
transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  
Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I 
conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in 
Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended. </SPAN></P>
