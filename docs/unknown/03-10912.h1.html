<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 56-year-old security officer. Applicant engaged in three extra-marital affairs with church members while he was a pastor of a congregation. The

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 22, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,<EM> Defense</EM> <EM>Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive)<EM>,</EM> dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant because of security concerns arising under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his sworn answer dated January 13, 2004, Applicant responded to each of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have the case decided on 
the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in writing on June 7, 2005. Department Counsel provided a 
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the allegations. Applicant provided a written response to the FORM dated August 31, 2005.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The case was assigned to me on September 
6, 2005. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (paragraphs 1.a, 1.b and 1.c).<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant admitted the allegation 
under Guideline D (paragraph 2.a) but denied the behavior was a criminal offense or could lead to coercion. Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings 
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 56-year-old security officer for a defense contractor. He submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on August 9, 2002. Applicant had a 
prior top secret clearance in 1979.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant graduated from college in 1977 and attended divinity school receiving a Master's of Divinity after a few years. He served as pastor of several 
churches for 17 years.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married from August 15, 1970, until June 8, 1998. He has five children from that marriage.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He is now divorced.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In about 1978 or 1979, while serving as pastor of a church, Applicant had an extra-marital affair with a member of his congregation. He resigned from his 
position after being confronted with the affair.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant stated the affair was a matter of common knowledge among family, friends, and acquaintances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From June 1997 to 1998, Applicant engaged in two extra-marital affairs with two members of his congregation. The women were sisters.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The husband of the 
first woman lodged a complaint against Applicant. Applicant spoke to the Bishop and resigned from that post as pastor in 1997 after the allegation and 
complaint.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The affairs continued after his resignation. In 1997, Applicant received counseling for an adjustment disorder.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed an application for his security clearance (SF 86) in 2002. Question 19  read as follows:<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>YOUR MEDICAL RECORD</STRONG> [:]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care 
provider about a mental health related condition?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No" to the Question.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He did not respond affirmatively because he sought counseling on his own.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was interviewed initially for his security clearance, he did not disclose one affair. A DSS investigator interviewed Applicant in 2003 in 
connection with his application. <A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>At that time, he disclosed the extra-marital affairs. He explained he did not mention the incident because it was over and his 
wife was aware of the situation.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits his sexual behavior reflects a lack of judgment or discretion. However, he states he was never vulnerable to 
coercion because the affairs were common knowledge among his family, friends, colleagues and acquaintances. <A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his August 2005 Response to the FORM, Applicant admits making a mistake but affirms he is not a threat to the safety and security of the United States. He 
is rebuilding his life and wants to give back by being a security officer. However, Applicant expresses concern that his grandchildren will ask why he left the 
ministry and is afraid someone other than himself will tell them the reason.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

evaluated when determining security clearance eligibility. The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that are considered in 
denying or revoking an employee's request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and those factors that are considered in granting an 
employee's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual circumstances of each case are always 
different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, to arrive at meritorious decisions. Section E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a 
case as the "whole person concept." In evaluating the conduct of the applicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should 
consider pursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, 
decisions under the Directive must</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">include consideration of not just the <EM>actual </EM>risk of disclosure of such information, but also consideration of any <EM>possible</EM> risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently compromise classified information in any aspect of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified 
information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily a 
determination of the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense 
for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> When the government meets this burden, the 
corresponding heavy burden of rebuttal then falls on the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the position of the government, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's 
clearance.<A HREF="03-10912.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and guidelines, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline E. Applicant's actions reveal a pattern of conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and 
unreliability. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While serving as a pastor, Applicant engaged in two separate extra-marital affairs with three different women in his congregations. Applicant was forced to 
resign from two different churches for this behavior. Therefore Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>reliable,</EM> <EM>unfavorable 
information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's personal conduct also falls within PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4. (<EM>personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation</EM>,<EM> or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community 
standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2.( <EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form</EM>). Despite Applicant's assertion that the affairs were 
matters of common knowledge, Applicant did not provide any support for his assertions. Also Applicant was not forthright with the DSS investigator about the 
affairs and did not admit the affairs until confronted with the information. He is now concerned about his grandchildren learning of the incidents. I find that his 
personal conduct could increase his vulnerability to coercion or render him susceptible to blackmail.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In response to Question 19, Applicant denied past mental health counseling. I do not find his explanation that he relied on someone in the class who said that 
the question only referred to a domestic violence or criminal incident as reasonable. Applicant's other reason is also not plausible. He stated that since he went 
to counseling on his own accord, the question did not apply. Applicant did not answer the question because of his concern it might lead to a query about this 
extra-marital affairs. I conclude Applicant intentionally falsified his response to Question 19. None of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. I conclude 
that Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1. c. of the SOR are concluded against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline D. Applicant admitted he engaged in extramarital affairs with three women in his congregation over a 
period of   years while serving as pastor of a church. Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) E.2.A.4.1.2.4. (<EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature 
and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM>) applies in this case. SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3. (<EM>sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or duress),</EM> also<EM> </EM>applies.<EM> </EM>My reasoning is the same as discussed above under personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no information of other instances of this behavior reported or charges. Since the affairs took place seven years ago, Sexual Behavior Mitigating 
Condition (SB MC) E2.A4.1.3.2. <EM>(the behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM> ) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the remaining SB MC and conclude they do not apply. SB MC E2.A4.1.3.3. (<EM>there is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, 
or emotional instability) </EM>does<EM> </EM>not apply<EM>. </EM> Applicant's rationalization raises serious questions regarding his judgment, responsibility, and truthfulness. Applicant 
has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. The evidence leaves questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability. Accordingly, 
allegation 2.a.  of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was a mature, married man with five children serving in a position of trust as a pastor and a counselor in two different churches. His first extra-marital affair in 1979 and resignation from the Ministry did not stop him from having affairs in 1997 with two women who were sisters and member of his 
congregation. He continues to minimize the situation stating the affairs were common knowledge. This unproven assertion does not diminish questions about 
Applicant's trustworthiness and judgment. Applicant also did not answer Question 19 on the 2002 security application</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">truthfully. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I 
conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
