<P>Applicant's 1974 conviction for receiving stolen property and subsequent sentence to three years imprisonment requires revocation of his clearance under 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986 notwithstanding that Applicant spent no time in prison and had his clearance granted without a hearing in 1989. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 20 August 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 3 
September 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and originally requested an determination on the record. However, on 25 October 2002, he requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on 9 January 2003. I set the case on 19 February 2003, and issued a Notice of Hearing on 24 February 2003 for a hearing on 12 
arch 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented four exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses;  Applicant presented 10 exhibits and the testimony of 
six witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 20 March 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>At the hearing, I queried Department Counsel and Applicant's Counsel on their positions regarding the effect, if any, of Applicant's restoration of civil rights on 
the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to this case, and gave Applicant's Counsel until 21 March 2003 to brief his position if he chose to do so, giving Department 
Counsel an opportunity to respond and to brief separately if she chose to do so (Tr. 78-86). On 21 March 2003, Applicant's Counsel argued the inapplicability 
of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 based on its retroactive application to Applicant and his restoration to civil rights in 1976. Department Counsel responded with a citation to 
an Appeal Board ruling holding that a state pardon or parole did not negate the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986. She also pointed out the plain language of 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986 that requires that no clearance be renewed if an Applicant has been sentenced to more than one year in prison. The statute makes no mention of 
actual time served and creates no exception for conduct previously adjudicated by granting a clearance.</P> 
<P>I conclude the plain language of the statue applies to the circumstances of Applicant's case and is not affected by the restoration of his civil rights in 1976.</P>

<P>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he has held since 1989.</SPAN></P> 
<P>On 20 August 1971, Applicant was arrested and charged with buying, receiving, and concealing stolen property (G.E. 3).<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He was  acquitted of one charge in 
April 1973 (A.E. J)<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, found guilty on one charge contrary to his pleas in January 1974 (A.E. A) , and found guilty after pleading guilty on another charge on the 
same day in January 1974 (in the wake of the jury finding)(A.E. B). He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, but served no time in jail. He was placed on 
probation for two years, which he completed without incident. In June 1976, the state parole board restored his civil rights (G.E. 2).<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant applied for, and obtained, his security clearance in 1989 (G.E. 1). Applicant detailed the circumstances of the offense in a sworn statement to the DSS 
on 23 June 1989 (G.E. 4). Applicant received his clearance in 1989 as a routine administrative matter without having to go through a due process proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In December 2000, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) for his periodic reinvestigation on which he truthfully 
disclosed his felony conviction above.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a professional truck driver "leased" along with his truck to a shipping company whose largest shipper is the U.S. Government. The Government 
Operations Division specializes in transporting classified shipments, including munitions and highly-sensitive communications equipment. The company owns 
no shipping equipment; the government division "leases" approximately 300 drivers and their trucks, such as Applicant. Applicant's rig is highly specialized, 
suitable only for the kind of classified hauling Applicant does (A.E. I; Tr. 60-62, 64-68). He has completed specialized training for hauling hazardous cargo (A. 
E. H). He has been an exemplary employee of the company for over 20 years (A.E. D) and has been recognized as such by being asked to join a company-sponsored organization that only a select few of the truckers are asked to join (Tr. 51-52; A.E. E, F, G). Applicant was recognized in April 2001 by a defense 
agency for his excellent work in transporting communications equipment needed for Presidential communications to the Texas White House (Tr. 57-58).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant produced an impressive array of witnesses in support of his request for a waiver. The probation officer<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> who did his pre-sentence investigation, 
supervised his probation, and recommended restoration of his civil rights found Applicant to be a well-respected member of the community who presented no 
problems while on probation (Tr. 22-28). A retired local judge<A HREF="02-06296.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> who employed Applicant's spouse as a legal secretary for a number of years knows Applicant 
as a very trustworthy and dependable person and has no reservations about him having a clearance (Tr. 33-37). Applicant's banker since 1985 trusts him enough 
to make "interesting" financial accommodations to Applicant when he is on the road and knows him to be "honest and upright," a man who's word can be 
trusted (Tr. 42-44). The company Director of Government Operations and Facility Security Officer traveled from company headquarters in another state to 
praise Applicant as one of the star performers in a division of highly-trained star performers who transport critical cargo (Tr. 46-56). Applicant's spouse, who 
has driven with him since about 1985 knows him as a good and honest man, sometimes to the point of being annoying (Tr. 63-69). The DIS agent who 
conducted Applicant's 1989 background investigation, and is now retired himself, recommended Applicant for a security clearance (A.E. C).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance,

Smith Amendment], precluding the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DoD) under four specific circumstances. 
On 7 June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing regulations under DoD 5200.2-R; the Director, DOHA issued Operating Instruction 64 
(O.I. 64) on 10 July 2001.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's 
fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the 
disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J, which cannot be mitigated under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986. The statute requires that I not renew Applicant's 
clearance because he was sentenced to three years imprisonment, notwithstanding that he served no prison time, completed his probation without incident, and 
had his civil rights restored shortly after completing his probation. Applicant's conduct was mitigated and he was granted a clearance in 1989 without a due 
process proceeding under guidelines essentially the same as the current directive. That prior adjudication does not bind me in this case. However, the only fact 
that has changed since the 1989 adjudication is the passage of another nearly 14 years without any criminal conduct. Department Counsel concedes that but for 
10 U.S.C. &sect;986 Applicant would probably receive his clearance (Tr. 78). Accordingly, I would grant Applicant's clearance were I free to do so under the 
existing disqualifying and mitigating factors.</P> 
<P>Unfortunately for Applicant, the law has changed since his 1989 adjudication and requires me to revoke his clearance. However, because I do so solely because 
of the requirements of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, I make the following statement as required under O.I. 64: <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 
10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</SPAN></P>
