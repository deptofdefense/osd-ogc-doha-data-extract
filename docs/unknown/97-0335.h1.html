<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On May 20, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense Industrial</EM>
<EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 9<A HREF="97-0335.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, 1997,  and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on July
1, 1997, and on August 20, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether
it was clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's
security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of five exhibits and no witnesses; Applicant
relied on his own testimony and one exhibit.  Applicant supplemented the record with an additional
exhibit after the conclusion of the hearing.  The exhibit was accepted into evidence without objection
by Department Counsel.  A transcript of the proceeding was received on September 3, 1997</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has denied all of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR under Criterion F,
except for the factual allegation set forth under subparagraph 1.a., which he has admitted.  I have
accepted Applicant's admission and incorporate it as part of my findings of fact.  After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make
the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is 32 years old and has been employed by his current employer--a defense
contractor--since July 1996.  He had previously held a security clearance from 1987 to 1993 while
a member of the National Guard of State X.  A favorable preliminary determination could not be
made on Applicant's current suitability for a security clearance because of financial considerations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant began to fall behind in his financial obligations after relocating to a high-cost
metropolitan area in August 1992; he had previously lived in a more rural area where the cost of
living was much lower.  Because he did not adjust his lifestyle, he was unable to live within his
budget due to the higher living costs of his new home.  He has lived in expensive apartments and
until recently, he was eating all of his meals at restaurants--seven days a week.  To finance his
lifestyle, he had to borrow money.  He opened two accounts with Credit Union A in mid-1993; one
account was a $5,000.00 signature loan, the other was a credit card with a $5,000.00 line of credit
(both obligations are alleged in subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR).   He borrowed more than $5,000.00
from Creditor B (obligation alleged in subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR) in May 1993 to pay the tuition
which enabled him to complete the requirements for his degree in computer information systems.<A HREF="97-0335.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
In addition to these obligations, Applicant also borrowed more than $2,000.00 from members of his
family.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	 After Applicant received his degree from College X in June 1993, he was unable to find a
good-paying job in his career field.  He worked at a series of jobs (Gov. Exh 1), but none of them
paid a salary which enabled him to meet current living expenses as well as pay down the debts which
he had been incurring.  From July 1993 to December 1993, he earned an average of $2,000.00 per
month; from December 1993 to February 1994, he was unemployed. During this time, he had
borrowed the maximum amount on the two accounts from Credit Union A.  He continued to make
payments to the Credit Union until 1995 when the payments became too burdensome.  When he
attempted to reduce his monthly payments by consolidating the two obligations, the Credit Union
refused because each obligation had a different interest rate.  He had made several payments on his
loan to creditor B, but had fallen several months behind in these payments by July 1996.  During the
same time frame, he had checks returned ("bounced") for insufficient funds and his utilities were
disconnected on "some occasions" because of late payments (Gov. Exh 3).  By March of 1997, his
indebtedness to Credit Union A exceeded $13,000.00, and his indebtedness to Creditor B exceeded
$4,400.00.  Applicant was not making regular payments to either creditor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In July 1996, Applicant accepted a position with his current employer at a salary which was
substantially higher than the salaries he had previously received.  His annual salary at the time of
hire was $55,000.00.  As of the date of his hearing, it had increased to $60,500.00.  Applicant has
recently taken steps to address his overdue debts. He has met with Consumer Counseling Credit
Service(CCCS); they have established a repayment schedule for him with the two creditors whose
obligations are alleged in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.   By the time the record had closed in his case,
Applicant was able to provide  evidence that he had made payments totaling more than $1,100.00
on these obligations. He has also provided evidence that he had made payments totaling
$1,720.00--during 1995--on the loans that had been made to him by members of his family.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	He explained at the hearing that he had repaid the members of his family before repaying
other creditors, because he felt his relatives were "the people that were going to help (him) out if (he)
was in a bad situation" (Tr. 47-48).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	With respect to the allegation set forth in subparagraph 1.b., Applicant has provided
persuasive evidence through his testimony and through documents, that he has paid the $924.00
which he supposedly owes for back rent.  It is unlikely that the company--to whom this
indebtedness is allegedly owed--would have rented apartments to Applicant on <STRONG>two</STRONG> subsequent
occasions if he had failed or refused to settle an account from a previous occupancy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant testified that he had recently been offered a position with a company where he
would not have needed a security clearance.  He decided to stay with his current employer because
he "fully committed" to the repayment schedule which CCCS has worked out for him (Tr. 54-57).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving
any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate that the facts proven have a
nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></STRONG></U>(Criterion F)</CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>(1)	A history of not meeting financial obligations;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(4)	The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or
is under control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(6)	The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criterion F.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each
of the factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's admissions and explanations establish a well-documented case of financial
irresponsibility.  For a substantial period of time, Applicant mismanaged his money and lived
beyond his means.  Each year, one or two checks were returned for insufficient funds; his utilities
were disconnected because he did not make his payments on time.  Meanwhile, his profligate life
style included spending more than $700.00 each month eating all of his meals at restaurants.  Except
for the loan from Creditor B--which he used to finance his education--Applicant incurred the
remainder of his indebtedness living a lifestyle which far exceeded his income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Mitigation for Applicant's indebtedness is found in his recent effort to pay down his
obligations and live a more responsible life style.  Mitigation is also found in the fact that his
indebtedness is not that excessive for someone with his income.  He has provided persuasive
evidence that he has satisfied the obligation alleged in subparagraph 1.b. in 1994, and that he had
substantially paid off the loans made to him by family members--which were not alleged in the
SOR.  His total, remaining indebtedness is less than $20,000.00--not a substantial amount for
someone with a current annual income in excess of $60,000.00, and with the potential for significant
future increases.  He has received counseling from CCCS and has made payments in excess of
$1100.00 since answering the SOR.  He also provided credible testimony that he understands the
consequences of not following through on his commitment to satisfy his delinquent financial
obligations in accordance with the agreement entered with the CCCS.  If Applicant were not serious
about this commitment, he would have taken the easy way out.  He would have accepted one of the
positions recently offered to him which did not require a security clearance. Criterion F is concluded
for Applicant.	</FONT></P>
