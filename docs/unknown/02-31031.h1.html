<P>Applicant drank to excess from approximately 1975 until May 2002 and was discharged from the U.S. Air Force as an alcohol abuse rehabilitation failure.  He 
also was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and arrested for an alcohol-related domestic disturbance.  He continues to consume alcohol 
and has offered no explanation or mitigating evidence.  He incorrectly listed his arrest for the domestic disturbance under the wrong question on his security 
clearance application (SF 86).  Security concerns based on falsification of the SF 86 are mitigated, but the concerns based on alcohol consumption are not 
mitigated.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 14, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 9, 2004, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant admitted 
the allegations under Guideline G in the SOR &para; 1.a. (excessive alcohol consumption from 1975 to May 2002), 1.d. (a general discharge from the Air Force as an 
alcohol abuse rehabilitation failure), 1.e. (conviction of operating a vehicle while intoxicated), 1.f. (alcohol-related domestic violence), and 1.g. (continued use 
of alcohol after diagnosis of alcohol abuse).  He denied the allegations in &para; 1.b. that he was treated for probable alcohol abuse with impaired functioning and 
pathologic use, entered an alcohol rehabilitation program, interfered with a civilian police operation while intoxicated, and failed to satisfactorily complete the 
alcohol rehabilitation program.  He denied the allegation in &para; 1.c. that he was arrested for public intoxication.  Finally, he denied the allegation under Guideline 
E in the SOR &para; 2.a. that he falsified his security clearance application.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on November 30, 2004.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided 
to Applicant on December 3, 2004, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on December 10, 2004, but he did not respond.  The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44-year-old HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) technician, employed by a defense contractor.  He was worked for his present 
employer since March 2002.  He has never held a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant first consumed alcohol on one occasion when he was 14 years old.  He did not drink again until his last two years of high school, when he began 
consuming up to 12 beers at monthly parties.  After he graduated from high school, he regularly consumed three or four beers at weekend parties and 
occasionally drank up to six beers, which caused him to become drunk, with staggered walk and slurred speech.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from June 1985 until March 1987.  While in the Air Force, he was treated in September 1986 at a military medical 
facility for alcohol abuse, identified as a problem drinker, and placed in an alcohol rehabilitation program.  Although the FORM contains correspondence 
regarding Applicant's placement in the rehabilitation program, it does not reflect the specific diagnosis of "probable alcohol abuse with impaired functioning 
and pathologic use" alleged in the SOR, nor does it reflect the identity or medical credentials of the person who made the diagnosis.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1987, Applicant interfered with civilian police officers attempting to make a drug arrest, and he was charged with public intoxication.  In the same 
month, he was removed from the rehabilitation program for unwillingness to cooperate, and in March 1987 he received a general discharge from the Air Force 
as an alcohol abuse rehabilitation failure.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1991, Applicant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.  He was sentenced to a $500.00 fine and 10 days in jail, and his 
driver's license was suspended for one year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence and harassment.  He had consumed 12 or more beers before being arrested.  He 
pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a fine.  The sentence was deferred for 24 months, conditioned on attending an alcohol 
education program and a 36-week domestic violence program.  Applicant admitted continuing to consume alcohol after being identified as a problem drinker. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant executed a SF 86 March on 15, 2002.  He answered "no" to question 26, asking whether in the last seven years he had been arrested for, charged 
with, or convicted of any offenses not listed under questions 21 (felonies), 22 (firearms/explosives offenses), 23 (pending charges), 24 (alcohol/drug offenses), 
or 25 (courts-martial or disciplinary actions).  He did not disclose his arrest for domestic violence and harassment under question 26, but he did disclose it under 
question 30, asking about alcohol-related treatment or counseling.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 1)  may arise from alcohol-related 
incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although Applicant denied being arrested for public intoxication 
(SOR &para; 1.c.), it is established by the military police report (FORM Item #6).  Applicant's arrest for public intoxication and his admission of the allegations in 
SOR &para;&para; 1.e. (driving while intoxicated) and 1.f. (alcohol-related domestic violence) establish DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition may arise from habitual or binge drinking to the point of impaired judgment (DC 5).  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.5.  Applicant's admission 
he consumed alcohol to excess, up to 12 beers per day on weekends (SOR &para;1.a.) establishes DC 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying conditions also may arise from a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a credentialed medical professional (DC 3) or licensed 
clinical social worker in a recognized alcohol treatment program (DC 4), or consumption of alcohol subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed 
medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program (DC 6).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A7.1.2.3.; E2.A7.1.2.4.; E2.A7.1.2.6.  Applicant 
admitted he continued to use alcohol notwithstanding treatment for probable alcohol abuse (SOR &para; 1.g.), but he did not admit being diagnosed by a credentialed 
medical professional or licensed clinical social worker.  There are no documents in the FORM showing the identity or credentials of the person who diagnosed 
Applicant.  The documents regarding Applicant's discharge from the Air Force refer only to a "drinking problem."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations in SOR &para; 1.b.  However, his failure to complete the alcohol rehabilitation program is established by the Substance Abuse 
Control Program Rehabilitation Committee Review (FORM Item #7).  His interference with the drug arrest while intoxicated is established by the military 
police report (FORM Item #6).  Based on the evidence, I conclude the allegations in the SOR &para; 1.b. pertaining to his interference with police operations and his 
failure to complete the rehabilitation program are established, but the allegation pertaining to a diagnosis of "probable alcohol abuse" is not established.  
Because of the absence of evidence regarding the identity and credentials of the person who diagnosed Applicant, DC 3, DC 4, and DC 6 are not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has offered no explanations for his conduct.  The evidence establishes no mitigating conditions.  Accordingly, I conclude the security concern arising 
from his alcohol consumption is not mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  DC 2 applies where there has been a 
deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive &para;E2.A5.1.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied 
deliberately omitting relevant and material information.  He disclosed the domestic disturbance under question 30 instead of question 27.  Department Counsel 
concedes Applicant's disclosure under question 30 mitigated the conduct alleged in the SOR &para; 2.a.  I conclude DC 2 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant</SPAN></P>
