<P>Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline H (illegal drugs) security concerns stemming from his long history of marijuana 
use, at times while holding a security clearance, and his multiple deliberate false statements to the government about his drug use. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On September 21, 2004, DOHA issued 
to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline H (illegal drugs). </P> 
<P>Applicant timely answered the SOR (Answer), and admitted, with explanation, the allegation he had used marijuana from 1978 until 2000 (SOR &para; 1.a); he 
denied, with explanation, the allegation he had used marijuana while holding a security clearance (SOR &para; 1.b). Applicant also admitted, with explanation, the 
allegations he had deliberately falsified his answers to drug-related questions in three different security questionnaires (SOR &para;&para; 2.a, 2.c, and 2.d) and that he was 
denied a security clearance in March 2002 (SOR &para; 2.e). Applicant denied, with explanation, the allegation he deliberately falsified an answer to a drug-related 
question in an October 2001 questionnaire (SOR &para; 2.b). Applicant also requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on June 27, 2005, and I convened a hearing September 7, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and the government presented 
seven exhibits (GE 1 through 7), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and presented five exhibits (AE A through E), 
which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on September 21, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 50 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a senior communications and signals processing engineer. He holds a bachelor's degree and a 
master's degree in electrical engineering. He has received several academic and professional awards, is a member of academic and professional fraternities, and 
holds patents relating to voice communications technology in a variety of applications. He is well-regarded by his employer, several neighbors and friends, and 
is generally known as highly accomplished in his technical field of endeavor. Applicant and his wife have been married for 27 years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant illegally used marijuana with varying frequency between 1973, when he was in high school, and September 2001, when he was in his mid-40s. 
Between 1973 and 1978, he used the drug weekly, sometimes buying as much as 1/4 pound of marijuana for use with friends. For the next 12 years, Applicant's 
use was more recreational and sporadic, and sometimes with his wife. Applicant did not use marijuana from 1990 through 1994. In 1995, Applicant used 
marijuana about three times, then did not use marijuana again until he used marijuana about three times during the period June 1999 through September 2001. 
He decided to stop using marijuana at that time because he was concerned about drug testing as he tried to look for a new job. (GE 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1985, Applicant applied for a security clearance. He submitted a DoD Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ), question 15.a of which asked if 
Applicant had ever used drugs, including marijuana. Applicant answered "no" to that question because he was concerned if he answered truthfully, he would 
not get the job for which he needed that security clearance. (GE 6; Answer)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1994, Applicant submitted a DoD National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ), again for the purpose of getting or keeping a security clearance. He 
answered "no" to NAQ question 20.a, which asked if Applicant had used drugs, including marijuana. Applicant falsified his answer because he wanted to be 
consistent with his previous answer in 1985 and feared he would lose his job if he revealed he had used marijuana. (GE 5; Answer) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was granted a security clearance in July 1995. (GE 1; GE 3) The record is unclear about whether this was a new clearance or a continuance of any 
clearance he may have held as a result of his 1985 PSQ. Through much of the 1990s, Applicant performed engineering consulting for a variety of companies. 
This work was arranged through a contracting agency that matched Applicant's skills with those companies' needs. Some of the work required access to 
classified information, some did not.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2001, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SCA), this time to obtain a Top Secret/SCI clearance with the National Security 
Agency (NSA). In response to question 27, which asked if Applicant had used drugs, including marijuana, in the preceding seven years, Applicant answered 
"no." Applicant claimed he was concerned about his privacy when filling out the SCA in that he had to complete the form in a room through which other people 
were coming and going. Subsequently, Applicant disclosed his use of marijuana as well as other drugs in an interview with an NSA investigator in January 
2002. (GE 4; Answer) The interview was conducted in the pre-test phase of a polygraph examination of Applicant.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received a Top Secret / SCI clearance after he submitted his October 2001 SCA. However, after his interview in January 2002, Applicant's NSA 
access was revoked in March 2002 due to his drug use and his falsification of his SCA. Applicant was eligible to re-apply for his NSA clearance in December 
2003, and he submitted another SCA that month. (GE 1; GE 3) His request for access through NSA was still pending as of this hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline H (illegal 
drugs) and Guideline E (personal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears he deliberately omitted from three different security questionnaires facts about his use 
of marijuana. The government also alleged Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance, and that he ultimately lost a security clearance with 
another agency because of his drug use and false statements about his drug use. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has 
exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such 
conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has presented sufficient information, in the form of Applicant's admissions, his testimony, and information obtained during his background 
investigation to support the allegations in the SOR and the preliminary decision to deny his request for clearance. I conclude from the available information that 
Applicant deliberately and repeatedly tried to hide the fact of he had used illegal drugs with varying frequency for most of his adult life. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The facts established 
support application of Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 2<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 5.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, after reviewing the Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC), I conclude none apply. As to Applicant's false answers about his drug use in the 1985 and 
1994 questionnaires, Applicant deliberately lied to protect his own interests. Such conduct is in direct conflict with the fiduciary nature of one's responsibilities 
in protecting classified information. While he claims in his defense these falsifications are not recent, the record is not to be analyzed in such a piecemeal 
fashion and I have weighed his earlier falsifications together with his 2001 SCA, the pleadings in this case, and all of the available information. The facts 
presented here, when considered together, show an ongoing history of concealing from the government information he knows to be adverse to his own interests. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding his October 2001 SCA, Applicant claims he was concerned about his privacy when he completed the questionnaire. Here, again, Applicant placed 
his own interests ahead of the government's need to make a fully-informed decision about Applicant's suitability for access. Applicant further asserts he made 
"a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the error before being confronted with the facts." (Answer) However, the record shows Applicant did not disclose his 
marijuana use for nearly four months, disclosing this adverse information only when faced with a polygraph examination. This conduct does not meet the 
standard of prompt, good-faith disclosure before confrontation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant further denies he used marijuana while holding a security clearance, which would render his answer to question 28 in the October 2001 SCA truthful. 
Specifically, Applicant contends he did not "knowingly" use drugs while holding a clearance because he thought his clearance had to be cancelled because he 
was not working in a job that required a clearance. However, it is uncontroverted Applicant was granted a clearance in 1995 and he smoked marijuana at least 
three times that same year. He had applied for a clearance so his services could be contracted out. The contracting agency might at any time find Applicant work 
in a classified environment, and the fact he was not so assigned through the late 1990's did not appear to alter his cleared status.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Lastly, Applicant claims his loss of a security clearance in 2002 was based solely on his then recent drug use, not on any concerns about his honesty, and that he 
has demonstrated he is and will continue to be fully candid with the government. However, GE 3 plainly states his clearance was revoked because of his drug 
use and his deliberate falsification of his SCA. His history of false statements to the government and his unwillingness to tell the truth until confronted with a 
polygraph test, and his willingness to use illegal drugs in the first place underscore the government's concerns about his personal conduct. Accordingly, I 
conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also questions Applicant's suitability for access to classified information based on his illegal use of marijuana between 1973 and 2001, at times 
while holding a security clearance. Under Guideline H, improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or 
ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. Such conduct may also be criminal and indicative of a disregard for rules and regulations used to protect national 
interests.<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In this instance, the government has produced sufficient information through its exhibits and Applicant's admissions to support the preliminary 
decision as expressed in the SOR that Applicant should be denied a security clearance because of his drug use. Available information shows Applicant has used 
and purchased illegal drugs with varying frequency for much of his adult life. For the same reasons expressed under Guideline E, above, I conclude he also used 
marijuana while holding a security clearance. Guideline H disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to the government's information, Applicant asserts his drug use is no longer a security concern because Guideline H MC 1<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3<A HREF="03-04549.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. 
Indeed, it appears Applicant last used marijuana at least four years ago. However, he had used the drug off and on for nearly 30 years, abstaining only when it 
appeared he would be subjected to drug testing or other heightened scrutiny. As for any future intent not to use illegal drugs, his repeated falsifications about his 
drug use show the government cannot rely on Applicant's claim in this regard. Accordingly, any benefit Applicant might realize from his current abstinence is 
undermined by his poor credibility and by his extensive history of drug use. I conclude Guideline H against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. No single adjudicative factor 
or finding is dispositive of this decision. Rather, I have made a fair and commonsense assessment of the entire record before me as required by Directive 
Section E2.2.3. Reasonable doubts persist about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant has failed to provide, I 
cannot conclude he has overcome the government's case.</SPAN></P>
