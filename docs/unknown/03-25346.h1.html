<P>Applicant's financial indebtedness remains current and he has not made a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On January 31, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 7, 2005, February 24, 2005 and March 21, 2005, in which he elected to have the case determined 
on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of twenty-two 
Government Exhibits referred to in the record as Government Exhibits 1 through 22 to the Applicant on June 8, 2005.  The Applicant was instructed to submit 
information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on June 23, 2005, and he submitted no reply.  The 
case was received by the undersigned for decision on August 3, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the contents of the FORM.  The Applicant is 49 years old.  He is 
employed by a defense contractor as an Analyst and is seeking to obtain his security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a nineteen year history of financial indebtedness that began in 1986 and continues to the present.  The Applicant's financial problems began 
with the death of his father-in-law in 1986.  Three years later, in 1989, the Applicant, who was in the military at the time, was assigned overseas and left his 
family behind.  In 1991, he returned stateside and received orders to move again.  These events caused financial strain.  The Applicant also believes that these 
series of moves may have caused the bills not to be forwarded to him for payment.  To deal with these financial problems the Applicant discovered a facility 
that would advance a portion of his paycheck to him.  He used this service routinely which only caused more financial difficulties.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 
10 and 11). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, the Department of the Navy issued the Applicant a Letter of Intent alleging that his excessive indebtedness and recurring financial difficulties were a 
potential security risk.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 16).  The Applicant was ultimately awarded a conditional security determination in August 1996, based on 
evidence presented in his June 13, 1996, answer that he was making payments to creditors and was working with a consumer credit counselor to improve his 
finances.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 12). Since then, the Applicant's manner of handling his financial affairs has not improved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy to discharge his debts of approximately $210,702.50.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibits 18 and 19).  Two years 
later, in March 2000, his wife had open heart surgery and could no longer work.  As a result, their automobiles were repossessed, and their financial situation 
grew even more dismal.  In 2002, both his mother and his mother-in-law passed away.  Each of these events caused the Applicant to spend money he had not 
planned on spending and caused additional financial strain.  Presently, the Applicant is financially over-extended and unable to pay his monthly obligations.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits to all of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Answer to SOR).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Credit reports of the Applicant indicate that he is indebted to six different creditors, totaling an approximate amount in excess of $6,000.00.  (<EM>See </EM>Government 
Exhibits 20, 21 and 22).  According to these credit reports each of the debts listed in the SOR remain outstanding and delinquent.  The Applicant contends that 
he has paid off all of his past due creditors by refinancing his house, however he provides no documentary evidence to support this.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Answer to 
SOR).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's personal financial statement dated July 23, 2003, shows that he has a net remainder of negative $871.00 after paying his monthly expenses, 
which does not include repayments on his delinquent accounts set forth in the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 10).    </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN>None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence indicates 
poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is 
a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  With respect to his finances, the Applicant has a long history of financial indebtedness.  Admittedly, he has encountered circumstances 
beyond his control that have aggravated his financial problems.  Under ordinary circumstances these events beyond his control can be considered mitigating.  
However, in this case, after filing bankruptcy in 1989, and discharging approximately $210,000.00 in debt, the Applicant was completely debt free.  He 
discharged all of his debt except his house and car payment.  At that point, no matter what was to happen in life, he should have been able to manage his 
financial affairs without getting too deeply in debt again.  This was not the case.  Along with more unexpected problems came more debt and an inability to 
properly manage his finances.  He over-extended himself, made poor financial decisions and again arrived in a situation where he was excessively financially 
indebted.  He now contends that he has paid them off by refinancing his house, but there is no documentary evidence to support this.  I cannot find that this 
blind assertion without proof is credible.  I have no proof in the record that his outstanding debts have been paid or that he has changed his method of financial 
management.  I find all of the alleged debts to be valid and owing and that his financial indebtedness has not been resolved.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon review of his financial statement,  it appears that he does not have disposable income at the end of the month that he could use to pay his past due debts. 
There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) A history of not meeting financial 
obligations </EM>and <EM>(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply.  His financial problems remain current 
(MC)1; they are not isolated, (MC) 2; and the Applicant has not initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts (MC) 
3<EM>.</EM>  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.     </SPAN></P>
