<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR), dated July 14, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to
an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,
or denied. The SOR was based on foreign preference (guideline C) related to his exercise of dual
citizenship with the United States and England and foreign influence (guideline B) concerns because
of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated August 2, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the
SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 2, 2004, the case
was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated February 14, 2004, a
hearing was held on March 17, 2004. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits
1- 4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through counsel,  offered three documentary exhibits
(Exhibits A-C) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on March 31, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative
Guideline C (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Preference</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR
contains  three allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline C and five allegations, 2.a. through
2.e., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1.c., 2.a., and 2.d.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Those
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's
Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of Applicant, and upon due
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is 59 years old. He is employed as an engineering manager by a United States
defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance. He has been employed by this
company since 1982. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant was born in England. He came to the United States on a two year work visa. Three
months later, his wife and four children arrived in the United States.  He became a United States
citizen in 1990. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">		</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph
that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a
preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Despite the fact that Applicant obtained a United States passport after he became a U.S.
citizen,  he renewed his English  passport in May of  2000. He testified that he did this with the idea
that it might be beneficial to use this passport in the event of a highjacking (Tr at 17). With the
exception of one occasion, where he inadvertently entered the wrong line at an airport, he never used
his English passport after he became a United States citizen. In 2004, when he became aware of the
requirements under the Money memorandum, he returned his English to the British consulate
General (Exhibits B and C).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	 Applicant testified that it was his belief that when he became a United States citizen in 1990,
he renounced his English citizenship (Tr at 29). It is now his understanding that the British
government does not revoke British citizenship, even when an individual becomes a citizen of
another country, but if he could revoke his British citizenship he testified that he would (Tr at 37,
38). </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom
he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be
subject to duress. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's wife and two sons, aged 28 and 30, are British citizens who have resided in the
United States since 1979. None of the three has made the effort to become U. S. Citizens, although,
both sons are married to and have children who are U.S. citizens.  His two daughters,  ages 31 and
38, are dual citizens of England and the United States. Both of them have served in the United States
Air Force. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's sister lives in England and is an English citizen . He communicates with her
regularly. He also has three aunts and two sisters-in-law, who live in England and are English
citizens (Tr at 39-41).  None of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any
government agency of England. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	 Applicant received an inheritance from his father's estate. He made two transfers of $125,
000 and $58,000  to a United States bank , and he virtually closed out that account (Tr at 24,  Exhibit
A).  He estimates his financial holdings in this country to be worth approximately three hundred
thousand dollars (Tr at 32, 33).						</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the
Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the
pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative
decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and
surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and
maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which
the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences
involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the
potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct
will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be
assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in
every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be
sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available
information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The following guidelines and concerns are relevant to this case:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference
for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or
make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">						</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">					<STRONG>Guideline B Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,
or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,
exploitation or pressure.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to
grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do
so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common
sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and
conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the
trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.
Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a
security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present
evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence
of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.			</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with
national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive,
Section E2.2.2.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with
respect to guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign
country over the United States. Applicant's renewal of a British passport after becoming a United
States citizen raises some foreign preference (guideline C) concerns. Disqualifying condition (DC)
E2.A3.1.2.1., the exercise of dual citizenship applies. I rule that DC E2.A3.1.2.2, the possession a
foreign passport, also applies. However,  Applicant never was aware of the restriction of renewing
a passport of a country other than the United States. When he became aware of the requirements
under the Money Memorandum,  he returned his British passport to the British Consulate General.
It is also significant that with the exception of one inadvertent usage, he only used his United States
passport after becoming a U. S. Citizen</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant testified that he was willing to renounce his British passport.  Mitigating Condition
( MC) E2.A3.1.3.4, an expressed  willingness to renounce dual citizenship, applies. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,
are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. The evidence of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> immediate family
members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens of England and some who also reside in England, comes within DC
E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">		</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">				</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including the lack
of government involvement of Applicant's family members and Applicant's extremely strong
attachment to his family in the United States, and his significant financial interests here,  I have
determined that his family members, here or in England, do not constitute an unacceptable security
risk and come within MC E2.A2.1.3.1., a determination that the immediate family member(s) in
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the
United States. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating
evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event
pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would reject it, and
would  report the incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
