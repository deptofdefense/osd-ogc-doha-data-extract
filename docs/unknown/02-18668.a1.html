  Board cannot consider in a vacuum, without reference to a properly developed record, whether a document was properly excluded by an Administrative Judge.  If a party wishes to preserve its appeal rights on an evidentiary issue, then that party must take basic, minimum steps to preserve the  record so that the Board can address that evidentiary issue on appeal.  Under the Directive, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion as to obtaining a  favorable security clearance decision.  That heavy burden is not diminished, lessened, or reduced by the fact that Taiwan is not a country that is hostile to the  United States.  Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is bifurcated in nature.  The Judge's favorable conclusions under Guideline B were based on  unwarranted assumptions and lacked sufficient record evidence to support them.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated December 26, 2002 which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  
Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a favorable security clearance decision dated June 11, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by refusing to take administrative or official notice of three 
documents; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's ties with immediate family members in Taiwan were mitigated 
sufficiently to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Judge's security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by refusing to take administrative or official notice of three documents</SPAN>.  At the hearing, Department Counsel asked 
the Administrative Judge to take administrative notice of three documents.  Applicant objected.  After conducting a discussion with both counsel about the 
documents, the Judge ruled that he would not take administrative notice of any of the three documents (Hearing Transcript at pp. 16-24).  Department Counsel 
contends the Judge erred by not taking administrative notice of the three documents.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's appeal brief asserts that documents for which administrative or official notice was requested were "[offered] for the purposes of Judicial 
Notice, not as evidence in the case at hand."  Department Counsel cites no legal authority in support of its position.  Even under the relaxed evidentiary 
standards applicable in these proceedings (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.19), administrative or official notice is not something <EM>sui 
generis</EM> that is totally unconnected to or independent from basic, minimum principles of evidence law.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  However, the Board rejects Applicant's argument that 
administrative or official notice in DOHA proceedings must strictly comply with the Federal Rules of Evidence.  With one exception not applicable to this 
appeal,<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Item E3.1.19 of the Additional Procedural Guidance indicates that the Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a guide, not a strict requirement.  
Furthermore, administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Copies of the three documents in question are not in the case file.  The Board cannot consider in a vacuum, without reference to a properly developed record, 
whether a document was properly excluded by an Administrative Judge.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  There is no indication from the hearing transcript that Department Counsel asked the 
Judge to mark the documents for identification and place them in the case file to preserve Department Counsel's appeal rights with respect to the Judge's ruling 
on the three documents.  If a party wishes to preserve its appeal rights on an evidentiary issue, then that party must take basic, minimum steps to preserve the 
record so that the Board can address that evidentiary issue on appeal.  In this case, Department Counsel did not take sufficient steps to preserve the issue for 
appeal so that the Board could make a reasoned decision as to whether the  Judge erred by excluding the three documents in question.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's ties with immediate family members in Taiwan were mitigated sufficiently to warrant 
a favorable security clearance decision</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with immediate family members in Taiwan were mitigated 
sufficiently to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  Department Counsel contends the Judge's conclusion should not be sustained because: (a) the 
record evidence does not support the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>; and (b) the specific reasons the Judge gave for his 
favorable conclusion do not support it.  Applicant contends that the record evidence does support the Judge's favorable conclusion, and that the Board decisions 
relied on by Department Counsel are distinguishable on their facts from Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that Applicant "is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Applicant has a heavy burden to satisfy in these proceedings because:</P> 
 
<P>(a) there is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance;<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>(b) a favorable security clearance decision cannot be made unless there is an affirmative finding that it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant 
or continue a security clearance for an applicant<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>; and</P> 
 
<P>(c) even a close case must be resolved in favor of the national security.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The heavy burden of persuasion that Applicant has to meet is not diminished, lessened or reduced by the fact that Taiwan is not a country that is hostile to the 
United States.  Nothing in Guideline B (Foreign Influence) indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  
Furthermore, the United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is 
not authorized to have access to it,<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Finally, 
history shows that individuals have disclosed classified information to foreign entities or countries that are not considered to be hostile to the United States.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is bifurcated in nature and precludes an Administrative Judge from applying 
it merely based on the conclusion that an applicant's immediate family members in a foreign country are not agents of a foreign power.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the 
Judge's conclusion that there is no evidence that Applicant's immediate family members are connected with the Taiwanese government, the Taiwanese 
military, or Taiwanese intelligence services (Decision at p. 4) is not sufficient to support his application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues the Administrative Judge made an unwarranted assumption about what the Taiwanese government believes is an 
acceptable risk to take in connection with its relationship with the United States.  There is no record evidence that would allow the Judge to make any finding of 
fact or reach a reasoned conclusion as to what the Taiwanese government believes is or is not an acceptable risk to take in connection with its relationship with 
the United States.  Furthermore, the Judge's assumption is not tenable as a general proposition because it ignores the historical reality (noted by Department 
Counsel on appeal) that there have been cases where individuals have committed espionage against the United States by passing classified information to 
countries that are not considered hostile to the United States.  Such espionage cases indicate that countries not hostile to the United States are capable of 
deciding that receiving classified information from a person engaged in espionage against the United States is worth the risk that such espionage might damage 
their relationship with the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that foreign influence or pressure under Guideline B is not limited to coercive means of influence or pressure.<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  However, 
the Board does not find persuasive Department Counsel's argument that the Administrative Judge analyzed Applicant's case </P> 
 
<P>only in terms of the potential for coercive means of influence or pressure being used.  Applicant's argument to the contrary is more persuasive. </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues that (a) the federal government is not required to prove that an applicant <EM>would</EM> compromise classified information if a 
foreign government approaches the applicant directly or through immediate family members living abroad<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>; and (b) the Administrative Judge had insufficient 
record evidence to conclude that Applicant would act properly if the Taiwanese government were to try to gain unauthorized access to classified information 
through coercive or noncoercive means brought to bear on him or his immediate family members in Taiwan.  Although security clearance decisions are not an 
exact science and involve predictive judgments,<A HREF="02-18668.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> an Administrative Judge must make predictive judgments that have a rational basis in the record evidence 
and are not based on unwarranted assumptions.</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge cannot make a favorable security clearance decision unless the Judge articulates a rational basis for concluding it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  Here, the Judge failed to articulate a sustainable basis for his favorable 
security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated error below that warrants reversal of the decision below.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.33.3, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>
