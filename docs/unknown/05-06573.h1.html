<P>On December 29, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN>On December 5, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR 
alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In a one-page, notarized, written answer, dated January 4, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> was provided to him on May 4, 2006, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
Any such submissions were due by June 3, 2006.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He did not respond. Department Counsel submitted the FORM on June 23, 2006. The case was assigned to me on June 26, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The response to the SOR included admissions to all material factual allegations under Guidelines H (subparagraphs 1.a. to 1.g.) and E (subparagraph 2a.).<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>From August 1, 2002, to December 29, 2003 (the date of his SF 86), Applicant has been employed in sales, and he also began working for a defense contractor as a consultant about two months before 
completing his SF 86.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SUP> He is 34-years-old,<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and is seeking a security clearance. From 1993 to 2003, he attended college<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SUP> and was employed by thirteen different organizations, as well as being 
unemployed on several occasions.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SUP>  The quality of his employment performance has not been characterized. He received a Bachelor of Science degree on August 1, 1994.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SUP> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From October 1, 2002, until November 27, 2003, Applicant  used crystal methamphetamine at least six times,<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> as well as GHB, ecstasy and cocaine each at least three times.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He also purchased

</P> 
 
<P>In their evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge should consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC).  An administrative judge may consider relevant DCs to 
deny or revoke and MCs to grant an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction with 
the factors listed in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense 
decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine Adjudicative Process factors listed at E2.2.1 of the 
Directive: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) 
the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual</STRONG></SPAN>'<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>s willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse 
or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the 
Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided 
drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's access to classified information. If the government meets its initial burden, the Applicant then has a heavy burden of persuasion, that is to 
present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and ultimately to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue the Applicant's clearance.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours 
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned." Security clearance decisions 
cover many characteristics of an Applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon considering of all the facts in evidence, and after applying all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following  with respect to 
the allegations set forth in the SOR:     </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline H. Applicant's improper and illegal use of marijuana is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. The 
Directive clearly expresses the government's concern regarding drug involvement in provision </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.1.1. "<EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's 
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information</EM>." Drug abuse is defined in provision E2.A8.1.1.3. as "<EM>The illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction</EM>." Provision E2.A8.1.1.2.1. 
generally identifies and defines drugs as "<EM>Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens</EM>)."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The overall conduct  pertaining to Applicant's illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>any drug abuse</EM>) and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. 
(<EM>illegal drug possession</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has established his use and purchase of illegal drugs.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions do not support the application of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1. (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>),<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> or DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3. (<EM>a demonstrated 
intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">There is no "bright line" rule for determining when conduct is "recent." The determination must be based "on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the 
directive."<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> If the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates 
"changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation."<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">On January 4, 2006, in response to the SOR, Applicant stated he recognized that using drugs is destructive and he stopped his drug abuse.<A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> He did not explicitly indicate how long he had abstained 
from drug purchase and use, nor did he provide a detailed description of when his lifestyle changed. He did not provide any supporting evidence corroborating his asserted lifestyle, attitude or conduct 
changes. For example, evidence was provided from friends, family, co-workers or a myriad of other potential references, attesting to his change in behavior or attitude. In his favor, there is no evidence 
in the file that he used or purchased illegal drugs after November 27, 2003. One aspect that weighs against him is the nature of the drugs he abused. Cocaine and crystal methamphetamine are widely 
known to be addictive.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SUP> He admitted he used cocaine three times and crystal methamphetamine five times.<SUP><A HREF="05-06573.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> Applicant has not met his burden of showing his drug use and purchase was "not recent." 
Accordingly, I conclude DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1. is not established</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant's promise not to use drugs in the future raised DI MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">E2.A8.1.3.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">As to his future intentions, he expressed a clear and 
unambiguous intent to discontinue drug abuse. Applicant's promise, however, does not demonstrate intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. Based on the record evidence, I am not confident that his 
substance abuse will not recur. In the absence of a longer period of abstinence, and better evidence concerning his intentions, it is premature to conclude with reasonable certainty that his substance 
abuse is safely of the past.  I conclude his promise not to abuse drugs in the future is insufficient to establish DI MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">E2.A8.1.3.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">mitigated the security concerns, pertaining to drug 
involvement.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

to comply with federal laws prohibiting possession of illegal drugs.<SUP> </SUP> Under  E2.A5.1.1., such conduct could indicate he may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant's actions in this regard fall within Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.4. (<EM>personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible 
to blackmail</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">He is more vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress because of his drug involvement. It is beyond cavil that information about his drug abuse, if known, could adversely affect his 
personal, professional, or community standing. I conclude that his drug involvement has  enhanced his susceptibility to blackmail.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">As noted above, Applicant's conduct was predominately drug-related, but also criminal.  And, because it involved questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability, personal conduct becomes 
an issue, however redundant.  Applicant's repeated violations of the law</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> and DoD policy, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">fall within PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5.

drugs when he was already 31 years old, including drug use while holding a United States Postal Service Sensitive Clearance. His multiple uses of illegal drugs over a 14-month time </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">period constitute a 
pattern of rule violations.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN></P>

abstinence from drug use is not established and the corroborating evidence of a change of lifestyle is sparse.
