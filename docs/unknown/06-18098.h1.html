</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and 
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR). That SOR detailed reasons why, pursuant to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. In his response, dated September 7, 2006, Applicant admitted all eight of the 
allegations contained in the SOR. Additionally, he requested an administrative determination based on the written record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on October 4, 2006, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to Applicant.

receipt of the FORM. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I was assigned this case on November 29, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admission to all of the allegations set forth in the SOR are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 49 years old and is a technical fellow working for a defense contractor. He has been employed by his current employer </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">since May 1995. He was born a in city within the Hunan 
Province of the People's Republic of China (PRC). He was raised in that country and eventually went to the United Kingdom for graduate studies. He received a Doctor of Philosophy degree from 
Cambridge University in England in 1986, a year after marrying his present wife in Shanghai, PRC.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Around 1990, Applicant and his wife emigrated to the United States and, at some indeterminate time, applied for United States citizenship. In 1992, they had a son, a citizen of the United States of 
America by virtue of his birth in this country. In 1995, Applicant commenced his present employment and moved into his present home. On October 11, 1999, his passport from PRC expired and, 
on November 10, 1999, he and his wife became naturalized United States citizens. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Remaining in PRC is Applicant's mother, a retired accountant who formerly was employed by a county government within the Hunan Province. There is no evidence as to whether she receives a 
government pension or other benefits for her governmental service. Like their mother, two of Applicant's brothers and his sister are citizens and residents of PRC. Applicant is in contact with these 
relatives about three times per year. He visited them in PRC once, from December 30, 2004, to January 5, 2005. Applicant also has a mother-in-law living in PRC. His wife maintains telephonic 
contact with her mother one to two times per month. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a third brother, a citizen and resident of Japan. He has not visited him in the past seven years, if ever, but they speak telephonically at least once a month. There are no other facts 
regarding this brother, his work, or his relationship to the governments of Japan or PRC. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because Applicant chose not to provide additional information regarding his family or his life, and because he chose to have a determination based solely on the record, there are few  relevant facts 
of record. Only three additional facts are noted by Applicant. In his SOR response, he stated:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">1. All the reasons listed in the Statement of Reasons are normal family contacts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">All my relatives are ordinary people with ordinary jobs. None of my relatives is an </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">agent of any foreign power and none of them is in a position to be exploited by a foreign </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">power in any way to force me to betray my loyalty to the United States. (E2.A1.1.3.1)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">2. My contacts with my relatives are casual and infrequent. For example, during </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">the 16 years since I came to the US in 1990, I only visited my relatives in China once in</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">2004 (E2.A2.1.3.3)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">3. I have reported all my contacts with my relatives in my application for the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> security clearance. (E2.A2.1.3.4)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant 
and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although 
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured 
against this policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> The government has 
the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>

<P>him.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN> Any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> The decision to deny an individual a 
security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive applies with respect to 
the allegations set forth in the SOR</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an 
individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits that his mother, two brothers, and a sister are citizens and residents of PRC, and that he 
has a brother who is a citizen and resident of Japan. The citizenship and residency of these family members raises a security concern under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 
E2.A2.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When, as here, the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or 
mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. With regard to his mother, Applicant has only acknowledged that she is a former accountant, retired from 
employment with a county government within the Hunan Province, PRC. He provides no information with regard to his siblings or either their employment or their relationship with their national 
governments. Instead, he makes the blanket statement that his relatives are "ordinary people with ordinary jobs. None of my relatives is an agent of any foreign power and none of them is in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in any way," without providing sufficient facts for an independent assessment of their potential for causing him duress, or their vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure. Because Applicant has failed to provide any substantial facts regarding these individuals upon which security risk assessment can be made, Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>determination that the family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sons), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>) cannot be 
applied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has depicted his personal contacts with his family as casual and infrequent. He maintains contact with his mother and siblings in PRC about three times a year, and has only visited them 
in the PRC one time since he emigrated to this country, 16 years ago. There is no evidence showing that there is additional contact or that he maintains alternative contact by sending gifts or money. 
Based on these facts, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 ([<EM>c</EM>]<EM>ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>) </SPAN>applies with regard to Applicant's blood relatives in PRC. The same cannot 
be said, however, with regard to his third brother or his mother-in-law. He regularly maintains contact with his brother in Japan, at least once a month by telephone. While there is no evidence from 
which to ascertain their degree of sibling intimacy, such contact, based on the few facts available, is brotherly, regular, and not infrequent. Similarly, his wife maintains contact with Applicant's 
mother-in-law in PRC one or two times a month. Because the relationship between spouses and their foreign relatives can be ascribed to an applicant in these cases,<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> such regular contact, without 
more information, must be found to be regular and intimate. Therefore, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 does not apply to these two relatives.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this matter, Applicant's foreign contacts are family, not associates or friends. Consequently, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>c</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>ontacts</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>with foreign citizens are a result of official United States Government 
business</EM>) does not apply. For similar reasons, and because there is no issue questioning Applicant's disclosure of his relatives' citizenship, FI MC E1.A2.1.3.4 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">[</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>t</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>he individual has promptly 
reported to proper</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>authorities all contacts, requests, or threats from persons or organizations from a foreign country, as required</EM>) does not apply. There is also no question in this matter 
concerning Applicant having foreign investments or holdings abroad, obviating consideration of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>f</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>oreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the 
individual's security responsibilities</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Also integral to assessments of this kind is an examination of the countries at issue. The government expressed no particular urgency with regard to Japan, a constitutional monarchy with a prime 
minister as head of the government, except the general concern regarding any foreign influence. It presented copious information, however, with regard to PRC.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> PRC is an authoritarian state 
whose power is centralized in the Chinese Communist Party.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> PRC historically has a poor human rights record and its citizens lack freedom to peacefully express opposition to the political system 
or to freely change those in charge of the government<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The Government is responsible for committing numerous and serious abuses of human rights.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Those seeking to discuss change or who 
express dissenting political views are subject to arrest and harassment.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> PRC does not have an independent judiciary nor are their citizens afforded due process rights.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> Consequently, concerns 
regarding <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure are valid.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in this case, and the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant is a mature, 
exceptionally well-educated man, who quickly and successfully assimilated to life in the United States. He and his wife emigrated to this country as adults from PRC, and their son was born in this 
country. Applicant has held the same job and lived in the same home for over a decade. </P> 
 
<P>Outside of their life in the United States are Applicant's mother, two brothers, a sister, and his mother-in-law, who are residents and citizens of PRC. There is also a brother, a former citizen of 
PRC, who is now a resident and citizen of Japan. With the limited information Applicant has provided, a careful assessment of their relationships with associates and the governments of PRC and 
Japan, respectively, cannot be made.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN> Further, the close and regular contact Applicant's wife has with her mother, and the contact Applicant maintains with his brother in Japan, create a position of 
potential vulnerability for all involved. This vulnerability could be exploited by the authoritarian PRC government or foreign agents in a way that could force Applicant to choose between his 
loyalty to his wife, family, mother-in-law, and his loyalty to the U.S. </P> 
 
<P>Although there is no basis in the record to question Applicant's character or integrity, the DOHA Appeal Board has determined that even good people can pose security risks.<A HREF="06-18098.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
<P> Here, after 
considering the whole person with the scant facts available, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised. Consequently, based on the totality of the evidence 
in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against Applicant. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
