<P>Applicant has mitigated personal conduct concerns resulting from her fraudulent use of another person's credit account on a government computer.  However, 
she has failed to mitigate financial concerns arising from eleven delinquent debts totaling $13,497.00.  Applicant has only corroborated her payoff of one 
$48.00 debt and a $60.00 payment on a $229.00 obligation.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-21046.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense 
Directive,<A HREF="02-21046.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).  The SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified 
information and recommends that her case be submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
<P>On January 14, 2004, DOHA received Applicant's answer to the SOR in which she requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2004.  A 
notice of hearing was issued on May 21, 2004, and the hearing was held on June 10, 2004.  During the hearing, four Government exhibits (Govt Ex), six 
Applicant exhibits (Ap Ex), and the testimony of Applicant were received.  Without objection by Department Counsel, I allowed Applicant until July 8, 2004 to 
submit proof of payments of debts.  There is no evidence in the file that Applicant made a submission.  The transcript (Tr) was received on June 29, 2004.   </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 26-year-old senior network specialist employed by a defense contractor.  She is a valued and respected employee of her company and is seeking a 
security clearance.</P> 
<P>In July 1999, Applicant opened a credit account with a department store.  She incurred a $229.00 debt that she did not paid.  (SOR &para; 2.d.)</P> 
<P>Between August 16 and 24, 2000, while a member of the United States Army, Applicant used another person's credit card to purchase merchandise of more 
than $1,000.00 in value, including a camcorder and a TV/VCR.  She made the purchases online using a government computer and had the merchandise sent to 
her address.  Applicant was charged with larceny of private funds, computer fraud and mail fraud.  In lieu of court-martial, she was administratively separated 
from the Army and received an other than honorable discharge on December 27, 2000.  At the time of her discharge, Applicant had completed two years, 11 
months, and 14 days of military service.  (SOR &para; 1.a.)</P> 
<P>In July 2001,  a collection account was opened against Applicant in the amount of $1,919.00 for unpaid cable service.  She testified she had reduced the amount 
to $319.14 by returning equipment and had entered into a payment plan to pay $52.00 per month.  However, Applicant has not provided any documentation or 
other evidence to corroborate this.  (SOR &para; 2.h.)</P> 
<P>In August 2001, Applicant opened a credit card account with a bank.  She incurred a $1,046.00 debt that she did not paid.  The bank charged it off as a bad debt.  
(SOR &para; 2.a.)</P> 
<P>In August 2001, Applicant opened a second credit card account with a bank.  She incurred a $1,453.00 debt that she did not paid.  The bank charged it off as a 
bad debt.  (SOR &para; 2.b.)</P> 
<P>In August 2001, a collection account was opened against Applicant for an unpaid doctor's bill in the amount of $227.00.  Applicant testified she had agreed to 
pay off the bill by making two payments in June 2004.  However, she has not provided corroboration of any payment.  (SOR &para; 2.g.)</P> 
<P>In September 2001, a judgment was entered against Applicant in the amount of $1,502.00 for unpaid rent of an apartment.  (SOR &para; 2.j.)  In December 2001, 
another judgment was awarded against Applicant in the amount of $1,265.00 for cleaning costs related to the same apartment.  (SOR &para; 2.k.)</P> 
<P>In January 2002, a collection account was opened against Applicant in the amount of $4,943.00. She has not paid the debt.  (SOR &para; 2.c.)</P> 
<P>In March 2002, a collection account was opened against Applicant for an unpaid newspaper account in the amount of $48.00.  On June 9, 2004, Applicant paid 
the account in full.  (SOR &para; 2.f.)</P> 
<P>In May 2002, a collection account was opened against Applicant in the amount of $298.00 for an unpaid hospital bill.  On June 1, 2004, she made a $60.00 
payment on the account.  (SOR &para; 2.e.)</P> 
<P>In August 2002, a judgment was awarded against Applicant in the amount of $567.00 for unpaid rent.  Applicant testified she paid the judgment in cash and 
obtained a receipt.  However, she has not provided any corroboration of the payment.  (SOR &para; 2.i.)</P> 
<P>On July 18, 2003, the Army Discharge Review Board affirmed the basis for Applicant's discharge but changed the characterization of her service to general, 
under honorable conditions.  The Board cited the length and quality of her military service and her post-service conduct and accomplishments.  (SOR &para; 1.a.) </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information</EM> <EM>Within Industry </EM>&sect; 2 (February 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions  for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the conditions listed in the Directive's guidelines and the applicant's security worthiness.   <EM>See 
</EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (May 2, 1996). (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (December 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Any doubt as to whether access to classified 
information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: Personal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline E is conduct involving questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  &para; E2.A5.1.1.  Conditions that could  raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E include &para; E2.A5.1.2.5 (Disqualifying Condition 5).  Disqualifying Condition 5 addresses <EM>a pattern 
of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record establishes that Applicant repeatedly used another person's credit information in order to fraudulently obtain merchandise.   Moreover, she did so by 
misusing a government computer to conduct the transactions online.  This establishes Disqualifying Condition 5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct resulted in her administrative separation from the United States Army.  Aside from a minor infraction that resulted in an Article 15 
punishment, it was the only blemish on Applicant's military record that spanned nearly three years.  Since being discharged from the Army, Applicant has 
distinguished herself with her performance as an employee of a defense contractor.  Due to these facts, the Army Discharge Review Board has seen fit to 
upgrade the characterization of Applicant's military service to a general discharge under honorable conditions.  Applicant regrets her actions and it does not 
appear from the record that she is likely to repeat such conduct.  Having mitigated her actions, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: Financial Considerations</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline F is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The 
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include <EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>, &para; 
E2.A6.1.2.1 (Disqualifying Condition 1).  They also include <EM>an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>, &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (Disqualifying Condition 3). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record establishes both Disqualifying Condition 1 and Disqualifying Condition 3.   Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as 
his inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts as reflected by having incurred eleven delinquent debts, totaling $13,497.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline F include &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (Mitigating Condition 6).  Mitigating Condition 6 is applicable when 
<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her testimony, Applicant admitted all of the debts addressed by SOR &para; 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, and 2.g but has failed to demonstrate her mitigation of any of them.  She 
testified she had worked out a payment plan to repay the debts addressed by SOR &para; 2.a and 2.b and had made one combined payment of $350.00.  However, 
Applicant failed to provide corroboration of either the payment plan or the payment.  Applicant acknowledged that she had not yet made any payment of the 
debt addressed by SOR &para; 2.c.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claimed the judgments addressed by SOR &para; 2.j and 2.k are the same debts that constitute the debt addressed by SOR &para; 2.c, she failed to 
provide any corroboration for this.  Moreover, her contention was inconsistent with her answer to the SOR.  In that response, Applicant admitted both 
judgments and asserted she had paid the judgment addressed by SOR &para; 2.j.  She offered no explanation for the inconsistency.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied she was indebted for the debts addressed by SOR &para; 2.d-2.f.  In her testimony, however, she admitted all of them.  
Applicant provided corroboration of a payment of $60.00 on the $298.00 debt addressed by SOR &para; 2.e and her $48.00 payoff of the debt addressed by SOR &para; 
2.f.  In accordance with Mitigating Condition 6, the latter is the only delinquent debt of the eleven addressed by the SOR that Applicant has mitigated.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claimed that she had reduced the debt addressed by SOR &para; 2.h from $1,919.00 to $319.00 by returning equipment, she failed to provide any 
corroboration of this.  She also failed to corroborate her alleged payoff of the judgment addressed by SOR &para; 2.i.  Applicant claimed she had made a $567.00 
cash payment but did not produce the receipt or other confirmation from the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified her current income provides her with approximately $600.00 per month after the payment of her bills.  It would appear that she has the 
financial resources to address her delinquent debts.  However, Applicant has failed to corroborate her satisfaction of any of the delinquent debts addressed by 
the SOR except for SOR &para; 2.f.  Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 2.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
