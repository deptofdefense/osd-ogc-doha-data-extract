<P>Applicant is 27 years old and works for a federal contractor. Applicant was arrested, charged and/or convicted of numerous criminal offenses from January 
1995 through April 2000. Some of the offenses involved the selling of drugs, others were obstructing a police officer, and one was for strong armed robbery. 
Applicant's criminal history is extensive, as is his drug history. Applicant deliberately omitted his criminal history, drug history and other requested information 
on his security clearance application. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct, personal conduct and drug 
involvement. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges 
security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline H, drug involvement considerations.</P> 
<P>Applicant provided two statements to the SOR that were deemed unresponsive and were returned to him. Applicant's final response dated August 4, 2004 was 
deemed appropriate. In it Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, admitting them all, and provided an explanation in extenuation and mitigation. Applicant 
elected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government's case on April 8, 2005. Department Counsel moved to 
amend the SOR to clarify specific allegations and requested Applicant to file any objection to the amendment and respond to the modified allegations. A file of 
relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on April 15, 2005 and received on May 5, 2005. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object nor did he file any additional evidence to be considered. The case was 
assigned to me on June 15, 2005.       </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements, I

includes the above mentioned arrests and charges. Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f. of the SOR that he falsified material 
facts on his SF 86. The specific falsifications are provided below.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered "No" to Question 19 on his SF 86 (<EM>Your Medical Record-In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, 
psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider about a mental health related condition?) </EM>Applicant attended court 
ordered drug counseling from June 15, 2000 to September 14, 2000. He did not provide this information at the time he filled out the SF 86. Applicant claimed 
he did not know that this question included his drug counseling. Applicant did not provide any additional information with regards to whether he followed up 
on the treatment recommendations. </P> 
<P>In response to Question 21 (<EM>You Police Record-Felony Offenses</EM>-<EM>Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? For this item, report 
information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is

requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 
U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.)</EM> Applicant failed to disclose any of the criminal offenses for which he was arrested.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered "No" to Question 27 <EM>(Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity-Illegal Use of Drugs. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, which

he was told to put on his SF 86 all of his arrests, but he missed some because he thought that the request was only for felonies.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant admitted allegation 
3.b. that he used marijuana two to three times a week from about 1996 to on or about 1998. He claimed he did not list his drug use because he thought the use

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline H, drug involvement considerations, with their respective DC and MC, apply in 
this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and 
circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and 
surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to 
which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) 
the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Once 
the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</P> 
<P>him.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</P> 
<P>Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P>Guideline H-Drug Involvement is a security concern because improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness 
or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. </P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline J, Guideline E, and Guideline H.</P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged)</EM>, and E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>apply. Applicant was arrested, charged with, 
and convicted for various and numerous offenses from 1995 through 2000, including misdemeanors and felonies.</P> 
<P>I considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent);</EM> CC MC E2.10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident); </EM>CC MC E2.10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur)</EM>; and CC MC E2.10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.)</EM>. I conclude none of the 
mitigating conditions apply. Although Applicant was first arrested as a juvenile, he continued to be arrested for violating the law when he obtained the age of 
majority. Applicant's disregard and lack of respect for the law is apparent when considering some of his arrests were within a short period of time of each other, 
and many for the same or similar offenses. Applicant was given opportunities by the judicial system through probation and dispositions held in abeyance to 
change his behavior, but he squandered them. As late as April 5, 2000 Applicant was charged with a probation violation, possession of cocaine, and obstructing 
or opposing an officer without violence. His probation was terminated. No information was provided as to his current probation status. Applicant's last alleged 
criminal offense was in 2000 and although this might not be considered recent, considering Applicant's consistent and increasingly more serious pattern of 
criminal conduct, not enough time has elapsed to mitigate it under CC MC E2.10.1.2.1. Applicant has failed to provide any evidence of successful rehabilitation 
or if he has completed any sentence that may have been awarded due to his probation being revoked. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns 
regarding his criminal conduct. </P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), </EM>PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging 
in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail),</EM> and PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency) 
</EM>apply in this case.</P> 
<P>Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed his extensive criminal record and drug history. He deliberately provided false answers on his SF 86 and did not 
divulge the information until confronted by an investigator. Applicant's conduct and concealment of information increases his vulnerability to exploitation and 
coercion. Applicant has shown through his criminal activity and by lying on numerous questions on his SF 86 a pattern of dishonesty and rule violations.</P> 
<P>I considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was an 
isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps 
to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant blatantly 
falsified his SF 86. He did not provide the correct information until confronted by an investigator. Applicant did not offer any information to show any steps he 
may have taken to reduce his vulnerability to coercion or exploitation. Applicant </P> 
<P>was obviously attempting to hide his past, which makes him especially vulnerable and unreliable. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security 
concerns. </P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>Any drug abuse<A HREF="02-19730.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>), </EM>and E2.A8.1.2.2 (<EM>Illegal drug possession, 
including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution)</EM> apply. Applicant admitted using marijuana two to three times a week from 1996 
to 1998. Applicant also was arrested and charged with multiple drug-related criminal offenses, involving the illegal possession of controlled substances. </P> 
<P>I considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>The drug involvement was 
not recent); </EM>E2.A8.1.3.2 <EM>( The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event); </EM>E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the 
future);</EM> and E2.A8.1.3.4 (<EM>Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without  
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.) </EM>I conclude none of these mitigating conditions apply. Although 
Applicant claims he has been "clean for three years" there is nothing to substantiate his claim. He has a lengthy history of drug involvement that includes using 
drugs, possessing and selling drugs. Applicant's involvement with drugs was not an isolated or aberrational event. Applicant did attend mandated drug 
counseling, but no information was provided about whether he followed up and completed the treatment recommendations. No information was provided by 
Applicant regarding his future intentions regarding drug use. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his drug involvement. </P> 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and drug 
involvement. Applicant's concealment and disregard for the truth is a grave and serious concern that reflects poorly on his character and judgment. Applicant's 
obvious lack of respect for the law is also a serious concern. Although Applicant claims he has been drug free for three years, based on his extensive 
involvement and lack of information about his potential rehabilitation raises a security concern. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this 
case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines J , E and H are decided against 
Applicant.</P>
