<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 21 July 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of security violations and personal conduct<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 28 August 2003 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned 
the case to me 24 September 2004 and I convened a hearing on 25 January 2005. DOHA received the transcript 2 February 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the SOR allegations, although he included explanatory material substantially admitting the underlying facts. He is a 59-year-old assistant vice 
president of a defense contractor, a job he has held since October 1998. He seeks continuation of the clearances he has held since he entered the U.S. Navy in 
July 1969, and transferred to his new employer in 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a retired Navy Captain (paygrade O-6), who served almost 30 years as a cryptographer. He has a bachelor's degree in physics, a master's degree in 
control engineering, a master of business administration degree in computer information systems, and has completed all the requirements for his doctorate in 
operations research, except the dissertation. He has an extensive post-graduate education and extraordinary career accomplishments (AE B).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In late 1995 or early 1996, toward the end of his command tour of a Navy information office, Applicant--who had been a note taker all during his Navy 
career--began to take classified notes in his personal notebook, an 8 x 11 binder.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He knew these notes were classified because he was careful to write as 
cryptically as possible to prevent anyone other than himself being able to readily identify the contents of the notes. No one knew he was taking classified notes. 
He did not ask permission to take classified notes. He did not advise his superiors that he was taking classified notes. He did not properly mark the notes he 
took as classified. He did not enter them into an accountability system. He did not destroy them. To the extent he kept his personal notebook in a SCIF (Special 
Compartmented Information Facility, an area approved for the open storage of classified material), the classified information was properly stored. Otherwise, it 
was not properly stored as it traveled with Applicant to his home and out of town on business, where he did not have approved storage containers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From May 1996 to October 1998, Applicant worked for the cognizant assistant secretary of defense as the office director in an emerging, and increasingly 
important, area of warfare. He considered it an exciting but stressful job (Tr. 97).  He continued to take classified notes of briefings he attended, although by 
this time he had switched to a more manageable 6 x 8 zippered notebook.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He was seldom without the notebook, but again, it traveled with him places where it 
was not properly secured, to his home and out of town on business, sometimes overseas.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1998, Applicant went on 90 days terminal leave from the Navy (his retirement was effective January 1999), and began work with his current 
employer. Although he intended to purge his notebook of classified information before leaving active duty, he did not do so. He took the notebook, with the 
classified notes, into retirement with him. Before retiring  he had completed debriefing forms and non-disclosure agreements that certified he had not retained 
any classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began to have misgivings about the notebook just before he retired. His sense that the notebook contained classified information began to bother him. 
He was uneasy about taking the notebook with him when he retired and meant to shred the classified pages, but never got around to it (Tr. 169). However, he 
continued to use the notebook in his new job. It continued to travel with him in an unsecured manner, to and from work, and overseas on business to Europe in 
November-December 1998 and February 1999. On one occasion overseas, it was left in his locked briefcase in an unattended cloakroom. Applicant thought 
about the notebook's contents occasionally, but took no action: "when I thought about it at all, I became afraid and tried to forget about the sensitive contents of 
the notebook entirely." (GE 2, 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1998, while going through his Navy records, Applicant discovered a 20-year old notebook containing classified calculations.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Although he was still 
technically in the Navy and could have easily returned the notebook to the Navy, he did not do so. Instead, he destroyed the notebook at home. He did not know 
if it had been declassified (Tr. 142). Later that month, he discovered a 10-12 page top secret document of more recent vintage and a six-page confidential 
document. He destroyed both at home,<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> denying the Navy the opportunity to conduct a damage assessment on the material.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1999, when he was confronted with taking a polygraph examination, Applicant disclosed information about his notebook and the classified 
documents he destroyed. In the subsequent investigation, Applicant discovered a number of other classified documents in his possession, some aged, some 
recent, some arguably unclassified but containing incorrect markings through administrative error (GE 4).<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> These he surrendered to the government, but the 
Navy command withdrew sponsorship of his clearance (GE 6). A damage assessment was done on the classified documents (Tr. 76-77), but that assessment did 
not become a part of the record other than determining that Applicant had not disclosed classified information to third parties, but had kept the classified 
information for his own use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had better reason than most to understand the proper handling of classified information.  Beyond his training in cryptography, a highly-classified 
operational field, he had problems with a polygraph in 1984 because he disclosed classified information to a subordinate not cleared for the information and he 
kept classified documents with him overnight on two occasions.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> In addition, throughout his career, he received periodic briefings on the handling requirements 
for classified information, including special programs he was read into. Indeed, Applicant testified: "I knew what the rules were" for properly handling and 
storing the classified material he was working with (Tr. 137-138).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant offered a variety of explanations for his conduct: he had always been the "go-to guy" in his Navy career and wanted to continue that role in his new 
job, although the assistant secretary of defense did not ask him to maintain those notes. He saw no other way to get the job done (Tr. 115). He was experiencing 
some health issues that were affecting his energy levels and stamina. He told himself that he was engaging in risk management, balancing competing issues of 
cost, mission, schedule, performance, and security (Tr. 110). However, he acknowledged that while he wrote as cryptically as he could, he was recording 
essentially everything that happened at the meetings he attended (Tr. 117). He claimed he was missing the accumulation of information in his notebook. He 
rationalized his note-taking. Ultimately, he acknowledged deliberately not facing the fact that he was creating classified notes (Tr. 179).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had an exemplary Navy career, during which he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Legion of Merit 
(twice), and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (AE A). His impressive list of character witnesses included a former assistant secretary of defense, two 
retired Navy rear admirals, a retired Army major general, and a senior career civil servant. All the witnesses had known Applicant over twenty years, personally 
and professionally; some had known him nearly thirty years.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> They all extol his honesty and integrity, his technical and professional competence, and his 
security consciousness--except for the incidents alleged in the SOR. Each is substantially, but not completely, aware of the allegations of the SOR. Each was 
surprised and disappointed to learn that Applicant had engaged in security violations, but believe he has owned up to his mistakes and learned from them, and is 
unlikely to commit them again. Each would grant Applicant his clearance. Tellingly, none of them condoned Applicant' security violations. And although each 
was in essentially the same line of work as Applicant, none of them ever committed the kind of security violations Applicant committed, and none of them ever 
had a subordinate who did so. Indeed, Applicant never had a subordinate commit a security violation during the command tour that earned him his second 
Legion of Merit. His company security manager reports that Applicant has been security conscious during his time at the company, and recommends retention 
of his clearance (AE C, Answer). His other character references also reach the same conclusion (AE D).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a loyal, patriotic American, and I believe him when he says he never intended to harm U.S. interests. Since his September 1999 polygraph, he has 
stopped being a note-taker. He believes the industrial program he is now a part of focuses on risk avoidance and not risk management, and he is committed to 
conforming to the industrial program security rules.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline K (Security Violations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline K by demonstrating that Applicant committed deliberate and negligent security 
violations while on active duty and after retirement.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> For nearly two years, he deliberately and without authorization took classified notes at briefings he 
attended, and retained them for his personal use.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He neither destroyed the notes nor entered them into an accountability system as required by government 
regulations. He did not properly secure the notes, but kept them with him, including when he traveled overseas.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He deliberately took some documents into retirement with him, including one taken for pride-of-authorship reasons, and took others into retirement with him 
inadvertently. But on two different occasions in October 1998, he deliberately destroyed documents he had inadvertently retained, precluding the government 
from performing a damage assessment on the information, or confirming his testimony that he believed some of the information might have been declassified. 
Nor did he disclose that he had improperly retained the information. None of this information came to light until Applicant was confronted with a polygraph 
examination.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Most of the mitigating conditions are inapplicable to Applicant. The most serious security violations were deliberate; only the less serious were inadvertent.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
The most serious security violations were frequent and repetitive, a continuing course of conduct.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Applicant had been properly and regularly trained on the 
security requirements of his positions.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The only potentially applicable mitigating condition concerns his attitude toward his security responsibilities since his 
violations were uncovered,<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> but this mitigating condition helps Applicant but little as his demonstrated attitude towards his security responsibilities before his 
violations were uncovered appear no different, yet they were markedly different in reality. Even if I concluded that Applicant would not deliberately violate 
security regulations in the future, based on his past conduct I have little confidence he would promptly disclose any inadvertent violation he committed. This is 
especially important in the industrial program where government supervision is less prevalent. I resolve Guideline K against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case by demonstrating Applicant's questionable judgment in executing his security responsibilities over an extended 
period of time.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> He appears to have initially misled his polygrapher in September 1999.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> He certainly violated security regulations over at least a two-year 
period.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions under personal conduct. His conduct was substantiated and pertinent to a judgment determination.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> While 
his misleading statements during the first polygraph may have been isolated and not recent, the circumstances of the polygraph undercut Applicant's claim of 
voluntary disclosure,<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> although he did cooperate with the investigation once the security violations were disclosed. He did not disclose the security violations 
until he was confronted with the adverse polygraph results.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Nor did Applicant receive bad advice about what he should reveal during the polygraph.<A HREF="02-16379.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> I resolve 
Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I believe Applicant a patriotic, loyal American, and his expressions of remorse genuine to a point. But his patriotism is not at issue in this hearing and his 
remorse misapprehends part of the security concern that remains. I have considered that Applicant's security violations were not committed for ulterior motives 
or personal gain and did not result in any apparent compromise of the information. Yet for two years the potential risk was a near-constant presence and the 
potential damage to national security, if the highly classified information was compromised, was great. I have also considered that clearance determinations are 
not intended to be punishments or rewards for an Applicant's conduct. However, the industrial security program puts a premium on individual's who are willing 
to put themselves on report should an inadvertent security violation occur, and Applicant has demonstrated himself to be singularly unwilling to do that until 
confronted with a polygraph. Under the circumstances of this case, I consider it inappropriate to continue Applicant's access to classified information.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Previously, Applicant had kept classified notes in secured spaces and had a separate notebook for his personal notes. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>And when he switched, he purged his old notebook of classified information and destroyed it. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>In those days, Applicant used a 3 x 5 flip notebook typically used by division officers. Applicant has given varying explanations about how it came to be in 
his possession. In his May 2000 sworn statement, he states that the notebook was full, probably kept in his workspace, and thus inadvertently brought home 
with his retirement boxes. At hearing, he testified that the notebook was substantially empty, kept for that reason, and inadvertently taken home when he retired 
(Tr. 165). 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Applicant asserted he panicked when he say the top secret document and took the first action that occurred to him (Tr. 121, 184). 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>Applicant asserted that the older documents were inadvertently taken with him when he retired, which begs the question how the classified documents came 
to be in his possession and retained in his personal papers all those years. At least one of the recent documents, a critique of the programs at his last job, he 
retained because of pride of ownership and his feeling that it might be over-classified at the secret level. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>In the first instance, Applicant was participating in a war game when he concluded that a line subordinate had a need to know the classified information he 
was not cleared for in order to successfully complete the mission. However, he disclosed the information to the subordinate, reported that disclosure to his 
superiors after the exercise, and ensured that the subordinate obtained the necessary clearances for that category of information in the future. The end result was 
no disciplinary action or other consequence to Applicant (AE E). In the latter instance, Applicant made the judgment call that "mission accomplishment" 
justified his keeping the classified information overnight (and unsecured) because he needed to get some sleep before an early start to attend meetings requiring 
the classified information. Again, Applicant suffered no adverse consequences, and subsequently passed follow-on polygraphs.
