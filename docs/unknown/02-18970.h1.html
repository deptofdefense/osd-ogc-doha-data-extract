<P>Although Applicant may have satisfied three of the six delinquent debts addressed in the SOR, he has not resolved all of them.  Moreover, he has not paid those 
until after two previous SORs were issued to him.  Applicant has had more than ample time to resolve these debts.  His failure to have done so by this time, 
coupled with his unwillingness to act until an SOR is issued, demonstrate that the Government's concern has not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 29, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-18970.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-18970.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR states that DOHA 
was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and recommends that his case be submitted 
to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, dated August 26, 2003, in which he requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 18, 2003.  A 
notice of hearing was issued on November 24, 2003 and the hearing was held on December 18, 2003.  During the hearing, 10 Government exhibits (Govt Ex), 
eight Applicant exhibits (Ap Ex) and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses, including Applicant, were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on 
January 2, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel did not provide Govt Ex 7 and Govt Ex 8 to Applicant until December 16, 2003.  They did not provide Govt Ex 10 to him until December 
17, 2003.  Therefore, I granted Applicant until January 9, 2004 to respond to these exhibits.  Applicant did not submit any additional information.  As requested 
by Department Counsel, he only submitted an additional copy of Ap Ex E that did not include his comments.  </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is employed by a defense contractor.  He is seeking a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In November 1995, Applicant opened a credit card account with a bank.  He incurred a balance on the account in the amount of $62.00.  By March 1997, the 
bank charged it off as a bad debt.  Applicant has not paid the debt (SOR &para; 1.a). </P> 
 
<P>In December 1995, Applicant opened a credit card account with a second bank.  He incurred a balance on the account in the amount of $64.00.  By February 
1997, the bank charged it off as a bad debt.  On August 1, 2001, Applicant paid off the debt (SOR &para; 1.e). </P> 
 
<P>In December 1995, Applicant opened an account with an electronics store.  He incurred a balance on the account in the amount of $3,629.00.  By July 2002, the 
store charged it off as a bad debt and turned it over to a collection agent.  By June 2003, Applicant paid the balance on the account to the collection agent (SOR 
&para; 1.b).</P> 
 
<P>In March 1997, Applicant opened an account with a wireless phone company.  He incurred an unpaid balance on the account in the amount of $124.00.  By 
arch 2003, the company charged it off as a bad debt.  Applicant has not paid the debt (SOR &para; 1.d). </P> 
 
<P>In July 1998, Applicant obtained an unsecured loan from a loan company.  He incurred an unpaid balance on the loan in the amount of $1,635.00.  By August 
2001, the company charged it off as a bad debt.  Applicant has not paid the debt (SOR &para; 1.f). </P> 
 
<P>In April 1999, Applicant opened an account with an automobile finance company.  He incurred an unpaid balance on the account in the amount of $413.00.  By 
February 2001, the company charged it off the as a bad debt.  By March 2002, Applicant paid the debt  (SOR &para; 1.c).</P> 
 
<P>On August 3, 2001, Applicant provided a sworn statement to an agent for the Defense Investigative Service (DIS).  He stated that he had wired a $64.00 
payment for the debt referred to in SOR &para; 1.e.  He further stated he would obtain letters from the creditors referred to in SOR &para; 1.a and d that would confirm 
they have no records of those debts.  Applicant stated he would then forward the letters to credit reporting services in order to remove the debts from his credit 
record.</P> 
 
<P>On December 16, 1999, the Department of the Army issued an SOR to Applicant that included three of the same delinquent debts addressed by DOHA in this 
case in the SOR &para; 1.a, d, and e.</P> 
 
<P>On March 15, 2002, the Department of the Army issued an SOR to Applicant that included three of the same delinquent debts addressed by DOHA in this case 
in the SOR &para; 1.a, c, d, and f.</P> 
 
<P>On March 15, 2002, the Army notified Applicant that it had made a preliminary decision to revoke his access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), in 
part, because of financial considerations.  Those financial considerations included same the debts referred to in this case, with the exception of SOR &para; 1.e.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's current annual income from a defense contractor is approximately $93,000.00.  He also receives approximately $27,000.00 in annual military 
retirement pay.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</P> 
 
<P>The concern is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Conditions that could  raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying include E2.A6.1.2.1, a history of not meeting financial obligations (Disqualifying Condition 1).  They also include 
E2.A6.1.2.3, inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A6.1.3.6, the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts (Mitigating Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Guideline F</P> 
 
<P>The evidence in the record of Applicant's delinquent indebtedness substantiates SOR &para; 1.a through SOR &para; 1.f.  It demonstrates Applicant's history of not 
meeting financial obligations, as well as his inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (Disqualifying Condition 1 and Disqualifying Condition 3).</P> 
 
<P>Debts addressed by the SOR that Applicant has provided evidence of having satisfied are his debt to the electronics store (SOR &para; 1.b) and his debt to the 
automobile finance company (SOR &para; 1.c).  Applicant's payment of a third debt (SOR &para; 1.e) is also established by the record.<A HREF="02-18970.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Although this is evidence of 
itigating Condition 6 with respect to these debts, Applicant did not satisfy any of these debts until after they became delinquent.  He did not pay his obligation 
to the electronics store until after his debt had become delinquent and the creditor assigned it to a collection agent.  Applicant did not pay off a small debt to a 
bank until more than four years after the bank charged it off as a bad debt.  In the case of the debt to the automobile finance company, his title reflects a release 
of lien by the creditor but not until March 2, 2002.  Based on the payments required by his purchase contract, he was arrear in payment for at least more than a 
year before he satisfied the obligation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has submitted evidence of having written to all three credit reporting agencies to challenge their listing of the remaining debts addressed by SOR.  
However, he has not provided corroboration of his testimony of having satisfied them.  In the case of the largest of the debts, $1635.00 (SOR &para; 1.f), Applicant 
submitted a letter from a different creditor that he is current on the account.  Although it may have been an inadvertent mistake on his part, Applicant's own 
exhibit (E) establishes that this a different account from the one addressed by SOR &para; 1.f. </P> 
 
<P>Moreover, Applicant was confronted with some of the same debts addressed in the SOR in  this case in previous SORs.  The SOR issued to him on March 15, 
2002 addressed four of the same delinquent debts listed in the current SOR.  Three of them were included in the SOR issued to him on December 16, 1999, 
more than three and a half years before DOHA issued the SOR in this case.  The previous SORs demonstrate a pattern of the Applicant not addressing his 
delinquent debts until an SOR is issued to him.  They also establish that he has had more than ample time in which to resolve the debts addressed in his current 
SOR. </P> 
 
<P>In making my assessment in accordance with E2.2.1, I have also considered the fact that his credit reports and other evidence of record reflect Applicant has 
incurred other delinquent debts that he has never satisfied.  The record reflects that Applicant has not resolved a default judgment that was entered against him 
in 1998 for unpaid rent in the amount of $355.24.  Although his federal tax refund check for 2003 indicates that it has been satisfied, the record also evidences a 
federal tax lien in the amount of $4,552.00 was filed against Applicant in 2000.</P> 
 
<P>As Applicant contends, his income may make him able to pay his debts.  However, Applicant's failure to have resolved all of the delinquent debts addressed by 
the SOR by this time, coupled with his unwillingness to act until an SOR is issued, demonstrate that the Government's concern has not been mitigated.  I find 
against Applicant. </P>
