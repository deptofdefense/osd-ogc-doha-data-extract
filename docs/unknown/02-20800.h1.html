<P>Although her family ties to Taiwan raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated the concern because of the totality of the circumstances show 
her family ties do not pose an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence.  Additionally, Applicant has worked in the defense industry since 1982 and 
held a security clearance in excess of 20 years without incident.  Applicant also successfully mitigated a security concern about her inadvertent omission of 
certain family members on her security clearance application.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 24, 2003, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-20800.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 21, 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me on January 7, 2004.  On January 20, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented eight exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, without objection.  Applicant presented 
two exhibits, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on January 30, 
2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 51-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  She was born and raised in the Republic of China (Taiwan).  She attended a university in 
Taiwan from September 1973 to June 1977 and was awarded a bachelor of arts degree.  In May 1977, she married her husband in Taiwan and they immigrated 
to the United States in September 1977.  Applicant attended two universities after arriving in the United States, the first from September 1979 to June 1980, and 
the second from September 1980 to May 1982.  She was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer science from the second university.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband have three sons all born in the United States, ages 26, 22, and 17.  Her first son has graduated from college, her second son is in 
college, and her third son is in high school.  All three sons are resident citizens in the United States.  Applicant became a naturalized citizen in May 1983 and 
her husband became a naturalized citizen in April 1982.  Applicant has worked in the defense industry since 1982 and has held a secret clearance in excess of 
20 years.  Applicant's husband is employed as an engineer. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are resident citizens of Taiwan.  In 1948, they emigrated from the Peoples Republic of China (China) to Taiwan after the Communist 
takeover and still live there.  Her father is 85 years old and her mother is 80 years old. Her father retired from the Taiwanese military as an officer and receives a 
pension from the Taiwanese government for his military service.  He has no contact with the Taiwanese government.  He currently is employed part-time as a 
manager for a taxi company.  Applicant's mother has been a housewife her entire life.  Applicant visits her parents annually and communicates with them by 
telephone approximately two times per month.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has one brother, who is a resident citizen of China and is not employed.  Her brother remained in China when the family immigrated to Taiwan 
before she was born.  Since her parents left China, she has only seen him once in December 1994 on a visit to see her parents in Taiwan.  During that visit, her 
father requested her to see her brother and she agreed.  Applicant and her parents traveled from Taiwan to Hong Kong, where a five-day visit took place 
between Applicant, her brother, and her parents.  Since then, she has not seen him nor has she communicated with him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has two sisters, who are resident citizens of Taiwan.  One sister holds a United States green card, but is with her husband in Taiwan, who is employed 
by a United States company.  Neither sister nor her brothers-in law are employed by the Taiwanese government</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are from Taiwan and are naturalized citizen residents of the United States.  Applicant's husband is one of seven 
children, all of whom were born in Taiwan.  Of those seven siblings, five are naturalized resident citizens of the United States, including Applicant's husband, 
one sibling is a non-citizen resident of the United States, who holds a green card, and one sibling is a citizen resident of Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was cited in her SOR for falsifying her security clearance application, dated November 30, 1999, for failing to list her brother, who is a resident 
citizen of China, her two sisters, who are resident citizens of Taiwan, and extended family members who are resident citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant responded 
in her Answer to the SOR and testified at hearing that her failure to list the above family members was an unintentional omission.  Applicant had provided this 
information on two previous security clearance applications, dated September 30, 1983 and March 21, 1990.  GE 2 and GE 3.  She further disclosed these 
family members and their status to the Defense Security Service in two signed, sworn statements dated December 5, 1983 and December 4, 2001.  GE 4 and GE 
5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband own a home and rental property in the United States.  She is registered to vote, maintains bank accounts in the United States, and 
exercises all rights of citizenship.  Applicant expressed great affection and loyalty for the United States.  She has a demonstrated history of being a trusted and 
valued employee with no security breaches during the 20 plus years she has held a security clearance.    </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's parents, sisters, and extended family members are resident citizens of Taiwan; (&para; 1.a); that Applicant's brother is a 
resident citizen of China (&para; 1.b); and that Applicant travels annually to Taiwan to visit her parents (&para; 1.c).  A security risk may exist when an Applicant's 
immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to 
duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR-Applicant has immediate family members 
who are citizen residents of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  While the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb 8, 2001).  It is a mitigating condition if the immediate family members or associates 
are not agents of a foreign power  and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to his family members and loyalty to the United States.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science.  Instead, they are predictive judgments about an Applicant's security suitability in light of that person's 
past conduct and <EM>present circumstances.  Egan, </EM>484 U.S. at 528-29.  Applicant is a loyal United States citizen, and has strong ties of affection or obligation to 
her family members, in particular her aging parents, who are resident citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant's primary purpose in traveling to Taiwan has been to visit 
her aging parents and to check on their well being. None of Applicant's relatives are agents of a foreign power.  Although Applicant's father retired from the 
Taiwanese military as an officer and receives a pension, he has no contact with Taiwanese government officials and is employed in the private sector as a part-time manager of a taxi company. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has only seen her brother, who is a resident citizen of China, one time and that was ten years ago in 1994 in Hong Kong at the request of her father.  
Since that visit, Applicant has not seen her brother nor does she maintain contact with him.  Applicant has three children born in the United States.  She and her 
husband are naturalized United States citizen.  Most significantly and persuasively, Appellant has worked in the defense industry since 1982 and has held a 
security clearance for over 20 years without incident.  She has a proven track record of loyalty and trust to her employer and the United States.  Under the 
totality of circumstances, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on her security clearance application dated November 30, 1999 by failing to list her brother, sisters 
and extended family members (&para; 2.a).  A security risk may exist by the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant could reasonably have been expected to be more diligent about ensuring her security clearance application was complete with regard to her 
family members, her judgment lapses are not enough to impute knowing and willful falsification under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant previously listed all of the omitted family members on two previous security clearance applications submitted in September 1983 and March 1990.  
She also discussed her family members in written statements previously submitted in December 1983 and December 2001.  Applicant's explanations of her 
omissions due to oversight, her previous submission of this information, and credible testimony in this regard are persuasive enough to avert inferences of 
knowing and wilful omission.  There being no misconduct substantiated, no need to show extenuation or mitigation arises.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-13568 
(February 13, 2004.).</SPAN></P>
