<P>The recency of applicant's dishonest and criminal conduct precludes a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to 
classified information. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 31,  2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 27, 2002. The case was assigned to the undersigned on July 15, 2002, and a Notice of Hearing was 
issued on August 7, 2002. The hearing was held on September 10, 2002. The transcript was received on September 18, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 44 year old security officer.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR Allegation 1.a:</SPAN> Applicant completed and executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) on January 5, 1999. Among the questions applicant was 
required to answer were questions 21 and 24, which appeared on the SCA as follows:</P> 
<P><STRONG>21. Your Police Record - Felony Offenses</STRONG></P> 
<P>Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.) For this item, report 
information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is 
for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 
18 U.S.C. 3607.</P> 
<P><STRONG>24. Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses</STRONG></P> 
<P>Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in 
your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal 
Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded "no" to both questions. These responses were false because she had been charged with a drug-related felony (Possession of a Controlled 
Substance - Cocaine) in 1990 (Exhibit 4).<A HREF="01-08565.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has given different explanations for her "no" responses. In a signed, sworn statement that she gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in May 
2000 (Exhibit 2), she stated: "I did not intentionally falsify my (SCA) because I did not realize the question on the (SCA) specified that I had to disclose this 
arrest even though it had been dismissed. I did not believe the question pertaining to drug related arrests applied to me because the crack cocaine was not mine 
and the charge had been dismissed." In her response to the SOR she stated: "It was wrong for me to falsify material facts on my (SCA). In doing so I caused and 
created the appearance of an unethical reputation. It was not intended as a lie because I did not realize that I had a record. The Public Defender said I would not 
have a record if I agreed not to go to trial. Therefore, I did not believe I had a police record for nine years . . . There is no excuse for falsifying facts. I should 
have answered truthfully about the arrest and explained the charges against me." At the hearing, applicant, for the first time, stated that she responded "no" to 
the two questions because she thought the "single exception" referenced in both questions applied to her (TR at 21-22; 40-42; 75-76). When asked why she had 
not mentioned this "single exception" as the reason for her "no" responses when she responded to the SOR, applicant replied, "There's no particular reason why 
I didn't mention it" (TR at 89-90).</P> 
<P>Based on the evidence presented, I find that applicant intentionally provided false, material information to the Government when she responded "no" to 
questions 21 and 24.<A HREF="01-08565.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> At the time she completed the SCA, she knew she had been charged with a drug-related felony. With this knowledge, a person of 
applicant's intelligence would have no difficulty understanding that "yes" was the proper response to questions 21 and 24. As to her explanation that she 
thought the "single exception" justified her "no" responses, this explanation was not credible. The fact that she did not mention this until the hearing seriously 
undercuts the credibility of this explanation, as does the fact that the "single exception" refers to the expungement of a conviction, and she knew at the time she 
completed the SCA that she had not been convicted of the charge.</P> 
<P>   </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR Allegation 1.b:</SPAN> The circumstances regarding applicant's 1990 arrest are in dispute. Applicant maintains that the crack cocaine the police found on the 
ground near where she was standing was not hers and was there before she ever arrived at the scene (Exhibit 2; TR at 54-57). The police maintain that applicant 
dropped the crack cocaine on the ground after she was asked to exit her vehicle (Exhibit 5). As noted above, although applicant was charged with Possession of 
a Controlled Substance (Cocaine) as a result of this incident, the charge was eventually dismissed. Viewing the evidence as a whole, I cannot find that applicant 
intentionally provided false information when she provided her version of events in her May 4, 2000 signed, sworn statement (Exhibit 2). Accordingly, this 
allegation is found for applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR Allegation 1.c:</SPAN> The evidence does not support a finding that applicant used marijuana.<A HREF="01-08565.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Accordingly, this allegation is found for applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors) which must be followed by the Administrative 
Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are applicable:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Factors</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. E2.A5.1.2.2: The deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire.  </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Factors</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Factors</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.2.2: A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Factors</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.3.2: The crime was an isolated incident.<A HREF="01-08565.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>The evidence establishes that in 1990, applicant was charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance, a drug-related felony. The evidence further establishes 
that applicant intentionally concealed this incident from the Government when she responded "no" to questions 21 and 24 on the SCA she executed in January 
1999. Given the isolated nature of the drug-related incident, and the passage of time since it occurred, had applicant disclosed it on the SCA, it  most likely 
would  not have adversely affected her security clearance request. However, applicant's omission of this incident from the SCA in 1999 raises new security 
concerns, separate and apart from the underlying incident.</P> 
<P>The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness required of clearance holders. In this case, the recency of applicant's dishonesty, together with her continuing inability or unwillingness to 
acknowledge it, precludes a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.</P>
