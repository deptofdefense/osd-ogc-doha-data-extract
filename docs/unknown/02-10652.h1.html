</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 23, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-10652.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-10652.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26, 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2003.  On October 8, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government submitted six exhibits, which were marked 
1 through 6 and admitted into evidence.  Applicant submitted six exhibits, which were marked A through F and admitted into evidence.  At the end of the 
hearing, I granted a request by Department Counsel, which was concurred in by Applicant, that the record remain open so that Applicant could submit 
additional evidence.  Accordingly, the record was held open until November 3, 2003 and Applicant submitted 11 additional documents, admitted without 
objection as Applicant's Exhibits G through Q.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on October 16, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains 13 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  Applicant admitted six allegations and denied six 
allegations.  She neither admitted nor denied one allegation.  Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time of her hearing, Applicant was 27 years old and unmarried.  She was employed by a government contractor as a network engineer.  She lost her 
security clearance when her employer learned of the SOR and her financial problems.  Applicant remained with the employer as a consultant assigned to a 
lower-paying position which did not require a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been self-supporting and on her own since adolescence.  She moved in with her grandmother when she was 16 and lived with the grandmother 
during her senior year in high school.  After high school, she acquired her own apartment and began supporting herself.  Applicant worked full-time and took 
out student loans to finance her education.  At the time of her hearing, Applicant's student loan debt totaled approximately $21,000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant moved often in pursuit of work and did not regularly provide forwarding addresses.  In her late teens and early twenties, she acquired debts at her 
several residences and work locations and her creditors were unable to find her.  Applicant acquired several debts for health care services, state taxes, car 
rentals, and utilities.  Her credit report also showed a judgment for back rent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In approximately late 1996 or early 1997, Applicant purchased a used car on credit.  Within a month the car broke down on a major highway.  Applicant left the 
car by the side of the road with the keys inside.  She called the company that had financed her purchase of the car and said she no longer wanted the car.  She 
told the finance company where she had left the car and requested that the company send someone to pick up the car and repossess it.  The finance company 
claimed the car was not where Applicant said she had left it.  Neither Applicant nor the company was able to locate the car.  Applicant filed a police report, but 
did not retain a copy.  She did not have the bill of sale or the vehicle's registration number.  The vehicle was not found.  Applicant's Exhibit B is a warrant in 
debt summoning her to appear in court on November 19, 2003, to answer the creditor's claim against her for the default balance due on her auto loan.  The 
amount of the claim was over $8,000 in principal, with interest at 22 percent from September 18, 1998, until paid, $65 in costs, and approximately $1,620 in 
attorney's fees.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2003, Applicant sought help from a credit relief service that contacted her creditors, arranged repayment or settlement plans, and worked with the 
credit organizations to delete from her record any debts that had been paid or settled.  In her post-hearing filing, Applicant supplied records to show she had 
paid $50 per month for the credit relief service.  Her post-hearing filing showed she had drawn approximately $630 from her pension plan/savings account<A HREF="02-10652.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to 
pay in part three debts identified in the SOR.  She also presented persuasive evidence to show she had paid a debt for overpayment of unemployment benefits to 
State A.  Applicant presented a letter from an attorney for the judgment creditor memorializing her commitment to pay off the judgment in full by December 1, 
2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may  try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, 
and her financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. 
and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate 
the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 
2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent accounts placed in collection (&para;&para; 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h.,1.l. and 1.k.); accounts charged off as 
bad debts (&para;&para; 1.i. and 1.j.); an unpaid civil judgment (&para; 1.a.), and a monthly surplus of income which was not used to extinguish debts identified in the SOR 
(&para;1.m.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided persuasive evidence to show that the debt alleged at SOR &para; 1.i. had been satisfied in full in June 2002.  She also provided evidence that the 
debt alleged at SOR &para; 1.f. had been settled for $102.75 and that, on October 28, 2003, a partial payment of $300 had been made on the debt alleged at &para;1.c.  
Additionally, she demonstrated at the time of her hearing she did not have a net monthly surplus of $1018, as alleged at &para;1.m.  She presented a letter of 
agreement from the counsel for a creditor identified at 1.a. of the SOR memorializing her promise to make full payment of the debt by December 1. 2003.  She 
provided evidence that the creditor holding the debt alleged at &para; 1.g. had agreed to a payment plan and she indicated she had made a payment of $300, leaving a 
balance due of $383.80.  She was unable to show the debts alleged at &para;&para; 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.j., and 1.l. had been paid or otherwise resolved.  She denied the debt 
alleged at SOR&para; 1.h. but was unable to explain why the debt was not hers.  She also admitted the debt of approximately $8,000 alleged at SOR &para; 1.k. but failed 
to provide a credible explanation for why the debt should not be her responsibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through its Exhibits and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  While 
Applicant provided some persuasive evidence to show that she had retired or settled certain debts, she provided no persuasive evidence to rebut other financial 
concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts, some of which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  While Applicant lost a position requiring a security clearance and took a lower-paying job, it would appear that her financial 
difficulties arose before she lost her job and experience a reduction in salary and were not beyond her control.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not 
apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the past, Applicant has expressed intentions to pay her delinquent debts.  To her credit, Applicant has recently sought to bring her financial problems under 
control.  She has tapped her savings to pay debts and she has sought help from a credit counseling organization to pay some of her long-standing delinquencies.  
Thus, mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.4. and E2.A6.1.3.6. apply in part to the facts of her case.  However, Applicant appears to lack a plan for mitigating the 
large debt alleged at &para; 1.k. of the SOR, as well as several lesser debts, thus continuing her financial over extension and creating a security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, Applicant has mitigated the allegations at &para;&para; 1.f., 1.i., and 1.m. of the SOR, and the finding is therefore for her as to those allegations.  The 
allegations at &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j.,1.k., and 1.l. are, however, concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board states that an administrative judge, in deciding an applicant's security worthiness, 
"must consider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa."  </EM>I 
have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive, and I conclude that Applicant 
has not successfully overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
