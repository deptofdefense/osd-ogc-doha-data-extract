<P>Applicant's use of cocaine seven times between January and February 2002 was mitigated by the isolated nature of the conduct, the passage of time without 
recurrence of the conduct, Applicant's seeking counseling to address the reasons he tried cocaine, and Applicant's demonstrated intent to be drug-free in the 
future. The record did not support allegations that Applicant falsified his March 2003 clearance application. Clearance granted.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 18 May 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of illegal drug use<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>. He answered the SOR 5 June 2005, and requested a decision without hearing. He did not respond to DOHA's 27 
October 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 9 December 2005, when his response was due. DOHA assigned the case to me 22 
December 2005.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the drug allegations of the SOR, but denied falsifying his clearance application; accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 42-year-old structural assembler employed by a defense contractor since February 2003--seeks access to classified information. He has not 
previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between January 2002 and February 2002, Applicant used cocaine approximately seven times with acquaintances in social settings. At the time, he was 
experiencing marital problems and his friends--who were using cocaine--suggested that cocaine might take his mind off his problems. All his cocaine use 
occurred at a friend's house, and he usually "chipped in" for the cost. In February 2002, he tested positive for cocaine use on a random drug screen by his 
employer, an overnight delivery company, and was fired. Applicant realized his cocaine use had been a big mistake and he resolved to never become involved 
with illegal drugs again. Applicant and his wife participated in several group marital counseling sessions at their church, and got private marital counseling 
from a psychiatrist on six or seven occasions between February and March 2002. He reports that they have a much better relationship after the counseling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his clearance application in March 2003, he reported using cocaine seven times between January 2001 and February 2001 (question 
27). He also reported being fired from a job with an overnight delivery company in March 1999 because of a positive drug screen (question 20).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) in June 2004, he was asked to review his clearance application and confirm the 
accuracy of the entries. Applicant noted a typographical error in the reported dates of his drug use, and gave the agent the correct January-February 2002 dates. 
He also noted that the March 1999 firing date was incorrect (being instead the date he transferred from one company office to another, and provided the agent 
the correct February 2002 date.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline H, but the Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant used cocaine seven times between 
January and February 2002, contributed to the purchase of the cocaine on a few occasions, and was fired for a cocaine-positive drug screen in February 2002.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
However, Applicant's conduct since he was fired mitigates the security concerns. Although his cocaine use must be seen as recent,<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> it was isolated and 
aberrational.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He had no illegal drug use before January 2002 and none after February 2002. More pertinent to the security concerns, he realized what a mistake 
his cocaine use was and resolved to avoid illegal drugs, a decision he made more than a year before obtaining work with a federal contractor and applying for a 
security clearance. Further, Applicant and his wife sought marital counseling for the issues that were troubling their marriage--and that lead Applicant to try 
illegal drugs for the first time in his life--and resolved those issues through counseling. This counseling, coupled with Applicant's remaining drug-free since 
February 2002, demonstrates his intent to abstain from illegal drugs in the future.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> On this record, it is extremely unlikely that Applicant would return to illegal 
drug use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government failed to establish a Guideline E case. Applicant truthfully reported the details of the only two pieces of derogatory information in his 
background investigation: his cocaine use and his being fired from a job for a positive drug test. He reported these events under dates that were themselves 
relevant and material to a clearance determination. Neither the cocaine use nor the job dismissal are made inherently more relevant and material by Applicant's 
correcting those dates to February 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, even if I concluded that there was a relevant and material difference between the dates Applicant reported on his clearance application and the 
corrected dates he gave during his subject interview, the record clearly indicates Applicant intended no deception.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He could gain nothing by a falsification, and 
the government could not have been mislead about the nature and extent of Applicant's drug use, even if it had never learned the correct dates. Applicant's 
explanations for the discrepancies in dates are more than plausible. In one instance, his explanation is corroborated by his employment record that shows a job 
relocation with the same employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, even if I concluded (which I do not) that Applicant deliberately gave false dates on his clearance application, I would still conclude he mitigated the 
security concerns. The putative misrepresented information was not relevant to a clearance decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the putative misrepresentations were recent in 
the context of his clearance application, they were isolated, and the only available evidence (his sworn statement) demonstrates he provided the correct 
information voluntarily<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and did so before being confronted with any discrepancies.<A HREF="04-09073.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The only substantive evidence the government produced to support its 
case was generated by Applicant, comprising Applicant's March 2003 clearance application and his June 2004 sworn statement to the DSS. The dates the 
government alleges as the "true" dates were given by Applicant in his sworn statement, who contemporaneously corrected the "typos" in his clearance 
application. All the evidence suggests Applicant volunteered the information while reviewing his clearance application. The government produced no evidence 
suggesting it had independent information with which to confront Applicant about the dates he gave on his clearance application. I conclude Guideline E for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>
