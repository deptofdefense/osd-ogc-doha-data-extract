<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><FONT FACE="Times">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">On August 6, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to                     (Applicant), which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 30, 1996. The case was received by the undersigned on October 7, 1996, and a Notice of Hearing
was issued on October 11, 1996. A hearing was held on November 5, 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Applicant is a thirty-four year old married man.<FONT FACE="Times"></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1a</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant is currently indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of $6,300.00. He has not made any payment to the creditor since October 1991. 
When asked why he hadn't made any payment since October 1991, applicant replied, "no money" (TR at 102).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that he intends to satisfy this debt when he has the funds to do so. He offered evidence establishing that in August 1996, after he received
the SOR, he contacted the creditor and reached an agreement to settle the debt for $4,500.00. However, since the agreement required applicant to make the
full payment by September 30, 1996 (Exhibit J), and he failed to do so, applicant is still indebted in the original amount, i.e., approximately $6,300.00.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1b</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant received a car loan from this creditor in approximately 1990. In approximately April 1993, he voluntarily returned the car to the creditor because
he could no longer afford the payments. The creditor subsequently notified applicant that he still owed approximately $3,000.00 on the car loan. Applicant
does not believe he owes the creditor $3,000.00. According to applicant's testimony, at the time he returned the car he owed approximately $7,626.00 to the
creditor, and since the creditor sold the car for $6,500.00, he should only be liable for the approximately $1,100.00 difference. Applicant does not believe
he should be held liable for other charges associated with the return and subsequent sale of the car. For this reason, he does not intend to pay this creditor
the amount they are demanding. He will, however, pay them the approximately $1,100.00 he admits he owes when he has the funds to do so. He has not
made any payments to this creditor since he returned the car.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1c</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant is currently indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of $4,300.00. He has not made any payment to this creditor since October 1992
(Exhibit O). He intends to satisfy the debt, but at the present time does not have the funds to do so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In August 1996, after he received the SOR, applicant contacted the creditor. He was able  to get the creditor to agree to accept $3,000.00 to settle the debt as
long as applicant's payment was received by September 30, 1993 (Exhibit I). Since applicant did not make the agreed-upon payment, he is still indebted in
the original amount, i.e., approximately $4,300.00.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1d</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant was indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of $585.00 for telephone services provided to him in 1994. In August 1996 the creditor
accepted a $352.00 payment from applicant to settle the debt (Exhibit A).</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1e</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of $440.00 for telephone services provided to him in 1994. Although he has not made any
payments to this creditor since 1994, he was in contact with this creditor "days ago" in an effort "to clarify" what he owes (TR at 85, 116). He intends to
satisfy this debt when he can afford it.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">SOR Allegation 1f</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant admits that he was indebted to this creditor, but not in the amount claimed. Applicant states that he owes this creditor just two or three days rent,
not an entire month's rent as the creditor claims. Applicant was able to persuade the creditor to drop some of the charges, and in September 1996, he settled
the debt for $231.64 (Exhibits B and Q).</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant's Testimony</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that while he was employed as an engineer from 1988 to June 1991, he was current on his debt payments. However, after he was laid off
in June 1991, he incurred additional debts and fell behind on some of his debt payments. His financial condition remained poor for several years thereafter
as he and his wife went through periods of unemployment and underemployment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant further testified that to date he has done what he can do to satisfy his past-due financial obligations, as evidenced by the fact he has satisfied some
of the smaller debts. With respect to the remaining past-due financial obligations, applicant testified that he "accrued them over five years and it's going to
take some time" to satisfy them. He further testified, however, that he has a plan to satisfy them which, in essence, consists of applicant saving $200.00 per
month and borrowing money from his 401K plan until he has sufficient funds to satisfy the debts. Applicant further testified that he feels responsible for the
debts and will pay them off.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">POLICIES</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth the Adjudication Policy (divided into Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors) which must be followed by the
Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are applicable:</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</U></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Disqualifying Factors:</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Mitigating Factors:</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e. g., loss of employment).</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The evidence establishes that applicant has been indebted to (1) -------- for two separate credit card accounts in the approximate amount of $10,500.00 since at
least 1992, (2) ----------------------- for a car loan in the approximate amount of $3,000.00 since at least 1993, and (3) ------------------------------ for telephone
services in the approximate amount of $440.00 since 1994. The evidence further establishes that, although applicant testified he intends to satisfy these debts, he
has  not made <STRONG>any</STRONG> payment to -------- since 1992,  <STRONG>any </STRONG>payment to --------------- since 1993, or  <STRONG>any</STRONG> payment to ------------------------- since 1994,</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
notwithstanding the fact that he and his wife have been fully employed the past eighteen months. These long-standing debts, and applicant's inability</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> or</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
unwillingness to make <STRONG>any</STRONG> payment on them, raise serious and substantial doubts about his suitability for access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">There is no doubt that applicant's financial difficulties were caused, in large part, by his several years of unemployment and underemployment. For this reason,
the fact that he fell behind on his debt payments is understandable, and had he taken real and substantial steps to resolve his debts after he and his wife were
hired by their current employer eighteen months ago, his financial difficulties might not now be a security concern. However, to date, applicant has not taken
any meaningful action to satisfy four of his long-standing debts, which represent the bulk of the indebtedness alleged in the SOR. The fact that he contacted -------- and reached a settlement with them is not very persuasive evidence that applicant is willing and able to effectively deal with his financial problems in view of
his inability or unwillingness to honor the terms of the settlement. And, the fact that he contacted the phone company "days ago" to clarify what he owes  is not
very persuasive evidence of financial responsibility given the fact applicant took no action to satisfy this relatively minor debt during the previous two years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that he has a plan to satisfy these debts. Regardless of applicant's sincerity, his plan does not constitute credible evidence that his financial
difficulties have been resolved, or are likely to be resolved.  There are simply too many variables involved to conclude with any certainty that applicant will able
to follow through with his plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Given applicant's inability or unwillingness to take any meaningful steps to satisfy the four long-standing debts referred to above, and the lack of any evidence
that reasonably suggests applicant's financial condition is likely to significantly improve anytime soon, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him access to classified information at this time. For this reason, Criterion F is found against applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">PARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">DECISION</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for applicant.</FONT></P>
