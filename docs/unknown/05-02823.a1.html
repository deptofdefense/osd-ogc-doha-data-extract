<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July 27, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On February 22, 2006, after considering the record, 
Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline E had 
not been mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under Guideline E had been mitigated, as a matter of 
law, because the disqualifying conduct was an isolated incident that was not recent, and the Applicant has since demonstrated remorse and rehabilitated.  In 
support of his argument, Applicant offers new evidence in the form of additional explanations about the circumstances surrounding his conduct.  The Board 
does not find Applicant's argument persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.  Therefore, we cannot consider Applicant's additional explanations about the 
circumstances surrounding his conduct.</P> 
 
<P>The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had fraudulently charged labor and falsified company documents on multiple 
occasions over a six-month period in 2002.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the 
disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably 
applying any mitigating conditions or whole person factors in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in 
mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance 
decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
