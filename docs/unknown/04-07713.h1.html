<P>Applicant's intentional falsification on his security clearance application is a violation of Title 18, USC 1001, a felony, and his other criminal conduct have not 
been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On May 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 15, 2005, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the 
undersigned on August 10, 2005.  The hearing in this matter was originally scheduled for September 28, 2005.  The Applicant submitted a motion for 
continuance based upon good cause and the matter was rescheduled.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 
5, 2005.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented fifteen exhibits.  He testified and called three witnesses to testify on 
his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on October 17, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the Applicant's testimony, his three witnesses and fifteen exhibits and the 
Government's six exhibits.  The Applicant is 35 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Information Technology Administrator and is seeking 
to obtain his security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed an electronic Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated December 11, 2002.  Question 26 of the application asked the 
Applicant if in the last seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.  The 
Applicant answered, "NO."  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested in September 1995, 
for Burglary among other charges and in November 2000, for Domestic Violence.  The Applicant explained that he misread or misunderstood the question 
when he answered it.  (Tr. p. 45).  The Applicant was also in a rush to get the paperwork done.  (Tr. p. 51).  With regard to Applicant's arrest in September 
1995, I find that it occurred so close in time to the seven year cut off that the Applicant could have reasonably left it off of the application.  His arrest for 
Domestic Violence in November 2000 is another matter.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was still on probation for the offense at the time he completed the security clearance 
application.  I find that the Applicant knew or should have known to reveal the truth about his arrest history.  The fact that he did not indicates that he was 
simply not being truthful at the time he completed the security clearance application.  He did not take the process of filing out the application seriously and it 
obviously shows.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant deliberately attempted to conceal this information from the Government on his security clearance 
application.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's deliberate falsifications on his security clearance application, discussed above, are a violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 
1001, a felony. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested as mentioned above in September 1995 for (1) Burglary, Enter a Residence, Room, or any Structure, (2) Using Access Card 
Obtained Without Consent of Cardholder or Issuer, and (3) Disobey Court Order, Written Terms or Out-of State Order Willfully.  The Applicant purchased 
clothing with a credit card he knew to be stolen.  The Applicant pled guilty to a lesser offense of Count 1, and was sentenced to 45 days confinement, 40 days 
suspended, was placed on three years probation, ordered to pay restitution and was fined $500.00.  Count 2 and 3 were dismissed.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 4 
and 5). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was arrested again in November 2000, and charged with (1) Domestic Violence, Inflicting Injury on Currently or Former Spouse or Cohabitant, 
and (2) Resisting, Obstructing or Delaying a Peace Officer or EMT While in Discharge of their Duties.  The Applicant was under the influence of alcohol when 
he came home one evening.  He started to leave the house  and his wife stood in his path to try to stop him.  He picked her up, threw her around, pushed her, 
and choked her neck with his hands until she was able to bite his arm and run for help.  The Applicant pleaded guilty in March 2001 to a lesser offense of Count 
(1) and was granted three years of probation.  He was ordered to perform 20 days in a public work program, attend 52 sessions in a Domestic Violence 
Recovery Program and pay a total of $325.00 in fines.  Count 2 was dismissed.  The Applicant and his wife lived apart following this arrest for one year.  The 
Applicant was subsequently charged with failure to appear on or about April 13, 2001, July 3, 2001 and November 12, 2002.  The Applicant's fine was referred 
to collection on July 1, 2003.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 4 and 5).  The Applicant's Domestic Violence Treatment Program Reports show that he attended the 
counseling program in 2001 and 2002.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits D, E, F, G, H, I and J).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1992, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Illegal Discharging of a Firearm in a Negligent Manner, a felony, and (2) Firing of Certain 
Firearms and /or Fireworks within the City limits.  On New Years Eve, while under the influence of alcohol, the Applicant fired off his pistol at the stroke of 
midnight to celebrate.  He was forced to surrender the weapon.  The charges were dismissed.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 4 and 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's wife and two coworkers and friends testified that the Applicant is an intelligent and honest person who has rehabilitated himself.  He has no 
problem reading and writing. They know about his criminal past and do not find a problem with recommending him for a security clearance.  (Tr. pp.17- 42).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation from professional colleagues, coworkers and friends of the Applicant indicate that he is considered to be a person of high integrity, a 
diligent worker, responsible and ambitious.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits K, L, M, N and O). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Performance evaluations of the Applicant from 1990 to 1993, during the period he was in the military, show that he was a productive member of the Armed 
Forces and was recommended for retention.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits A, B and C).  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.        The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been untruthful on his security clearance application (Guideline E); in 
violation of a criminal statute (Guideline J).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because 
of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guidelines E and J, the Applicant has presented no reasonable excuse as to why he did not reveal his arrest for Domestic Violence in November 
2000, in response to question 26 on his security clearance application.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no reasonable excuse for 
his failure to answer the questions truthfully.  It is noted that the application was electronically transmitted however, that had nothing to do with why the 
Applicant did not reveal the information.  Furthermore, the Applicant was on probation for the November 2000 offense and had three failures to appear 
concerning the offense when he completed the security clearance application.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been completely 
honest with the Government regarding his criminal history and he sought to conceal the truth.  Disqualifying Condition<EM> (2) The deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities </EM>applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the 
Government and that he violated Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.  In addition, the Applicant's history of criminal conduct that includes 
three other arrests spread over a period of eight years, the most recent of which occurred in 2000 has not been mitigated.  Accordingly, I find against the 
Applicant under Guidelines E and J.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement 
of Reasons. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER>
