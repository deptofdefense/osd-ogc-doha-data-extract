<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns of foreign influence over his wife, stepson, and other relatives who are citizens of a foreign country.  Applicant had 
the courage to leave his country when it was under communist rule.  He got political asylum in the US where he has worked for the same company for twenty 
years.  He has been a US citizen since August 1987 and has strong personal and financial ties to the US which on balance reduce the security significance of his 
overseas investment in a family property and his modest overseas bank account.  As his relatives do not have ties to the foreign government, now a 
parliamentary democracy, and are not agents of a foreign power, it is unlikely that his family members could be coerced to pressure him to chose between 
loyalty to them and to the US.   Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government could not reach the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the Applicant,<A HREF="01-03017.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> so the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 20, 2001.  The 
SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign influence (Guideline B).  Applicant received the SOR and replied to these SOR allegations in a 
notarized Answer dated October 19, 2001, where he admitted  all allegations and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to Department Counsel.  On 
November 28, 2001, she attested it was Ready to Proceed; on that date the case was assigned to me.  </P> 
 
<P>Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was found.  A Notice of Hearing  issued on December 13, 2001, set the matter for January 17, 2002, at a 
location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the Government presented three exhibits which were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-3).   
Applicant testified himself and called one other witness; he offered twelve exhibits (Exhibits A through L) which were admitted into evidence.  The  transcript 
(TR) was received on January 28, 2002.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 50 years old, has been employed at his company<A HREF="01-03017.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (Company #1) for almost twenty years.  In June 1999 he was asked to obtain a security clearance 
and completed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) to seek a security clearance when 
another employee retired.  As the chief engineer he is responsible for technical developments.  Previously, he did not need a security clearance.  (Exhibit 1; TR 
18-19, 39, 46; 79-80)  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Czechoslovakia and lived there until he was thirty years old.  In 1975 he received a master's degree in Czechoslovakia.  He left 
Czechoslovakia in April 1981 because his country was a communist country, and he did not agree with the communist policy.  Initially, he was granted political 
asylum in Italy.  He emigrated to the United States (US) in January 1982 and was granted political asylum.  He immediately started working as a technician for 
Company #1 in February 1982.  He became a naturalized US citizen in August 1987 and has strong ties to the US.  After he married in the US in November 
1991, his wife, a citizen of the Czech Republic, became a permanent resident of the US.  His daughter who was born in October 1992 is a US citizen.  He has a 
home in the US which he restored and expanded.  He has also purchased an adjacent property as an investment property.  (Exhibit 1, Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, I, J, 
K, L; TR 18-19, 23-28, 32-33, 35, 38-41, 44, 49-51, 56, 60)</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant describes his ties to his country of origin as "close to none," he admits:</P> 
 
<P> His mother who is 81 and his brother are citizens of and reside in the Czech Republic; however, his mother is retired.  His mother used to work in a job 
where she was responsible for maintenance of a school.  His mother came to the US in 1983 to convince him to return, and he declined.  His mother and brother 
visited the US in 1987; he now calls her once a week.  He does not have a close relationship to his brother who is four years older than he is; for example, he 
does not even know where his brother is employed, but knows that he works for a private company, not the government.  He visited his mother twice in 2000 as 
he extended a business trip to other countries to go to the Czech Republic.</P> 
 
<P> In 1991 he met his spouse who is a citizen of the Czech Republic; she applied for US naturalization in May 2001.  She had applied earlier but the paperwork 
was never acknowledged by immigration.  She has a mother and stepfather in the Czech Republic.  His wife has a dance school in the US.   </P> 
 
<P> His stepson who is a citizen of the Czech Republic attends high school in the US.  He will not be eligible for US citizenship until after his mother is 
naturalized. </P> 
 
<P> Applicant has financial interests in the Czech Republic.  He owns a building in Prague worth approximately $200,000 based on the value provided by a real 
estate agent; the official appraisal when he received it was $14,000.  His mother's family owned rental property which was taken over by the government in 
1956 and allowed to deteriorate; after the communist era ended, his mother applied to have the property restored to her, but it was in very bad shape.  Since she 
could not manage it herself, she gave it to Applicant in 1993 when it was worth approximately $14,000.  Because of "red tape" he was not able to begin the 
renovation until 1998.  In order to do the restoration he opened a bank account to pay for the work being done.  He maintains a checking account there with a 
balance that ranges from $1,200 to  approximately $8, 000.  He has invested approximately $45,000 in the property and is in the middle of renovating it.  He 
sees the property as an investment as he does not plan to move there.  He hopes to sell it in two years.</P> 
 
<P>(Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3; G, H, I, ; TR 19, 28-32, 39-41, 42-44, 46-48, 51-54, 56-59, 62-68, 71-72)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has substantial financial ties to the US with income over $100,000 and a 401(k) worth more than $100,000 as well as a house worth more than 
$350,000.  (Exhibits J, L; TR 49) Applicant uses his US passport exclusively to travel.  (TR 55) </P> 
 
<P>Given Applicant's history and willingness to leave his country when it was under communist rule, he accepted the danger that his departure might mean for his 
mother or brother in that earlier era and did not compromise his principles.  Since the change<A HREF="01-03017.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P> in government in his homeland in 1989, he believes that there is 
"not much to worry about" with respect to the potential for immediate family members to be coerced in a way that would pressure him to decide between 
loyalty to them and to the US.  His personal and financial interests in the US are substantially greater than the value of his investments in the Czech Republic.  
Further,  Applicant has a clear commitment to report any attempt to influence him.  Any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate 
family seem to be slight and clearly manageable; and his family has no ties to the government.  (Exhibit 3; Exhibits J, L; TR 57-59, 62)  He has no intention of 
ever returning to the Czech Republic to live.  (TR 60)  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>A long-time consultant to Company #1 and the former security officer (now retired) submitted letters of support for Applicant.  The consultant who has known 
him for almost tweny years attests that Applicant is a person of the highest integrity and ethical strands.  He understands the value of US citizenship.   The 
former security manager who has known him for twenty years found him to be "very trustworthy, knowledgeable and industrious. . . ."  (Exhibits A; TR 22, 45-46)</P> 
 
<P>His supervisor at Company #1 for twenty years, who is a vice-president, commended Applicant's extraordinary professional development from an entry level 
position to a management position.  He assessed Applicant as being an outstanding person with respect to his character, honesty and honor.  His knowledge of 
Applicant's present earnings and investments in the US were that their value overshadowed his investment in the Czech Republic.  (TR 74-76; 77-79)</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility divided into conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's 
access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the 
evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed the following relevant Adjudication Guidelines:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5) Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has rebutted the Government's security concerns over his possible foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a Parliamentary 
democracy and his investments there.  He has a mother and a sibling in the Czech Republic who are citizens there.  Applicant has relatively infrequent contacts 
with his mother with respect to visits there, but he frequently telephones his mother.  He has little contact with his brother.  His wife, also a citizen of the Czech 
Republic, is now a US resident and wants to become a US citizen.  His stepson is a citizen of the Czech Republic, but cannot become a US citizen until his 
mother does.  Also, Applicant has financial interests in the Czech Republic as his mother gave him an apartment building in 1993, originally valued at $14,000, 
but now estimated to be worth $200,000, which he is in the process of restoring.  To do that work he opened a bank account there which has a balance of 
$8,000.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or 
she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create 
the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests 
in other countries are also relevant to security decisions if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country and ( 8) a substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or 
-operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, these security concerns are mitigated by the fact that Applicant's relatives have no ties to their foreign government; nor is there any substantial 
likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence over Applicant.  Merely because of these family ties, Applicant is not vulnerable to duress.  Further, the 
extent of his financial interests in the Czech Republic has to be balanced against the substantial financial ties he has in the US with his long-term professional 
career, his home ownership, and his retirement investments.  While he placed a high value on the apartment building which was a gift from his mother, in fact, 
it is still unrestored and not an asset that would motivate him to be vulnerable to foreign influence.   Looking at the property and his bank account in context of 
his US ties and investments, I conclude that the foreign investment falls within mitigating condition (5): his foreign financial interests are minimal and not 
sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities. Given his history and willingness to leave his country when it was under communist rule, when he 
accepted the danger that his departure might mean for his mother or brother in that earlier era, he does not fit the profile of an individual who would be easily 
subject to undue influence so as to become a security risk.  Further, since the change in government in his homeland in 1989 and the country's democratic 
political system, he believes that there is "not much to worry about" with respect to the potential for immediately family members to be coerced in a way that 
would pressure him to decide between loyalty to them and to the US.  His interests in the US are greater than the value of his investments in the Czech 
Republic.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, I think it improbable that his any of Applicant's family members would create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information.  
Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, 
or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Given Applicant's clear commitment to report any attempt to influence him, any risk of foreign 
duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable as his family there has no ties to the 
government.  His wife and step-son live in the US with intentions of being US citizens when the law permits.  Security clearance decisions are predictive 
judgments about an applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 
518, 528-29 (1988). Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant careful scrutiny.  After considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, here I conclude these ties to a parliamentary democracy are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure, so 
they do not invoke foreign influence concerns.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P>
