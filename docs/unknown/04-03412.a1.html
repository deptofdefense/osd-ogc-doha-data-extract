<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 9, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 16, 2006, 
after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant 
to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge committed harmful error in admitting into evidence the expert 
testimony and expert report of Applicant's witness; and whether the Judge's application of Guideline M Mitigating Condition 1 and  his mitigation of the 
security concerns under Guideline M and Guideline E, and his whole-person analysis  were arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record evidence.  The 
Board affirms the Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's arguments lack merit.  With regard to the first issue raised, Department Counsel contends that Applicant gave him short notice of 
Applicant's intent to call an expert witness and particularly short notice of the expert report Applicant intended to offer into evidence.  However, Department 
Counsel could have requested a continuance, but did not do so.  Department Counsel argued at the hearing against the admission of the expert report into 
evidence because the Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) would require submission of the notes used by the expert to prepare his report 
along with the report itself.  He repeated this interpretation of FRCP 26 in his appeal brief.  The FRCP are not binding in decisions issued under the Directive, 
and it was not error for the Administrative Judge to admit the report without submission of the notes.  Moreover, the report was largely repetitive of the expert 
testimony to which  Department Counsel did not object.<A HREF="04-03412.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>With regard to Department Counsel's arguments on mitigation, the Administrative Judge had substantial evidence on which to base his conclusions.  The 
expert witness testified that in his opinion Applicant had not misused his computer since he was terminated and would not do so in the future.  The Judge  gave 
a rational explanation for his application of Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="04-03412.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and his conclusions regarding mitigation under Guideline M and Guideline E.  The Judge 
likewise stated a reasonable and factually supported basis for his favorable conclusions under the whole-person concept.  The unfavorable evidence cited by 
Department Counsel is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by the record evidence.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  
Department Counsel's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a 
manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's decision to conclude that it is sustainable.<EM>  See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 04-09684 at 3 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).</P>
