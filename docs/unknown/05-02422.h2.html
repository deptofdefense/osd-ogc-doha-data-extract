<P>Applicant, a longtime security-clearance holder, engaged in an affair with Jane Doe, a married, subordinate employee.  In June 2000, after investigating the matter, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the company terminated or fired 
Applicant because: </SPAN>(a) Applicant engaged in disparate treatment of employees by showing undue favoritism toward Jane Doe; (b) Applicant had an extramarital affair with Jane Doe, a  subordinate 
employee, and he lied to the company vice-president by denying the affair; and (c) Applicant misused  company resources by submitting petty-cash receipts and travel receipts used to carry on the affair. 
Applicant failed to successfully mitigate the resulting personal conduct security concern. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is challenging the Defense Department's preliminary decision to deny or revoke his security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> on October 21, 2005, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a 
security concern under Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant replied to the SOR on November 8, 2005, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 19, 2006. The next 
month a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for March 8, 2006. Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript on March 16, 
2006.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In his written reply to the SOR, Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. In addition, after considering the record evidence as a whole, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>1. Applicant is a 47-year-old senior network engineer employed by a contractor to the Defense Department. He has worked for this company since February 2003. His annual salary is about $82,000. He 
has held a security clearance for many years as a soldier and as a defense contractor. </P> 
 
<P>2. Applicant married his first wife in March 1980 and they divorced in February 2001. He married his current wife in February 2002. He has four minor stepchildren in his household, and he is in the 
process of adopting the youngest stepchild.</P> 
 
<P>3. Applicant served as a soldier in the U.S. Army from about April 1977 until June 1994. He took an early-out retirement allowing him to retire with less than 20 years of service. His retired at the grade 
of sergeant first class (paygrade E-7).  </P> 
 
<P>4. In about April 1995, Applicant began working as an at-will employee for a small company that provided technology or computer services to military customers. Applicant held a security clearance for 
this job, and he worked his way up from his initial position of software trainer to senior network engineer. In about July 1998, with the backing of the company, he opened a retail computer store. As the 
store manager, he hired several employees, including a woman who is now his wife. His relationship with this woman (Jane Doe) led to allegations of impropriety, which were investigated by the 
company vice-president in June 2000. This investigation resulted in Applicant's termination from employment on or about June 15, 2000. </P> 
 
<P>5. SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges that Applicant was terminated on June 15, 2000, for violations of company policy not otherwise specified. Applicant denies this allegation, but I find the evidence is 
sufficient to prove it. The vice-president testified unequivocally that Applicant was terminated or fired for the following reasons: (a) Applicant engaged in disparate treatment of employees by showing 
undue favoritism toward Jane Doe; (b) Applicant had an extramarital affair with Jane Doe, a subordinate employee, and he lied to the company vice-president by denying the affair; and (c) Applicant 
misused  company resources by submitting petty-cash receipts and travel receipts used to carry on the affair.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In making this finding, I found the vice-president's testimony was wholly credible. In the 
vice-president's opinion, Applicant lacks honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and good judgment.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>6. SOR subparagraph 1.b alleges that Applicant downloaded "pornographic" material onto his company computer during the period April 1995 to June 2000. Applicant denies this allegation, and I find 
the evidence is inconclusive and insufficient to prove it. The basis for this allegation is what was found on Applicant's computer immediately after he was fired. The vice-president testified they found 
"several very incriminating e-mails,"<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> one of which acknowledged membership at a website for pornographic cartoons. Other than the vice-president's testimony, the government did not offer any other 
evidence (e.g., the e-mails, material  from the website, etc.) to show the pornographic nature of the materials. Accordingly, the vice-president's testimony, standing alone, is not enough to prove that the 
materials were pornographic as that term is used in the law.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Had the SOR alleged sexually-explicit material as opposed to pornographic material, my finding here may have been different. </P> 
 
<P>7. SOR subparagraph 1.c alleges that Applicant used a company credit card to pay for  downloading pornographic material onto his company computer during the period April 1995 to June 2000. 
Applicant denies this allegation, and I find the evidence is inconclusive and insufficient to prove it. According to the vice-president, shortly after Applicant was fired, the company received a credit card 
bill that contained a charge for the cartoon website. The registration against the credit card matched the registration on Applicant's computer. Other than this testimony, the government did not offer any 
other evidence (e.g., the credit card account statement, company records, etc.) to support this allegation. Given the absence of any documentary evidence tying Applicant to the credit card charges, the 
record evidence is not enough to prove this allegation. </P> 
 
<P>8. SOR subparagraph 1.d alleges that Applicant used a company credit card in 1999 or 2000 to pay for Jane Doe to travel for out-of-town company business when she had no reason to accompany 
Applicant. Applicant denies this allegation, and I find the evidence is inconclusive and insufficient to prove it. Again, given the absence of any documentary evidence showing that Applicant made 
specific charges to a company credit card for specific travel, the record evidence is not enough to prove this allegation. </P> 
 
<P>9. Applicant has continuously denied having an extramarital affair with Jane Doe while she was his subordinate employee, and he reaffirmed his denials during his testimony. His denials are not 
credible. In making this credibility finding, I am relying, in part, on my observations of Applicant's sincerity and demeanor while he testified, as well as how he might be affected by the outcome of this 
case. In addition, I considered the following circumstances. First, Applicant was giving Jane Doe preferential treatment at work. Second, Applicant took long lunches, two hours or so, with Jane Doe. 
Third, Jane Doe's husband met with the vice-president during the investigation and showed him a hotel receipt found in Jane Doe's purse. It was dated April 2000, and it was signed by Applicant for a 
hotel room in a nearby town. Applicant listed his parents' address in another state on the receipt. Fourth, on several occasions Jane Doe's husband followed her after work and saw Jane Doe go directly 
from work to Applicant's apartment. Fifth, when Applicant was told his services were no longer needed, Applicant departed the computer store and was followed out the door by Jane Doe who never 
returned to work. Sixth, Jane Doe moved in with Applicant shortly after the termination and they lived together until they were married. Taken together, these circumstances show Applicant was having 
an affair with Jane Doe while she was his subordinate employee.</P> 
 
<P>10. Three character witnesses provided highly favorable character evidence for Applicant. The witnesses are retired or former military officers who now work with Applicant.  The witnesses vouched for 
Applicant's knowledge, skills, and abilities as an employee. And the witnesses vouched for Applicant's suitability to hold a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each 
guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors 
listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting a clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in 
favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been 
controverted.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> And as noted by the Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information. Conduct or behavior involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. While working as a cleared employee of a defense contractor, Applicant had an extramarital affair 
with a subordinate employee. The company terminated or fired Applicant because: </SPAN>(a) Applicant engaged in disparate treatment of employees by showing undue favoritism toward Jane Doe; (b) 
Applicant had an extramarital affair with Jane Doe, a subordinate employee, and he lied to the company vice-president by denying the affair; and (c) Applicant misused  company resources by 
submitting petty-cash receipts and travel receipts used to carry on the affair. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taken together, this unfavorable information from a previous employer raises a security concern within the meaning of DC 
1,<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> DC 4,<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and DC 5.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The record evidence shows Applicant engaged in significant workplace misconduct and he was terminated or fired as a result. To sum up, his past workplace misconduct 
shows poor judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and untrustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to his case in mitigation, I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude only MC 5<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> applies in his favor, because this incident took place approximately six years ago 
and it has not recurred. These circumstances are positive steps that support his case in mitigation, but are not enough to overcome the case against him. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, I remain concerned about whether Applicant has provided a full, frank, and truthful accounting of his past conduct.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Applicant has continuously denied having an affair with Jane Doe 
while she was his subordinate employee, and he continued to make this denial during his testimony. As noted above in Finding No. 9, his explanations or denials were not credible. I considered his lack 
of credibility for certain limited purposes. First, it causes me to discount his testimony in general. And second, it indicates he has not accepted full responsibility for his actions, which militates against 
his evidence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes.<A HREF="05-02422.h2.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> At bottom, his lack of credibility erodes his case in mitigation. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the record evidence as a whole--including </SPAN></P>
