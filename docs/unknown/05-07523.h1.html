<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant used illegal chemical substances while possessing a security clearance. Her credibility is extremely suspect, as she has not been truthful or candid with information that she furnished to 
the United States Government. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On January 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 
2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Applicant <EM></EM> filed a notarized response, dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">February 5, 2006</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on March 14, 2006, to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 10, 2006, and the 
hearing was conducted on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 28, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 12 documentary exhibits (Government's Exhibits 1-12) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit (Applicant's Exhibit 
A) and offered her own testimony and that of one </SPAN>additional witness<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> offered four additional letters of reference (Exhibit B) and a supplement to her Security Clearance Application (SCA) 
</SPAN>(Exhibit C).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Exhibit C was objected to by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. I have overruled the objection and allowed </SPAN>Exhibit C<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> into evidence. The transcript (Tr) was received on May 10, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the 
Directive. The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., under Guideline H, one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline J., and  five allegations, 3.a. through 3.e., under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration 
of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 31 years old. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN>     </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has abused illegal substances. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant used marijuana on at least two occasions in April and May 2003.  She also used amphetamines,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> at least one time in May 2003.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> used these substances while she was a member 
of the United States Army and while she held a Department of Defense security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On April 19, 2003, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> was parked in her vehicle with a friend, who was using marijuana. The local police searched her vehicle, found the </SPAN>marijuana<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> and also found a military baton, that 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> had left in her vehicle, after serving that day in her position in the Army where she was attached to the Military Police. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  was charged with Manufacture, Sale or Possession of 
Disguised Firearms or Other Deadly Weapons, a felony and Possession of Less Than One Ounce of </SPAN>Marijuana<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. She pled guilty to a reduced charge of Fighting, Causing Loud Noise or Using 
Offensive Words in a Public Place and was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to pay a fine of $250.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> testified that before the drug usage in 2003, she had only used marijuana one time when she was 16 years old. She contended that the reason she used the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">marijuana </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">on the above stated 
occasions was because of her anger at being arrested in April 2003. She claimed that after she was released from jail she was so upset that she decided to use marijuana. Later when she was told that 
her actions may result in her being forced to leave the Army she used marijuana again. Despite her explanation, using marijuana after her arrest shows extremely poor judgement and irresponsible 
behavior. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> was tested for drug usage she was also found to have amphetamines in her system.  She testified that she did not recall taking the amphetamines, but she did state that she may have 
done so during the period when she was heavily imbibing alcohol.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On July 29, 2003, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> was charged by the Army of Wrongful Use and Possession of dangerous Drugs. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> separated from the Army on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 12, 2003, in lieu of court-martial due 
to that charge.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has engaged in criminal conduct. Applicant's conduct as discussed in Paragraph 1, above, violated 
both civilian and military statutes and regulations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she furnished untruthful information to the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July 28, 2004.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #21 of the SCA asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any Felony Offense(s). Applicant answered "No." Applicant did not list that she was arrested and  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">charged with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Manufacture, Sale or Possession of Disguised Firearms or Other Deadly Weapons, which is a felony,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as has been alleged in 1.d. of the SOR, and discussed above.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #24 of the SCA asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant answered "No." Applicant did not list that she was 
arrested and  charged with Possession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana, as alleged in 1.d. of the SOR, and discussed above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #25 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the SCA asked if, in the last seven years Applicant had been subject to court martial or other proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Applicant answered 
"No." She did not list that she was charged under the UCMJ with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Wrongful Use and Possession of Dangerous Drugs, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as alleged in 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR, and discussed above</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In </SPAN>addition to the inaccurate responses to the questions that have been alleged in the SOR<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and discussed above, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also was not truthful in other responses in her SCA. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #27 of the SCA asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had used illegal drugs, including marijuana, etc. Applicant answered "yes" and responded, that she had used marijuana on 
two occasions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not list her use of amphetamines as alleged in 1.b. of the SOR, and discussed above</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #28 of the SCA asked if Applicant had ever used illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered "No." She did not list that she had used </SPAN>marijuana<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and 
amphetamines while she held a security clearance as alleged in 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR, and discussed above</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">While Questions #27 and 28 were not alleged by the Government, I have considered them in determining </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> overall honesty and credibility. Applicant</SPAN> clearly did not furnish honest and 
complete information to the Government <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the SCA that she completed on July 28, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did submit a post hearing document (Exhibit C),which was allegedly attached to <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> SCA. The information furnished in Exhibit C does not resolve the inaccurate and incomplete 
information that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> submitted in response to the SCA questions, which have been discussed above. </P> 
 
<P>Finally, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did submit four letters of reference (Exhibit B),which are extremely positive regarding <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given "binding" 
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically 
determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of 
the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General 
Factors]:</P> 
 
<P>a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e. The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g. The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with 
the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. The 
Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug usage, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct, 
and that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based 
on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security 
clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh 
the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the use of marijuana and amphetamines is of concern, especially in light 
of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The fact that Applicant used illegal substances, while holding a security clearance, and while a member of the United States military must also be 
considered adversely. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A8.1.2.1.), <EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and 
DC (E2.A8.1.2.2.), </SPAN><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Since Applicant last used </SPAN>the marijuana and amphetamin<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">es in May 2003, Applicant's conduct could be argued to come within Mitigating Condition(MC) (E2.A8.1.3.1.),  the drug involvement was 
not recent. MC (E2.A8.1.3.3.) could also be argued to apply because of Applicant's stated intention not to continue using illegal substances in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving that Applicant used illegal drugs under Guideline H. Applicant, has attempted to introduce evidence in rebuttal, explanation or 
mitigation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">However, based on the fact that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, after she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, and that she has not 
been honest in the information that she furnished to the Government regarding her drug usage, I do not find that the mitigating conditions are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sufficient to overcome the Government's case against 
her. Accordingly, Paragraph 1, Guideline H, is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in </SPAN>criminal conduct, by her use of illegal substances.</P> 
 
<P>DC (E2.A10.1.2.1.), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, and DC (E2.A10.1.2.2), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, 
apply in this case.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant</SPAN> has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline E -Personal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the Government incomplete, untruthful answers in the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SCA that she executed on July 28, 2004</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish 
relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In 
this case, I conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers to the Government.</P> 
 
<P>In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN>applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> deliberately provided false and  misleading information to the Government in a SCA.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>No 
Cs apply in this paragraph. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Applicant's conduct, considered as a whole, including her drug usage, especially while holding a security clearance, and the misinformation that she provided to the 
Government, exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 3, </SPAN>Guideline E, against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has ingested illegal substances while holding a security clearance (Guideline H), that she has 
engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), and she has exhibited poor judgement and untrustworthy behavior (Guideline E). Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against her. Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against Applicant.</P>
