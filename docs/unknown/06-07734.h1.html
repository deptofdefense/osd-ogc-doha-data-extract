<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has longstanding delinquent debt totaling $13,537. He has not made any good faith efforts to resolve the debt. Applicant
deliberately failed to list his delinquent accounts on his trustworthiness application.  He has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal
conduct. Applicant's eligibility for a trustworthiness position is denied.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>On October 21, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 28, 2006,
DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F,
Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P>

<P>On August 19, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's
written case on October 12, 2006. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on October 17, 2006, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant did not submit any information or written response to the FORM by November 16, 2006. The case was assigned to me on January
11, 2007.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULING ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P>On October 11, 2006, the government moved to amend the SOR. The introductory paragraph on page one was struck in its entirety and replaced with:</P>

<P>A review of your eligibility for occupying Information Systems Position designated ADP-II to support a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) has been made pursuant to DoD Directive
5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, This office recommends that your case be submitted to an Administrative Judge for a determination that you are not eligible for occupying such a position. </P>

<P>The Applicant did not object to the motion. I granted the government's motion to amend the SOR. </P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F, but denied the allegation under Guideline E concerning his alleged failure to disclose debts on his ADP application.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The
admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>Applicant is a single, 29-year-old claims auditor of a defense contractor, seeking a position of public trust. After graduating from high school, he worked and attended a community college. He 
received an associate degree in 1998, and continued to take college courses and work. He received his undergraduate degree in 2003. He has no prior military experience. He has been with his
current employer since October 2004.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> His 2005 performance evaluation rated him as "exceeding expectations."<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 21, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He answered "No" in response to question 22.b. Your Financial Record - 180 Day Delinquencies which
reads: "Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.)." His background investigation
revealed nine delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $13,537.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<P>Applicant's nine debts in SOR &para; 1.a through 1.i are not disputed.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He provided no information on the origin of the debts. He acknowledges that all the debts are delinquent and "currently not in
repayment." Several of the debts have been in collection since 1999.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The record is devoid of any information concerning counseling or debt consolidation plans. Although Applicant, proclaimed
he is committed to the repayment of the debt, he admitted his current strained financial situation would need to improve before he could plan to repay the debt. Applicant did not  provide any
mitigating conditions involving medical problems or other extenuating circumstances. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>His outstanding debts corresponding to the SOR &para; 1. a. through 1.i.  are as follows: $1,883 credit account in collection in June 1999; $4,969 credit account in collection in October 1999; $293 
account charged off in November 1999; $1,943 account charged off in July 2000; $2,354 collection account July 2000; $880 account in collection in November 2000; $451 account in collection in
September 2001; $467 medical account in collection in October 2001; and $297 medical account in collection in October 2001.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant's October public trust application reveals employment with a book store from October 1994 until January 2001. From January 2001 until June 2001 he was unemployed. He worked with
a newspaper for approximately four months in 2001 and was again unemployed from October 2001 until October 2002. He worked as a research data manager from October 2002 until December
2003. His last period of unemployment lasted from December 2003 until October 2004, when he gained his current position. He provided no details about his unemployment or how it directly
impacted his finances in any of his responses to the SOR.<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>Applicant has a net monthly income of $1,760. The reported expenses of $1,683 left a net remainder of $32. Applicant is currently paying the minimum amount on four accounts listed on his
financial statement .<A HREF="06-07734.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He has no savings or assets except his automobile. His 2006 credit report lists  several student loans in forbearance.</P>

<P>Applicant denied that he deliberately failed to list his delinquent debts on his public trust application form because "he misread or misunderstood question 22." It was in no way my intention to
report false, inaccurate, or misleading information." He stated he is committed to total compliance with regard to the truthful release of any and all information requested as part of his
trustworthiness procedure. He did not elaborate on why or how he misunderstood the question. The debts have been charged off or placed in collection since 1999. I do not find his vague statement
reasonable under the circumstances.</P>

<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or
irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Guideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and
discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations, and
Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </P>

<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P>

<P>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant had difficulty meeting his financial obligations since 1999.  Currently, he has nine delinquent debts with an approximate total
balance of $13,537. He admits his financial situation is strained. His 2006 credit report confirms the debt.</P>

<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant's delinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not
recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because he still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt.</P>

<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a
death, divorce, or separation) </EM>does not apply<EM>.</EM> Applicant had periods of unemployment, but provided no evidence as to the effect on his finances. Moreover, some of the debt precedes the
unemployment. Two accounts are for medical care, but the majority are consumer accounts. Applicant provided no evidence to support this mitigating condition. Also, an applicant's actions towards
resolving the debt should be considered.</P>

<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply.
Applicant indicates that he intends to repay based on an improved financial situation. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. All of the  debts
remain outstanding. He has not taken steps to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial problems remain.  It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future. The record is devoid of any
information concerning financial counseling.</P>

<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that he established a record of steady
payments or financial stability. He made no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent accounts  I cannot conclude that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts despite his good intentions. <STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying
for a security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P>

<P>In this case, Applicant explained that he did not list his delinquent debts in response to question 22 on the public trust application because he did not understand the question. He  did not provide
any reason for this misunderstanding.  I find that he intentionally withheld information about his delinquent debts in response to question 22 on his public trust application signed by him on October
21, 2004.  In his financial interrogatories, dated May 2006, Applicant acknowledges that he has the debts and has not paid due to a strained financial situation. The evidence indicates that he was
aware of his financial situation when he filled out his public trust application.</P>

<P>Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.  Although Applicant claims that he had no intent to report false, inaccurate, or misleading information, he provides no reasonable
explanation for not listing his debts. He was required to provide a truthful answer to question 22. When he signed the application, he certified that his answers were "true, complete, and correct to
best of his knowledge and belief and are made in good faith." However, he admits that he had the debts, but did not list them on his public trust application. I find his actions were deliberate.</P>

<P>I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct concern. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P>

<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P>

<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has
negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness position based on his deliberate failure to disclose his delinquent debts and his lack of action towards
resolving his delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility
is denied.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT</P>

<P>Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant</P>

<P>Subparagraph 2.a.   Against Applicant</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant's request for a determination of trustworthiness and
eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
