<P>Applicant deliberately falsified her February 2002 clearance application. Her personal conduct renders her an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. 
Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 9 March 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial of her clearance 
because of personal conduct and criminal conduct.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 31 March 2004 and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 28 
June 2004, and I convened a hearing on 27 July 2004. DOHA received the transcript 10 August 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 24-year-old scan technician  at a defense contractor--seeks clearance for access to classified information. She has not previously held a clearance</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant started her clearance processing on 1 February 2002, when she completed and signed her security clearance application. She did not disclose a May 
2000 arrest for marijuana possession and possessing a stolen temporary license plate in response to either question 24 (drugs) or 26 (other arrests). She also did 
not disclose any of her five debts totaling nearly $2,200.00<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>--all of which had been past due since at least August 2000--on either question 38 or 39 (debts 
greater than 90 or 180 days past due). She also falsified a 30 April 2002 sworn statement when she claimed the marijuana was found in the car she had 
borrowed to run an errand; in fact, the marijuana was found in a jeans jacket she was wearing at the time--albeit a jacket she found in the borrowed car and put 
on because it was cold.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sworn statement, answer, and testimony present varied and contradictory explanations for her omissions, none of which obscure the essential facts: 
Applicant knew she had a May 2000 drug arrest and delinquent accounts and did not disclose them, seek guidance whether she should disclose them, or obtain 
records that would reveal to her whether she should disclose them. She acknowledges she did not want her employer to know about the marijuana arrest. She 
provided no character evidence to support her case.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline E and Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. She falsified the answer to four questions on her 
security questionnaire that would have uncovered criminal conduct and financial problems to increase her chances of getting her clearance.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She later 
misrepresented the circumstances of her arrest to a government investigator.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> None of the mitigating factors apply. I conclude Guideline E against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also established its case under Guideline J.<A HREF="02-25917.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's falsifications violate the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001, and she provided insufficient 
mitigation of her conduct. I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
