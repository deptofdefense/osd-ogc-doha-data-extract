<P>The Applicant's casual and infrequent foreign contacts with his father, mother and other relatives in Russia pose no security risk.  He is no longer associated 
with anyone else in Russia or with the Russian government and cannot be coerced or blackmailed.  He has surrendered his Russian passport to the proper 
authorities and it has been cancelled.  He has renounced his Russian citizenship.  Clearance is granted.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 12, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 29, 2005, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the 
undersigned on September 9, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 4, 2005.  At the hearing the 
Government presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented six exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open to allow the Applicant an 
opportunity to support his testimony with documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
October 17, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 40 years of age and holds a 
aster's Degree in Physics.  He is employed as a Scientist for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Russia.  He and his wife, who was also born in Russia, came to the United States with their children in 1994.  They came to the 
United States as refugees of Jewish origin.  The Applicant, his wife and his children became United States citizen in March 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a mother, father, step-father and half-sister, a mother-in-law and two  friends who are citizens of and residents of Russia.   The Applicant's 
mother and father are retired doctors and his step-father is a retired physicist.  (Tr. p. 30-31).  In the last five years the Applicant has spoken to his father by 
telephone about once a year and has seen him one time.  The Applicant's mother comes to visit the Applicant in the United States about once or twice a year.  
The Applicant is currently in the process of trying to bring his step-sister from Russia to the United States.  The Applicant's half-brother, an engineer, and his 
family have resided in the United States since 1998 and are awaiting their United States citizenship.       </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Applicant's relatives mentioned in the SOR work for the Russian government or any government.  None of them are in a position to be exploited or 
blackmailed in any way.  (Tr. 17).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the past eleven years since the Applicant left Russia, he has been back on three separate occasions, once in 1999, 2002 and 2003 for a total of twelve days.  
(Tr. p. 34).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has purchased a condominium in the United States.  The total value of his assets considering the equity in his home in the United States are 
$300,000.  (Tr. p. 42).  He has no assets of any kind in Russia.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was employed as a physicist from August 1986 until November 1994 by the Institute of Applied Physics in Russia which was run by the 
Government of Russia.  He was in the field of experimental physics in the area of physical oceanography.  He has never applied for a security clearance in 
Russia nor was he privy to any state secrets.  (Tr. p. 33).     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that the job he does now in the United States may be of interest to the Russian intelligence agencies.  (Tr. p. 38).  At one point the 
Applicant was unwilling to relinquish his expired Russian passport to Russian authorities because he did not want to reveal that he was in the process of 
obtaining a United States Department of Defense security clearance and have them watch closely during his future visits to Russia or in the event that he might 
need to travel to Russia immediately for a family emergency.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 2).  After learning of the DOD policy that prohibits one from 
possessing a foreign passport while holding a security clearance, the Applicant relinquished his Russian passport to the Russian authorities.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's 
Exhibit A and his Post-Hearing Exhibit).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Four letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant by coworkers and professional associates indicate that the Applicant is considered to be 
highly intelligent and inventive.  He has established strong ties with his community.  He is considered trustworthy and honest.  He is a tireless employee who 
often goes beyond requirements to insure that a job is done well and on schedule.  He has been promoted at a pace far above scientists with similar experience 
and job classification.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C, D, E and F).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates that he has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the 
United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of 
the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide 
by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct 
and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Disqualifying Condition <EM>(1) an immediate family member, 
or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM> applies.  However, 
itigating Conditions <EM>(1)  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or 
associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between the loyalty of the person(s) involved and the United States </EM>and<EM> (3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM> are 
applicable. Although the Applicant's mother, father, step-father, half-sister, mother-in-law and two friends are citizens and residents of Russia, none of the 
individuals are associated with the Russian government or any government nor are they in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or in a position 
to be exploited by the Russia Government or any government in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the 
United States.  Therefore, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would ever consider any attempt at exploitation.  Furthermore, the Applicant's 
contacts with his foreign relatives and friends are very limited, and are not of a nature to influence his security worthiness.  The Applicant has cut almost all of 
his ties with Russia, except his contact with his mother.  The Applicant has made it clear that he understands his responsibility to the United States in holding a 
security clearance.  Based on the foregoing, the Applicant does not raise a security concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
