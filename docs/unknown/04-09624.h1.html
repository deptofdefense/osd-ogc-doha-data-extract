<P>Applicant engaged in multiple acts of criminal conduct between 1995 and 2003, including drug, alcohol, and weapons offenses, breach of the peace, and intentionally making several false statements to 
the government regarding information material to an assessment of his suitability to hold a clearance. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On November 2, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts in Applicant's background 
investigation that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>This case was originally assigned to another administrative judge on February 17, 2006, but transferred to me on March 1, 2006. I convened a hearing on April 26, 2006. The parties appeared as 
scheduled and the government presented 11 exhibits (Gx1 - 11). Applicant and one other witness testified. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on May 8, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed as an electrician since November 2003 by a defense contractor supporting construction, maintenance, and overhaul of U.S. Navy nuclear submarines. 
Applicant was married in October 1998, but divorced in 2000. Applicant now lives with his 10-year-old son and his elderly father. He graduated in 1993 from a vocational/technical school.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been arrested four times. In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit first degree robbery, breach of peace, weapon in a vehicle, and possession of cocaine. 
Applicant had participated in a scheme to rob two people by luring them to a parking lot behind a business, where two other people laying in wait robbed the two at knife point. Police arrested 
Applicant, his girlfriend (and future wife) and the two robbers at the scene. The robbers were found hiding in Applicant's car, in which police found knives, drugs, firearms and ammunition. Applicant 
spent about a month in jail awaiting trial, and was found guilty of a lesser charge of hindering prosecution after he agreed to testify against his co-conspirators. He was sentenced to three years in jail less 
time already served. The jail sentence was suspended and he was placed on three years probation.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his statements to government investigators during his background investigation,<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and in his DOHA hearing testimony, Applicant offered a version of events regarding the 1995 arrest which  differs 
almost completely from the information contained in police reports generated at the time of those events. Having observed Applicant's demeanor during his testimony and weighed his claims against the 
government's information, I specifically find Applicant has been repeatedly evasive about his role in this crime and that the more reliable version of events is that which is contained in the police reports 
and other official documents produced by the government.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was next arrested in 1999 and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. He had consumed at least three beers within a short period of time. His driver's license was 
suspended for three months and he was ordered to attend an alcohol safety awareness class.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also was twice arrested and charged with breach of the peace. In 1999, he got into an argument with his ex-wife and a friend at a party. The argument escalated into a physical altercation and 
the police were called.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> There is no information about the ultimate disposition of this charge. In 2002, Applicant got into a physical altercation with a co-worker for which he was arrested at his place of 
work, taken to a police station, photographed, and fingerprinted before being released.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He was later convicted of breach of the peace and fined $50. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his DOHA hearing, a union representative testified Applicant was involved in a dispute and confrontation at work in May 2005, which resulted in Applicant and the other party being suspended for 
three days. The union representative testified the other party felt threatened.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1998 and 2003, Applicant incurred several unpaid debts totaling about $25,800. More specifically, seven of his debts were reduced to civil judgments by his creditors, one of whom was the 
lawyer who handled his divorce. Twelve other debts were either charged off as business losses or referred to collection agencies. Applicant never paid his debts or satisfied the judgments, but obtained a 
discharge of his obligations when he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in 2005.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 17, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86). In response to question 38, which asked him to list any debts during the prior seven years that were more than 180 days 
delinquent, and question 39, regarding debts more than 90 days past due at the time he completed the SF 86, he answered "yes," but listed only two debts - a delinquent medical bill for $4,500 and a 
delinquent wireless phone bill for $2,500.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant knew he had more debts that fit these questions, but did not list them because he "was unsure of what the Defense Dept wanted me to tell them 
about my debts."<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> In response to question 37, which asked him to list any unpaid judgements for debts in the prior seven years, he answered "no," thereby omitting the seven unpaid judgments 
discussed, above.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> At a minimum, Applicant was aware of some of the debts underlying these judgments.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to question 24 of his SF 86, which asked him to list any alcohol or drug offenses he was ever charged with or convicted of, Applicant answered "no," thereby omitting from the form his 
arrest for cocaine possession in 1995 and his DUI in 1999. In response to question 26 of the SF 86, which asked Applicant to list any other criminal arrests, charges, or convictions (other than traffic 
violations resulting in fines less than $150) in the prior seven years not addressed in other SF 86 questions about criminal conduct, he answered "no," thereby omitting his two arrests for breach of 
peace.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the background investigation subsequent to his SF 86, Applicant was interviewed by government investigators three times. In the first interview on February 11, 2004, he discussed his 2002 
arrest for breach of the peace stemming from his altercation with a co-worker. Applicant denied he was arrested and charged with any offense, claiming instead he went to the police station to complain 
about his co-worker. During the same interview, Applicant denied any wrongdoing regarding his 1995 arrest and claimed he was unaware he had been charged with possession of cocaine, having a 
weapon in a vehicle, and conspiracy to commit robbery.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also during his first interview, Applicant asserted he was unaware of the judgments against him. In a second interview on February 18, 2004, Applicant again asserted he did not know about the 
judgments or that he had been originally charged with drug, weapon, and conspiracy offenses before his plea agreement in 1995.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> A third interview was conducted on June 10, 2004, in which 
Applicant provided an accurate account of his 2002 breach of peace arrest. But Applicant again provided a version of his 1995 arrest and charges wherein he was innocent of any wrongdoing, and he 
again failed to acknowledge the original charges.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> At hearing, Applicant admitted he appeared in court with counsel after his arrest and the original charges were read aloud in his presence.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserted he omitted his arrests for breach of peace and for DUI because he had forgotten about them. After each arrest, he was transported to a police station in handcuffs, photographed and 
fingerprinted. He also stated he did not think the DUI was relevant.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of 
both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Directive, each decision must also reflect 
a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors collectively referred to as the "whole person concept" and listed in Section E2.2.1.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or 
mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they 
represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified information. The 
government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government does so, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Because the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own, no one has a right to a security clearance.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Accordingly, applicants bear a heavy burden of 
persuasion in the face of disqualifying information.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DISCUSSION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct. </STRONG>The government alleged the Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because he was arrested and charged with drug, weapon, and conspiracy charges in 
1995, and later convicted of a lesser sentence (SOR &para; 1.a); he was arrested, charged, and convicted of DUI in 1999 (SOR &para; 1.b); he was charged with breach of peace in 1999 and 2002 (SOR &para;&para; 1.c and 
1.d); and he deliberately made false statements in his 2003 SF 86, and in statements to government investigators in 2004, thereby violating federal criminal law as outlined in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 (SOR &para; 
1.e).</P> 
 
<P>The record contains sufficient evidence to support these allegations. Except for SOR &para; 1.e, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations of criminal conduct. The government also provided the Applicant's 
written statements about his criminal conduct, as well as other information about his arrests in the form of police and court records. As to SOR &para; 1.a, I did not find credible Applicant's claims he did 
nothing wrong. Indeed, his testimony was inconsistent with his prior statements to government investigators, and his accounts of what happened are themselves internally inconsistent and implausible. 
As to SOR &para; 1.e, and as discussed more fully under Guideline E, below, Applicant deliberately omitted information about his finances and criminal conduct when he submitted his SF 86. He did so 
when he signed the form immediately beneath an advisement that 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 made such conduct a criminal offense. He repeated the offense when he made false statements to government 
investigators in 2004. The written statements he reviewed and signed contained the same advisement that 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 applies.</P> 
 
<P>The facts established through SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.e establish a security concern addressed in the Directive through Guideline J; that is, a person who is willing to disregard the law <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or 
incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN> The criminal activity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple 
lesser offenses. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, the government's information proves these allegations and requires consideration of Guideline J DC </SPAN>1 and DC 2.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant engaged in criminal conduct from 1995 until at least 
2004. By contrast, Applicant has offered little information to support consideration of any of the Guideline J mitigating conditions that might apply to these facts.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN> I consider his criminal conduct to be 
recent, in that his multiple false statements occurred during his most recent background investigation. His conduct cannot be considered isolated because it has occurred several times since 1995. 
Further, the conduct at issue has not been the result of coercion or other undue pressure, and he was not acquitted of any of the charged offenses. Finally, nothing Applicant submitted in response to the 
government's case supports a conclusion he is rehabilitated and not likely to engage in future criminal conduct. To the contrary, his 2005 workplace dispute appears to be another instance of the conduct 
that led to two breach of the peace arrests, and his testimony about his criminal conduct in 1995 was evasive, to say the least. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the 
government's information about his criminal conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct. </STRONG>The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because he deliberately falsified answers to several questions on a security clearance 
application (SF 86) he signed as being true and accurate to the best of his knowledge on July 17, 2003. Specifically, the government alleged he intentionally omitted the fact he was arrested in 1995 and 
1999 for drug/alcohol-related charges when he answered "no" to question 24 (SOR &para; 2.a); he intentionally omitted the fact he was charged in 1999 and 2002 with breach of the peace when he answered 
"no" to question 26 (SOR &para; 2.b); he intentionally omitted the fact he had several unpaid judgments against him for unpaid debts when he answered "no" to question 37 (SOR &para; 2.c); he intentionally tried 
to mislead the government about the extent of his indebtedness when he answered "yes" to questions 38 and 39, but listed only two of the many debts he had (SOR &para;&para; 2.d and 2.e); and he intentionally 
provided false information about his 2002 breach of peace arrest and his 1995 arrest on drug, weapon, and conspiracy charges in a February 2004 statement to government investigators (SOR &para;&para; 2.f and 
2.g). </P> 
 
<P>The record contains sufficient information to support these allegations. The facts established through SOR &para;&para; 2.a - 2.g establish a security concern addressed in the Directive through Guideline E; that is, 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not 
properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant knew about his debts, and his arrests, and he deliberately tried to hide most of that information. When confronted by investigators, and during his 
DOHA testimony about his 1995 arrest, Applicant deliberately provided inconsistent statements about the details of his involvement in those crimes, and initially denied he had been charged with more 
serious crimes than the hindering prosecution offense of which he was ultimately convicted. His claim that he did not know about the original charges in 1995 directly contradicts his admission at 
hearing that the charges were read to him in open court after he was arrested. In response to the government's concerns about his SF 86 omissions of his 1999 and 2002 arrests, Applicant claimed he 
forgot about them. This position is not plausible in view of the fact he was taken into custody each time. With these falsifications in mind, I further conclude Applicant's partial disclosure of his debts in 
response to questions 38 and 39 shows he was attempting to mislead the government about his financial problems by minimizing the scope of his debt. It is clear from the totality of information about 
his debts that he knew he had at least 10 more debts than he listed and that he was probably aware of some of the judgments entered against him.</P> 
 
<P>These facts require consideration of Guideline E DC 2, DC 3, and DC 5.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN> By contrast, the record does not support any of the listed mitigating conditions that might be relevant to the information 
presented.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN> Available information about Applicant's lack of candor, including his own testimony, presents a picture of someone who has and will continue to lie to protect his own interests. Such 
conduct is directly at odds with the government's compelling interest in being able to trust cleared personnel to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate 
the security concerns raised by the government's information.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Concept. </STRONG>A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> of available information about Applicant's personal and criminal conduct, taken in the context of the record as a whole shows that 
reasonable doubts persist about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its 
interests. Applicant was about 23 years old and beyond what is generally thought of as adolescent or immature when he was first arrested in 1995. Even if he was immature, his additional adverse 
criminal and personal conduct in the subsequent 10 years reinforces the government's concerns about his suitability.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant has failed to present more than minimal information to  suggest he is in 
any way rehabilitated or that the conduct at issue will not recur. Indeed, his 2005 workplace dispute and the lack of credibility in his statements to the government and in his testimony suggest he will 
continue to exhibit poor judgment and lack of candor.<A HREF="04-09624.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></SPAN> Absent substantial information to mitigate these concerns, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has carried his burden of 
persuasion in response to the government's case.</P>
