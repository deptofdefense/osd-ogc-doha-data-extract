<P>Applicant's foreign preference, including possession and use of a valid foreign passport, and his foreign influence, including foreign family members, have 
been mitigated. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 31, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on May 20, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 23, 2004, scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2004.  At the hearing the Government 
presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant called three witnesses to testify on his behalf and he presented nine exhibits.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The 
official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 12, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, clarifying "the application of Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  The Applicant received a 
copy of this memorandum with the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 35 years of age and holds a 
asters Degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as a Communications Systems Engineer for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of India and the United States.  The Applicant was born in 1965 in India to Indian parents.  He first came to the United States in 
1989, to attend college.  Except for an eight month period where he was assigned by his company to work in Europe, he has remained in the United States since 
then.  In May 1999, he obtained an Indian passport that was not to expire until May 2019.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2001, the Applicant became a naturalized United States, and within a month, he applied for a United States passport.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits F 
and G).  The Applicant testified that under Indian Law, when you swear the oath of naturalization to another country, you automatically renounce your Indian 
citizenship.  The Applicant considered his Indian passport void at that time.  (Tr. p. 48).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still after learning of the provisions of the Money Memorandum, the Applicant returned his Indian passport to the Indian consulate to get it canceled.  (Tr. p. 
48).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2000, the Applicant purchased an apartment in India for his parents to live in.  He spent approximately $27,000.00 on the apartment.  The Applicant has 
no bank accounts or any other assets in India.  (Tr. p. 63).      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's spouse is a citizen of India and currently resides with the Applicant.  She came to the United States in 1994 to pursue her education.  She 
obtained a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering.  She and the Applicant were married in 1999.  They have a son who was born in the United States.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Applicant's Exhibit E).  She is currently a homemaker but will be starting to work soon.  She intends on applying for her United States citizenship when she 
becomes eligible in June 2005.  (Tr. p. 25).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's parents, one sister, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens of and reside in India.  His father is a retired Chemist who was employed by 
the Indian Government for thirty years.  He retired in 1998, receives a pension, and has no connection with the Indian Government since then.  He now works 
for a private company and supports his wife without difficulty.  His mother and sister in India are housewives and always have been.  The Applicant contacts 
his parents by telephone at least once every two months.  He also contacts them by e-mail about once a year.  The Applicant's parents have visited the Applicant 
in the United States on two occasions, every five years.  His mother-in-law is also a housewife who used to be employed as a school teacher.  His brother-in-law 
works for a private software company.  She receives her husband's pension from the Indian Government that supports her.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's other sister is also a citizen of India, however, she resides in the United States.  She is an engineer.  She is also in the process of obtaining her 
United States citizenship.  She also has a son who is a United States citizen.  She has no intent of moving back to India and has no contact or affiliation 
whatsoever with the Indian Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has traveled to India in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001.  Two of the four trips were for the specific purpose of transacting business for his company 
in the United States under the authority of his company.  The trip in 1999, was for the Applicant and his wife to get married in front of relatives in India 
pursuant to their religious customs.  In 2001, the trip was simply to visit family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant and his wife have other relatives in India including aunts, uncles and cousins.  His contact with these individuals is limited to once every three 
years or so.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's net worth in the United States is between  $700,000.00 and $800,000.00.  (Tr. p. 39 and Applicant's Exhibits A, B, and C).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  His wife, an engineer by profession,  testified that her husband and son are United States citizens and she 
plans on becoming one too.  Her father was at one time an Aeronautical Engineer for the Indian Air Force but he has since passed away.  (Tr. pp. 29-30).  Her 
mother is a house wife and she receives a pension from her husband that supports her.  None of her other family members are associated with the Indian 
Government in any way.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A friend and professional colleague testified that the Applicant has exemplary personal qualities.  He is considered responsible and of good judgment.  (Tr. pp. 
41-42).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A coworker of the Applicant testified that the Applicant is honest, ethical and trustworthy.  (Tr. pp. 44-45).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A letter of recommendation from a company manager indicates that the Applicant is a dedicated and competent engineer who has made significant 
contributions to the engineering department.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit D). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent's citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the 
person(s) involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to 
place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security 
clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct 
and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was a dual citizen of India and the United States who possessed an Indian passport.  Since learning that possession of a foreign passport is not 
permitted when holding a security clearance, in compliance with the provisions of the Money Memorandum, he surrendered his foreign passport to the Indian 
Consulate.  He also understands that by taking the oath of allegiance to the United States, under Indian Law, he has renounced his Indian citizenship.  Under the 
circumstances, the Applicant has done everything possible to be in compliance with the requirements of the directive and the Money Memorandum.  
Accordingly, he has clearly demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find for the Applicant under 
Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Although the Applicant's spouse is still an Indian citizen, 
she is in the process of applying for her United States citizenship.  She and the Applicant have a son who is a native born American.  Furthermore, the 
Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives are not of a nature to influence his security worthiness.  There is no evidence in the record that any of his family 
members any longer have any connection with the Indian Government, or are in a position to be exploited by the Indian Government in a way that could force 
the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the United States.  In regard to his one foreign asset, specifically the apartment in India he 
purchased for his parents to live in, its value is approximately $27,000.00 which is a mere pittance in comparison to the $800,000.00 in assets that he has in the 
United States.  Based on the foregoing, this does not raise a security concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline C and Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C and B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
