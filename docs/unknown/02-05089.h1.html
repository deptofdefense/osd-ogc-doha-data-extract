<P>Applicant--a 33-year-old married woman who left Ukraine for a better life in the U.S. in 1981 at age 23, and became a U.S. citizen in 2000--was not subject to 
foreign influence, notwithstanding her ties to Ukraine via sending money and family members, where Applicant's commitment and ties to the U.S. are so 
substantial that she can be expected to resist and report any potential foreign influence or pressure. Interim security clearance granted in September 2000 on 
essentially the same facts re-affirmed. Clearance granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 28 February 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 12 
arch 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 31 March 2003, and received and set by me the same day. 
On 2 April 2003, I issued a Notice of Hearing for a hearing on 1 May 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented one exhibit--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented five exhibits--admitted without 
objection--and the testimony of seven witnesses, including herself. DOHA received the transcript on 12 May 2003.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take official notice of the U.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet for Ukraine, and the 1999 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Ukraine. I granted the motion (Tr. 18-19).</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 33-year-old senior principal engineer of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information she has held on an interim basis 
since September 2000.</SPAN> She testified during the hearing, and I accept her testimony as credible and true<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in 1969 in Simferopol, Ukraine, then part of the U.S.S.R. She grew up there and completed her secondary education there in 1986, finishing 
atop her class. She speaks fluent English, having studied it since age six. She took and passed entrance examinations into her hometown university, where she 
studied applied mathematics. While in university, she came to the northwest United States as an exchange student<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> from August-December 1990 and fell in 
love with the U.S. After her return to Ukraine, she realized how little opportunity there was for her in the former Soviet republic, and how great the 
opportunities in the U.S. However, she went on to obtain the equivalent of a master's degree in mathematics (with honors) in June 1991. Still, she wondered 
how she might come to the U.S. to live.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her opportunity came in Spring 1992, while pursuing post-graduate work at her hometown university. Two visiting mathematics professors from a major U.S. 
university in the southeast U.S. came to her university to establish an exchange program. Applicant was called in to serve as their translator. Fluent in English 
and possessed of the mathematics skill to facilitate the professors' mathematics discussions with their Ukranian colleagues, Applicant so impressed the 
professors that they asked her to come to their university as a visiting scholar. They helped her obtain a visiting scholar (6-month, non-resident, J-1) visa to 
come to the U.S. in April 1993. She came with $50.00 and two suitcases containing all her worldly possessions--mostly clothes she described as so ridiculous 
looking she did not wear them. She never returned to Ukraine. Indeed, she has not left the United States and possesses no valid passport, either U.S. or foreign. 
She has no intention of returning to Ukraine because she considers it politically and environmentally dirty.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Shortly after she arrived in the U.S., she made a mathematics presentation to the members of the department  that so impressed them that the university 
presented her with the opportunity to enter their doctoral program in mathematics--which she did--and the university helped her obtain a foreign student (F-1) 
visa. While in the doctoral program, she worked as a graduate assistant, teaching mathematics courses. In March 1995, she met a friend of one of the math 
department's graduate students. He was four years older than Applicant and had begun college (his father was a micro-biology professor in the university's 
veterinary school), but had dropped out of the university to pursue other interests. They began dating, fell in love, and married in March 1996. Her academic 
accomplishments inspired him to return to school himself in September 1996. She obtained her doctorate in mathematics in March 1999. Because her husband 
still had a year to go before he completed his degree requirements, Applicant entered the university's aerospace engineering program and obtained her master's 
in aerospace engineering in August 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant married her husband in March 1996, she applied for legal permanent resident status--which she obtained--and U.S. citizenship as soon as she 
was able, January 2000. She became a U.S. citizen in June 2000. She described with palpable joy the thrill of becoming a U.S. citizen and having the 
opportunity to live her life the way she wanted it to be. She has no desire to return to Ukraine, even to see her parents. Her Soviet passport (issued in August 
1990), which she used to travel to the U.S. in August 1990 and August 1993, expired in July 1995 and has not been renewed.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After Applicant received her master's in aerospace engineering, she received a job offer from her current employer and moved to the northern part of the state 
to begin work. Her job requires a security clearance and she applied for her clearance in August 2000, almost immediately after starting work. She received her 
interim clearance on 1 September 2000, and has been working with classified information without incident since then. She enjoys the work that her education 
makes her particularly well-qualified for.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant's husband completed his degree in computer science, rejoined his wife, and obtained employment himself, they began to feel more settled in 
their new location. They bought a home in March 2001. They decided to begin a family; their son was born in October 2002. They got another dog.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother, father, and grandmother are Ukranian citizens, residing in Ukraine. Her mother and father have been to the U.S. for an extended visit in 
2002. Applicant reported their coming visit to the company and to the DSS agent who interviewed her in January 2002. They would like to emigrate to the U.S., 
but cannot do so while the grandmother--too old and ill to emigrate herself--remains alive. Applicant's father is a retired factory worker and part-time 
independent automobile mechanic, who has never had any connection to the Soviet or Ukrainian governments which have controlled his homeland during his 
lifetime. Applicant's mother was a sewing worker in a factory who eventually obtained her undergraduate education in night school and became a clothing 
warehouse distributor. She is now retired, but has never had any connection with the Soviet or Ukranian governments which have controlled her  homeland 
during her lifetime. Their retirement income is $20.00 per month, enough to cover the cost of their apartment. Applicant and her husband contribute financially 
to her parents support, taking bi-monthly turns with Applicant's sister and her husband of providing approximately $250.00 per month ($1,500.00 per year). 
She has regular contact with her parents, sending them letters and packages with pictures of their grandson. They talk on the telephone.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1993, Applicant's younger sister married a naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom--a native-born Iranian who emigrated to the U.K. when he was 
15 or 16 years old for religious reasons.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> They met in Ukraine where she was at the same hometown university Applicant attended and he was trying to start a 
business, which ultimately failed, in part because he would not bribe the Ukrainian officials necessary to make the business succeed. In 1994, they returned to 
the U.K. where he now runs a flooring company in West Sussex, England. She became a naturalized citizen of the U.K. in 1997. She and her husband have an 
8-year-old daughter, born in the U.K. She has been to visit Applicant in the U.S. in 1996 and 1999. She and Applicant have regular contact as well.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no financial or other interests in Ukraine, no connection to the Soviet or Ukrainian government, no contacts with Ukrainian citizens other that her 
parents and grandmother. Her financial interests, her personal interests, and her emotional commitments are all in the U.S. She and her husband have an 
excellent credit history (A.E. A, D). They pay taxes to the IRS (A.E. B). She described with visible joy the elation of her wedding day, the day of her 
naturalization as a U.S. citizen, the birth of her child. Several of her witnesses described her joy at becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knows to report to her company and the FBI  any efforts to coerce classified information from her(Tr. 43). In response to Department Counsel's 
cross-examination about her concerns for her parents in Ukraine, Applicant expressed an unequivocal unwillingness to disclose classified information:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I would never even  think about compromising classified information. And this is a question I answered to myself long before I ever had a job that had any kind 
of sensitivity like that. Because in my opinion, if I cooperate with people like that, I will hurt a lot more people [sic] if  I don't cooperate with people like that.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have a lot in stake in this country. I have a son that I love. I have a husband that I love. And you know if someone threatens to hurt my parents, they are going 
to hurt them regardless. . .(Tr. 48-49).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character witnesses<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> consider her a truthful, straightforward person, who has excelled as a student, instructor, employee, and mother; who has 
handled classified information carefully; who has unswerving loyalty to her adopted country; and who has sufficient strength of character to resist and report 
any efforts by the Ukrainian government to pressure her. I find these witnesses observations of Applicant's truthfulness, candor, and love of the U.S. credible, 
as well as comporting with my own observations of Applicant</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ukraine--a former Soviet Republic--is governed by a directly elected president and unicameral parliament; outside observers essentially agree that all election 
results since 1994 reflect the will of the electorate. Nevertheless, Ukraine has a less-than-satisfactory human rights record, although progress is being made.  
The country is undergoing profound political and economic change as it moves towards a market economy and integrates into Western institutions. There is 
wide-spread corruption in the government and the economy. However, the private sector continues to grow and now represents a substantial portion of the 
economy. Still, the transition from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy has been difficult.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is substantial crime in the population. Unemployment affects women disproportionally and violence against women is a pervasive problem. Political 
opposition is pressured through judicial and extra-judicial means. However, the government of Ukraine is not otherwise hostile to the U.S. Indeed, the U.S. 
provides substantial foreign aid to Ukraine, including support for transition to market economy, civil reform, and democratic reform. There are nearly 49 
million residents in Ukraine.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of  affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries, or financial interests in 
other countries, are also relevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Common sense suggests that the 
stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under 
control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the above concerns, the foreign country at issue is Ukraine, a former republic of the Soviet Union experiencing a difficult transition to a market 
economy and democratic government. Of course, in every security clearance case an applicant's ties or connections to any foreign country deserve careful 
examination.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Common sense suggests that such connections do not deserve the same level of scrutiny, however, as a foreign country whose interests are 
hostile or inimical to the U.S., or a foreign country with an authoritarian or totalitarian government. Accordingly, I have reviewed Applicant's ties or 
connections to Ukraine additional scrutiny.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B, by demonstrating that Applicant's parents and grandmother are citizens and residents of Ukraine. 
However, the fact that Applicant's brother-in-law is a native-born Iranian, naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom, residing there, lacks security significance. 
The fact that he was born in Iran lacks significance where he was born when the Shah of Iran--an ally of the U.S.--governed Iran, but fled with his family 
when the Islamic fundamentalist government began persecuting Baha'is, a religious sect tolerated under the westernized government of the Shah. The fact that 
he is now a naturalized citizen of the U.K., as is Applicant's only sister and sibling, also lacks security significance, despite the fact that Applicant's contacts 
with her sister are not casual and infrequent. However, the record evidence clearly indicates that neither her sister nor husband are agents of a foreign power, 
nor are they in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Common sense demonstrates there is nothing in the record to suggest that their relationship with 
Applicant is such that Applicant would be forced to chose between her duty to her sister and her duty to the U.S. Having concluded that the government has not 
established its case regarding the sister and husband residing in the U.K.,  I resolve those Guideline B allegations for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reach the same conclusion regarding Applicant's immediate family residing in Ukraine, albeit for different reasons.</SPAN> Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> applies 
given that Applicant has close relationships with immediate family members who are citizens of, or residents in, Ukraine, and she believes she has a duty or 
obligation to her parents.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, DC 6<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> applies based on her sending money to her parents. The money has some potential to make Applicant vulnerable 
to foreign influence. That action, coupled with Applicant's family members in Ukraine, raise security concerns due to the potential for foreign influence.<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The 
remaining disqualifying conditions of Guideline B do not apply given the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nevertheless, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. </SPAN>Applicant's immediate family members were not employed by or connected with the 
Ukrainian military, law enforcement, or a governmental agency during their working life, and they are now retired living on a minimal pension. They were not 
and are not involved in political, scientific, commercial, or other activities where they might benefit from obtaining U.S. national security information. Given 
the record evidence, I conclude Applicant's immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power, and under these circumstances, mitigating condition 
(MC) 1<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies in Applicant's favor. MC 4<A HREF="02-05089.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> also applies as Applicant reported to her company the pending visits of her parents and sister, and to the DSS 
agent who interviewed her in January 2002. The remaining mitigating conditions of Guideline B do not apply given the record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Although MC 1 is the only applicable mitigating condition, the analysis does not necessarily end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security 
concerns. First, Applicant's commitment to the U.S. is extraordinarily high. She literally bounced with joy on the stand describing how she felt the day she 
became a citizen. She left a country that offered her limited prospects for a possibility of becoming an American citizen in a country that offers nearly limitless 
prospects. She committed whole-heartedly to her new country, even before becoming a citizen. Second, Applicant's ties or connections to the U.S. are 
substantial. Since her arrival here in 1993, Applicant can fairly be described as a model immigrant. She obtained her doctoral degree, married, obtained a 
second master's after encouraging her husband to go back to school to get his degree.  Applicant and her husband started a family. Moreover, her husband , 
child, professional career, and financial interests are in the U.S., and that situation is unlikely to change. Indeed, she has not gone back to Ukraine and has no 
intention of ever going back, and has not left the U.S. since arriving in 1993. These are examples of ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy 
such as the U.S. Applicant and her witnesses testified credibly that she has an excellent history of safe handling of classified information and is unlikely to ever 
be pressured to disclose it to unauthorized persons. Accordingly, based on the record as a whole, I conclude Applicant is a self-reliant, responsible, and 
trustworthy individual. It is my predictive judgment, also based on the record as a whole, that Applicant has the necessary strength of character so that he can be 
expected to resist and report any potential foreign influence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was previously granted an interim clearance on essentially the same facts as here, but that does not preclude the government from re-examining 
Applicant's eligibility for continued access to classified information or from revoking the clearance if the re-investigation reveals either new concerns or 
increased concerns. Still, revocation of a clearance where there has been little significant change in an applicant's circumstances should not be undertaken 
lightly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, the government invokes only one disqualifying condition in its closing argument--family members residing overseas, which suggests that the government 
is satisfied that Applicant's financial support to her parents does not</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">constitute "conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure by a foreign government."  While, Applicant's ties to her parents and grandmother are clear, her parents are 60 years old and hr grandmother is 83 and 
in ill health, making their contacts benign. Her parents plan to emigrate to the U.S. when they are able. They are not employed by the government nor are they 
agents of the government. None are employed in positions that make them susceptible to pressure by the government.</SPAN> After weighing the record evidence, the

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996, and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Entering the U.S. on a non-immigrant J-1 visa issued for six months beginning 17 August 1990 (Tr. 20). 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant produced the original passport as an exhibit at the hearing. Among other things, it corroborates Applicant's claimed U.S. visa history, including her 
legal permanent resident status. However, because I considered the now-expired passport an important legal record of her travel and visa history, I did not admit 
the passport into the record, but recorded the pertinent information into the transcript (Tr. 20-21). 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>His family was Baha'i, a religious minority in Iran, that became increasingly persecuted by the Islamic fundamentalist government which came into power in 
Iran after the fall of the Shah in 1979. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>A math department professor from Applicant's doctoral program, who has previously held a clearance; an aeronautical engineering graduate student who had 
Applicant as an instructor; the aeronautical engineering professor who served as her advisor and mentor during her master's program; the company division 
head who hired her and supervises her (who has a current clearance); a co-worker who has worked closely with Applicant on several classified projects; and her 
husband. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A> <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 97-0699 (November 24, 1998), p. 3. Nothing in Guidelines B or C "requires that the foreign country in question have interests that are 
inimical to the interests of the United States." 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>I note that the United Kingdom is a free society whose democratic institutions are similar to our own, long preceded our own, and indeed form the basis for 
our own. While the U.S. does not share a unity of interests with the U.K., both governments have long acknowledged the special relationship between the two 
countries. The U.K. is neither a totalitarian regime, nor a regime known to engage in human rights violations, nor a known sponsor of state terrorism. Thus, it is 
extremely unlikely that the U.K. government would target Applicant's family to extract information from Applicant. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant's 
family in the U.K. is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family and the 
U.S., based on all available evidence.
