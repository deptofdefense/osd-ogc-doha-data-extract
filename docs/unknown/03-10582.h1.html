<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a contract librarian </P> 
<P>who petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1995 because of extensive debts. The bankruptcy was discharged later the same year. Since the bankruptcy, 
Applicant has incurred over $18,000.00 in delinquent debts ranging in amount from $73 to over $4,000. In 2003, Applicant again petitioned for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy and it was discharged in June, 2004. She helps to support several family members who are employed and could, but do not, contribute to the 
household expenses. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 4, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On March 1, 2004, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned 
to me on May 12, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on June 15, 2004, and a hearing was held on June 23, 2004. The Applicant waived the 15-day notice 
requirement and testified. The Government introduced 14 exhibits and the Applicant introduced two exhibits. All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The 
transcript was received on July 9, 2004. Two post-hearing exhibit were introduced by the Applicant on September 1 and 10, 2004 without objection by the 
government<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a contract librarian. She admitted all but one of the specific allegations in the SOR. She 
disagreed with all of the conclusions reached in the SOR based on the allegations. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due 
consideration of the record, the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant left her employment in another state in 1992 to move with her two children to be near her family. She had difficulty finding employment and shared a 
house with another woman and her child. Applicant took responsibility for the house-mate's child when the she was sentenced to prison on a drug charge. 
Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1995 because of extensive debts. The bankruptcy was discharged later the same year Since the bankruptcy, 
Applicant had further financial difficulties and incurred over $18,000.00 in delinquent debts ranging in amount from $73 to over $4,000 cited in the SOR. Some 
of the debts resulted in judgments against Applicant. Several of the cited debts in the SOR had either been paid or discharged in the 1995 bankruptcy. </P> 
<P>In 2003, Applicant again petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy which was discharged in June 2004, several days prior to the hearing in this matter. That 
bankruptcy proceeding discharged other debts cited in the SOR. </P> 
<P>Applicant's monthly take home pay is $1,700.00 of which $700 is paid for rent, $800 for food, clothing, and medical. Applicant has two children ages 21 and 6 
who live with her and the father of the younger child. He contributes to the household expenses when he is employed. Her older child is employed but does not 
contribute to the household expenses and Applicant pays  auto insurance for her. Applicant has also taken into her household a nephew and his daughter who 
are both employed but contribute nothing to the household expenses. Her income is barely adequate to pay household and living expenses. </P> 
<P>Several of Applicant's family members have worked on the installation where she is employed and she takes pride in that fact. Her brother is a sergeant in the 
Army who has just returned from Iraq.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's extensive delinquent debts prompted the allegations under Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting 
financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) include the fact that 
the</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). Petitioning for a second bankruptcy does not 
mitigate the allegations in the SOR. Discharge in bankruptcy gives a fresh start but does not relieve the Applicant of responsibility for insuring sound financial 
practices in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not shown the proper response for resolution of her financial obligations. Having once undertaken bankruptcy for good reason, she was obliged to 
fulfill her financial responsibilities thereafter. She failed to do so and has again petitioned for bankruptcy a second time. While there were some circumstances 
that occurred which were beyond her control between the first and second bankruptcies, Applicant has failed to take adequate remedial steps to insure that 
similar problems might not arise in the future.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her salary is inadequate to provide sufficient assets to pay her costs of living and this has been the principal cause of extensive indebtedness. While her 
willingness to help relatives and friends who live in her home is commendable from a social standpoint, it has not served her well in providing sufficient 
financial assets to pay her debts. Although the second bankruptcy has apparently taken care of many of the debts cited in the SOR, the fact that she has taken 
bankruptcy, not just once but twice in the last ten years, militates against the grant of a security clearance. Some of the circumstances that led to the 
bankruptcies no longer exist but the totality of Applicant's adverse financial situation continues and shows few signs of improvement. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted to the Applicant to show that Mitigating Conditions (MC) are applicable. She has failed to meet the burden of proof 
requirement to mitigate the allegations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis. While Applicant is a well-meaning person who has taken care of friends and family, the requirements in security clearance proceedings for 
good fiscal management precludes the grant of a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that Applicant has not been 
successful in resolving her financial difficulties and it is premature to grant her a clearance.</SPAN></P>
