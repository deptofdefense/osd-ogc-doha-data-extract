  Decisions by a Hearing Office Administrative Judge are not legally binding precedent on another Hearing Office Judge or the Board.  Statutory construction is not based on interpreting or construing single words or brief phrases in a statute in the abstract.   Congress has provided some guidance for construing federal statutes in 1  U.S.C. 1 that is pertinent to construing 10 U.S.C. 986.  Nothing in 10 U.S.C. 986 indicates or suggests that Congress intended its application to turn on whether there  was a single crime or multiple crimes covered by a given conviction, or whether there was a single term or multiple terms of imprisonment imposed in connection with a  given conviction.  The Judge did not err by applying 10 U.S.C. 986 because Applicant's consecutive sentences of imprisonment were imposed in connection with a given  conviction, and the practical effect of the imposition of consecutive sentences resulted in Applicant being sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.   Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 23, 2003 which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Joan Caton 
Anthony issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated April 19, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 despite the fact that 
Applicant was sentenced to three one-year sentences, to run consecutively, instead of being sentenced to a single term of imprisonment exceeding one year.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 despite the fact that Applicant was sentenced to three one-year 
sentences, to run consecutively, instead of being sentenced to a single term of imprisonment exceeding one year</SPAN>.  On appeal, there is no challenge to the Administrative 
Judge's findings that: (a) Applicant had sexual relations with his 15-year-old stepdaughter over a three-year period, beginning in 1979; (b) Applicant had sexual contact 
with his younger stepdaughter on one occasion during that period; (c) Applicant was indicted on one felony count of statutory rape and three counts of sodomy, all the 
counts arising from his sexual conduct with his stepdaughters; (d) Applicant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was 
sentenced to 90 days of confinement; (e) Applicant was convicted later of one misdemeanor count of indecent exposure and two counts of misdemeanor sexual battery; 
(f) Applicant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment on each of the counts, the sentences to run consecutively; (g) the court suspended execution of imprisonment and 
placed Applicant on supervised probation for four years; and (h) Applicant successfully completed probation and has not been charged with any other crime or off-duty 
misconduct since then.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, which provides that the Department of Defense may not grant or renew a security 
clearance for a defense contractor official or employee that falls under any of four statutory categories [10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) through (c)(4)].  The Judge concluded that 
Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1), which  reads: "The person has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge's conclusion that his case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  In support of that 
challenge, Applicant argues the following:</P> 
 
<P>(1) 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) refers to "a crime" and "a term," both of which are singular in nature, not plural, and therefore 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) does not apply to 
Applicant because the state court imposed on him three, consecutive, 12-month sentences for three separate crimes, not a single term of imprisonment exceeding one 
year;</P> 
 
<P>(2) courts have a variety of reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, rather than concurrent sentences, some of which do not imply anything about the seriousness of 
the crimes involved or about the defendant;</P> 
 
<P>(3) in enacting 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, Congress was concerned about convicted felons being granted security clearances, and that concern does not extend to persons 
convicted only of misdemeanors;</P> 
 
<P>(4) 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) should be interpreted and construed in light of the definition of "felony offense" set forth under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3559, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3581, and 
&sect;4A1.2 of the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual;</P> 
 
<P>(5) the two decisions by DOHA Hearing Office Administrative Judges relied on by Department Counsel in support of its argument that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to 
Applicant's case are not legally binding precedent and should not be considered persuasive authority;</P> 
 
<P>(6) the decision in <EM>United States v. Brown</EM>, 333 U.S. 18 (1948), relied on by Department Counsel in support of its argument that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to Applicant's 
case, is distinguishable and does not support the Administrative Judge's conclusion about the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986; and</P> 
 
<P>(7) a decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, relied on by Department Counsel in support of its argument that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to Applicant's case, is 
distinguishable and does not support the Administrative Judge's conclusion about the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant's appeal raises a serious, novel legal issue, Department Counsel elected to not file a reply brief.</P> 
 
<P>As a preliminary matter, Applicant correctly notes that his appeal raises a question of law that the Board has not previously addressed.  Because this appeal involves a 
question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary and <EM>de novo</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's last three arguments can be disposed of quickly.  The Administrative Judge in this case correctly noted that the two decisions by Hearing Office Judges cited 
by Department Counsel during the proceedings below were not legally binding on her.  Furthermore, the Board does not rely on them to reach its decision in this case.<A HREF="02-21060.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  
oreover, the Board concludes the decisions in <EM>United States v. Brown</EM>, 333 U.S. 18 (1948) (involving the imposition of a sentence under the Federal Escape Act) and 
<EM>Spoto v. Colorado State Department of Corrections</EM>, 883 P.2d 11 (Colo. 1994)(involving parole eligibility under Colorado law) are distinguishable and not particularly 
helpful in deciding this appeal.  The Board will now turn to Applicant's remaining arguments.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes that "a crime" and "a term" are singular, not plural, in nature.  However, that observation does not have the significance Applicant places on it 
because statutory construction is not based on interpreting or construing single words or brief phrases in the abstract.  According to the Supreme Court:</P> 
 
<P>"Over and over we have stressed that '[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the 
whole law, and to its object and policy.'  No more than isolated words or sentences is punctuation alone a reliable guide for discovery of a statute's meaning.  Statutory 
construction 'is a holistic endeavor,' and, at a minimum, must account for a statute's full text, language as well as punctuation, structure, and subject matter." <EM>United 
States National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc</EM>., 508 U.S. 439, 455 (1993)(citations omitted)</P> 
 
<P>Moreover, in 1 U.S.C. &sect;1, Congress has provided some guidance for construing federal statutes that is pertinent to the construction and interpretation of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  
The following language from 1 U.S.C. &sect;1 is pertinent to this appeal:</P> 
 
<P>"In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise -</P> 
 
<P>words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things; </P> 
 
<P>words importing the plural include the singular; . . . ."</P> 
 
<P>Nothing in 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 indicates or suggests that Congress intended its application to turn on whether there was a single crime or multiple crimes covered by a given 
conviction, or whether there was a single term or multiple terms of imprisonment imposed in connection with a given conviction.<A HREF="02-21060.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In this case, Applicant's consecutive 
sentences of imprisonment were imposed in connection with a given conviction, and the practical effect of the imposition of consecutive sentences resulted in Applicant 
being sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.</P> 
 
<P>The reasons why courts decide to sentence a defendant to concurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonment are irrelevant.  Nothing in 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 indicates or 
suggests that the reasons why a court imposes a particular sentence are relevant to its application.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes that (a) there is very little legislative history concerning the enactment of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986,<A HREF="02-21060.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and (b) Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 after 
publication of a newspaper article entitled "How Felons Gain Access to the Nation's Secrets."  However, the paucity of legislative history does not warrant relying on a 
newspaper article to discern Congressional intent, especially when the article was published before any legislation was introduced or enacted.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's reliance on the statutory definition of a federal felony is misplaced.  Congress did not enact 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 with any language referring to a statutory 
definition of "felony."  Nor did Congress use the words "felon" or "felony" in 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  If Congress had wanted to distinguish between felony convictions and 
misdemeanor convictions, then Congress easily could have done so by wording 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 differently.  The application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 does not turn on whether 
an applicant's conviction is labeled or characterized as a "misdemeanor" or a "felony."</P> 
 
<P>For all the foregoing reasons, taken cumulatively, the Board concludes the Administrative Judge did not err by deciding Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  
Accordingly, Applicant's conviction falls within the scope of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  Because the Judge correctly held that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to Applicant's case, it was 
not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that application of that statute precluded a favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred by applying 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to his case.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Judge's unfavorable security 
clearance decision.</P>
