  Given the language of Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.12, it was improper for Department Counsel to argue that Applicant's request for a closed hearing was evidence that he was vulnerable to coercion or blackmail.  The Administrative Judge's  finding that Applicant was vulnerable to coercion or blackmail is sustainable in light of the record evidence.  The Board need not decide an  appeal issue that is not material to a resolution of the case.  The Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance is sustainable in  light of the record evidence.  Applicant is not entitled to have the case remanded so that he can have another opportunity to present his case.   Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 14, 2003, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline D 
(Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro issued an unfavorable security clearance 
decision, dated August 23, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under 
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred when he failed to instruct Applicant that a 
request for a closed hearing could be used by Department Counsel to argue that Applicant was vulnerable to blackmail or coercion; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant was vulnerable to blackmail or coercion was supported by substantial record 
evidence; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that there was evidence indicating that rape charges brought against 
Applicant in 1988 were <EM>nolle prossed</EM> in contemplation that the victim would subsequently pursue a civil suit against Applicant for child 
support; (4) whether the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 3; (5) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant engaged in deliberate falsification when answering questions on a March 2001 
security clearance application; (6) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3 did not 
apply to the case; (7) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Department Counsel met its burden of proof by establishing 
Applicant's ineligibility for access to classified information; and (8) whether the case should be remanded to allow Applicant an opportunity 
to submit additional evidence.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred when he failed to instruct Applicant that a request for a closed hearing could be used by 
Department Counsel to argue that Applicant was vulnerable  to blackmail or coercion</SPAN>.  Applicant notes that, in closing argument, Department 
Counsel asserted that his decision to request a closed hearing was evidence that Applicant was vulnerable to blackmail or coercion.  Applicant 
asserts that the Administrative Judge should have warned him that a request for a closed hearing could result in the type of argument made by 
Department Counsel in this case.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's comment in closing argument about Applicant's choice of a closed hearing was improper.  The right to choose a closed 
hearing is one expressly granted to applicants under the Directive.<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel's argument that Applicant's decision to ask for a 
closed hearing showed he was still vulnerable to blackmail or coercion is in direct contravention of the last sentence of Item E3.1.12 of the 
Directive, which states, "No inference shall be drawn as to the merits of a case on the basis of a request that the hearing be closed."</P> 
 
<P>As a practical matter, an Administrative Judge cannot be expected to anticipate the arguments of the parties beforehand.  Accordingly, the 
Judge was not duty bound to inform Applicant as to the possibility that Department Counsel might make an argument about Applicant's 
decision to ask for a closed hearing.  And, in any event, there is no indication that Applicant was prejudiced by Department Counsel's 
argument.  Nothing in the decision below indicates that the Judge was  influenced by Department Counsel's improper argument.  There is no 
presumption of error below and Administrative Judges are presumed to know the law.  After reviewing the Judge's decision and the record in 
this case, the Board is satisfied that Applicant's choice of a closed hearing had no bearing on the findings and conclusions reached by the 
Judge in this case.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant was vulnerable to blackmail or coercion was supported by substantial 
evidence</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant was charged with rape and statutory burglary (the burglary was related to the rape) 
in 1990.  He also found that Applicant's family is unaware of the charges and that Applicant expressed a desire to keep them unaware of the 
charges.  Based on these findings, the Judge concluded that Disqualifying Condition 3<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of the Sexual Behavior Guideline (Guideline D) 
applied in the case.  On appeal, Applicant asserts that Department Counsel presented no substantial evidence establishing that he was 
reasonably subject to blackmail or coercion.  After a review of the Judge's decision and the record in this case, the Board concludes that the 
Judge's findings and conclusions with regard to Applicant's vulnerability to coercion or blackmail are sustainable.  None of the facts cited by 
Applicant on appeal establish error on the part of the Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that there was evidence indicating that rape charges brought against Applicant in 
1988 were <EM>nolle prossed</EM> in contemplation that the victim would subsequently pursue a civil suit against Applicant for child support</SPAN>.  In his 
findings of fact, the Administrative Judge noted that a 1988 rape charge against Applicant had been <EM>nolle prossed</EM>.  In his conclusions, the 
Administrative Judge noted that the record did not contain any explanation for the charge, but also noted that there was evidence that the 
disposition was done in contemplation that the victim would file a civil suit seeking child support.  Applicant argues that such a conclusion 
was error and that the Judge's reliance on a statement in a Naval Investigative Service Report did not establish a specific reason for the non-prosecution.</P> 
 
<P>The Board need not decide whether the Administrative Judge erred because the challenged finding is not material to the resolution of this 
case.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32 ("The Board shall address the <EM>material</EM> issues raised by the parties to 
determine whether harmful error occurred.")(italics added).</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 3</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge 
found that Applicant was charged with crimes of a sexual nature in 1988 and 1990 and concluded that these charges met applicable 
disqualifying conditions under the Sexual Behavior Guideline.  When discussing possible mitigation of the conduct, the Judge concluded that 
he could apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  However, the Judge decided to not apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 
1<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> because Applicant was not an adolescent at the time of the sexual misconduct, and decided to not apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating 
Condition 3<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> because subsequent to the 1988 and 1990 charges, Applicant was twice given nonjudicial punishment while in the military 
because of assaults committed against fellow sailors, was fined for driving on a revoked license in January 2000, and was charged with 
disorderly conduct in September 2001.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's arguments concerning the applicability of Sexual Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 3 are confusing and difficult to follow.  
To the extent Applicant appears to be arguing that the Administrative Judge should have applied Sexual Conduct Mitigating Condition 1, 
Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below because the Judge articulated a rational basis for concluding that Mitigating Condition 1 did 
not apply.  To the extent Applicant appears to be arguing the Judge should have applied Sexual Conduct Mitigating Condition 2, Applicant's 
argument is moot because the Judge expressly stated that Mitigating Condition 2 applied.  The Board need not decide what Applicant is 
arguing about with respect to Sexual Conduct Mitigating Condition 3, because -- even if the Board were to assume solely for purposes of 
deciding this appeal that Applicant's claim of error had merit -- it would not demonstrate harmful error.  The application of Sexual Conduct 
itigating Condition 3 would be irrelevant to the Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's vulnerability to coercion or blackmail, 
and irrelevant to the Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's falsification.</P> 
 
<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant engaged in deliberate falsification when answering questions on a 
arch 2001 security clearance application</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant asserts that his actions in completing his security clearance application should not result in his being considered a security risk.  On 
appeal, he offers numerous explanations for why a number of his arrests were not listed on the application, including: (i) he did not fully 
understand the questions on the application; (ii) he did not complete the application himself, but merely answered questions posed to him by 
his security manager, who completed the application; (iii) he did not consider himself a convicted felon; (iv) he knew the derogatory 
information was in the public record and could easily be discovered, therefore negating an intent to conceal; and (v) he was not thorough 
enough in his review of the application after completion.  Applicant asserts that the Appeal Board should find from a totality of the 
circumstances that there was no deliberate omission, concealment or falsification.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's last assertion, in essence, asks the Board to engage in <EM>de novo </EM>review, which it has no authority to do under the Directive.  Rather, 
in evaluating this claim of error, the Board need only determine whether the Administrative Judge's findings are supported by substantial 
record evidence and whether the Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The Judge's analysis of Applicant's falsification conduct reflects a plausible, reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant's 
statements about his state of mind and intent when he completed the security clearance application in March 2001 are relevant and material 
evidence that the Judge had to consider.  However, those statements were not binding on the Judge; rather, the Judge had to consider 
Applicant's statements in light of his assessment of his credibility and the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's ability to argue for an 
alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's findings of falsification are 
erroneous.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0435 (September 22, 2000) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also asserts that a 2000 driving on a revoked license violation for which he paid a fine of $50.00 should not be used as a basis to 
deny him his security clearance.  In support of this assertion he cites Question 26 of a security clearance application that Applicant completed 
in March 2001.  A portion of Question 26, quoted by Applicant, states, "Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.00 unless the violation was 
alcohol or drug related."  Applicant's failure to list the 2000 traffic violation for driving on a revoked license was not alleged in the SOR.  The 
Judge considered the traffic violation for purposes unrelated to his findings and conclusions about Applicant's falsification of the security 
clearance application.  The Judge's consideration of the traffic violation for purposes other than the falsification allegation was not arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>6. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3 did not apply to the case</SPAN>.  Applicant 
argues that he was forthcoming and acted promptly to correct the errors in his security clearance application and was truthful once he 
discovered that the answers to certain questions were incorrect.  Such an assertion raises the issue of the applicability of Personal Conduct 
itigating Condition 3.<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The mere making of this assertion, however, constitutes nothing more than Applicant's interpretation of the record 
evidence and fails to establish that the Judge erred by not applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.  Moreover, the Board concludes 
there is nothing in the record evidence that required the Judge to apply the mitigating condition.</P> 
 
<P>7. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Department Counsel met its burden of proof by establishing Applicant's 
ineligibility for access to classified information</SPAN>.  Near the end of his brief, Applicant states generally that Department Counsel failed to meet 
its burden of proof by substantial evidence that conditions in Applicant's personal or professional history disqualified him from being eligible 
for access to classified information.  Given the Administrative Judge's findings of fact, the Judge had a legally sufficient basis for concluding 
Department Counsel had met its burden of proof under the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>8. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the case should be remanded to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence</SPAN>.  Applicant requests, as an 
alternative to a reversal of the Judge's decision or a waiver recommendation,<A HREF="03-10959.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> that the case be remanded to allow Applicant an opportunity to 
present further proof of his reputation for honesty, truthfulness and reliability, his exercise of good judgment, favorable job performance, and 
his family's current state of knowledge regarding his past criminal history.  Applicant participated in a full hearing below, where he had a 
reasonable opportunity to present evidence bearing on the issue of his eligibility for a security clearance.  On appeal, he points to no 
procedural irregularities and offers no legal rationale as to why the case should be remanded to afford him a second chance to make his case.  
Accordingly, Applicant's request lacks merit.</P>
