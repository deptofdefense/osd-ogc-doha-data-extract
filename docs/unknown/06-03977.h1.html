<P>Applicant is not potentially subject to foreign influence through his parents and  siblings, who are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of China (PRC). He demonstrated that none of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 21 March 2006 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of unresolved 
foreign influence concerns.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-03977.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On 28 March 2006, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DOHA assigned the case to me 18 May 2006, and I convened a hearing 31 July 2006. 
DOHA received the transcript 9 August 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. He is a 39-year-old database engineer for a defense contractor, and seeks access to 
classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1966. He grew up in China, and was educated there, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1989. In 1990, he and his wife--also a 
PRC national--immigrated to the U.S. to pursue post-graduate education. He obtained his doctoral degree in June 1997.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2003. They have two children, both born in the U.S., and own their own 
home here. They have no intention of ever returning to the PRC to live.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC. His in-laws are also citizens of the PRC. However, his mother-in-law is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. and lives with 
Applicant and his wife, to be near her grandchildren.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is 65 years old, and has been a fisherman all his life. He never went to school--the fallout from a family misadventure in 1952 that branded Applicant's family an "anti-revolutionary" family in the early years of the communist regime.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's family is from a very small island off the coast of China--so small that the only means of transportation to the island was by ferry. His grandfather owned a small commercial fishing 
company there. When the communists came to power, he objected to their confiscation of personal property, and in 1952 tried to flee to Taiwan with his wife and son--then about 11. They were 
caught, Applicant's  grandfather was shot, and his grandmother and father were forced to return to the island. In addition to being denied an education, Applicant's father was never allowed to fish 
by himself after the escape attempt, and the family experienced other kinds of discrimination well into the 1970s. Although Applicant and his sister eventually obtained their educations, Applicant 
was encouraged by his parents to immigrate to the U.S. because he would never be treated completely fairly if he remained in the PRC.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is a life-long housewife. His brother is a fishmonger; his sister an accountant for a private construction company.  His in-laws were both middle school mathematics teachers, but 
they separated in approximately 2000, when she learned that he had had an affair. She decided to live with Applicant and his wife to be near her grandchildren. She has not been back to the PRC 
except to finalize her separation from her husband. Applicant has returned to the PRC twice, in 1999 and 2002, both times before he became a U.S. citizen. The latter trip was to see the home his 
parents were moving to. The island where he grew up was reachable only by ferry, and the population of the island had dropped so much over the years that the government discontinued the ferry 
service in 2002, requiring the residents to relocate. Since the 2002 visit, Applicant has had  little contact with his parents or siblings.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S., although it has cooperated with the U.S. in the global war on terrorism in recent years. It has an 
active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. intelligence and economic information, and operates against its citizens in the U.S. However, under PRC law, citizens who become naturalized 
citizens of other countries lose their PRC citizenship.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less 
than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="06-03977.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under Guideline B, by demonstrating that Applicant's parents and siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC.<A HREF="06-03977.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> However, Applicant mitigated the resulting 
security concerns. The allegations that Applicant's father-in-law is a  citizen and resident of the PRC (SOR 1.c.) and his mother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC and a legal permanent resident of the 
U.S. (SOR 1.d.) fail to raise a security concern under Guideline B, because they are not Applicant's immediate family members and the government's evidence fails to establish any close ties of 
affection or obligation to Applicant, particularly where his father-in-law is permanently separated from his mother-in-law. In similar fashion, Applicant's travel to the PRC in 1999 and 2002 (SOR 
1.e.) has no independent security significance under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's immediate family members are citizens and residents of the PRC, none are agents of the PRC, and none are in a position to be exploited by the PRC against Applicant.<A HREF="06-03977.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
Applicant's parents are elderly and have no connection to the government. His brother is a fishmonger, his sister is an accountant--again, neither has any connection to the government. Applicant 
has infrequent contact with his family members in the PRC. This limited contact presents an extremely narrow avenue of pressure a foreign government may exert on Applicant.<A HREF="06-03977.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Further, in more 
than 16 years in the U.S., Applicant has been back to the PRC only twice--for short visits. In addition, under the particular family history of Applicant's father, common sense suggests that 
Applicant is even less likely to be pressured, and his family less positioned to be pressured, than most. I conclude that there is little likelihood that Applicant could be pressured through his family in 
the PRC. He has met his burden of demonstrating that none of those family members are so situated as to present a point of influence. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline B for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
