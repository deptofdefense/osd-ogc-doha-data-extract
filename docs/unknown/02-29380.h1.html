<P>Applicant's falsification of his clearance application and financial irresponsibility renders him an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance 
denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 14 November 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or 
revocation of his clearance because of personal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal conduct.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR in December 2003 and 
requested a decision without hearing. He responded to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 24 March 2004. The record closed 14 May 
2004, the day Department Counsel indicated no objection to the response and the case was assigned to me 20 May 2004 to decide if clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted falsifying his clearance application<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and having had financial difficulties.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He denied that his falsification was criminal (3.a.). 
Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 41-year-old aviation mechanic for a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He previously had a clearance while employed by 
a different defense contractor from 1991 to 1996.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for his security clearance in February 2002, he failed to disclose a May 1997 arrest and conviction for DUI. When asked by 
investigators about this omission in June 2002, he denied any intent to mislead the Government, but acknowledged he omitted the arrest because he thought it 
had dropped off his record--implying he thought it would not be discovered by government investigators. His answer admits that he omitted the arrest because 
he thought it would disqualify him from getting a clearance. Applicant also omitted a February 1983 DUI arrest from his application. He was not asked about 
the arrest in June 2002 but his answer asserts that he simply forgot about it and so did not intend to mislead the Government. Department Counsel concedes that 
Applicant disclosed this arrest on his 1991 clearance application, thus obviating a falsification charge.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On his February 2002 clearance application, Applicant disclosed a September 1997 chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge which relieved him and his wife from over 
$83,000.00 in outstanding debt. Applicant had fallen behind on his payments after returning to the U.S. from a high-paying job overseas in December 1996.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
Between December 1996 and June 1997 (when he filed his chapter 7 petition), Applicant was unemployed for three months, relocated to take a job that 
disappeared after only one month, and relocated again for a job that lasted about 17 months before disappearing for economic reasons. Even after his chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge, Applicant experienced job instability, relocating four times for five different jobs of varying length, before relocating to his current 
position in November 2001. This job instability contributed to the five delinquent debts totaling about $2,900.00 alleged in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not disclose these delinquent debts on his clearance application. When he was asked about these debts in June 2002, he explained he was unaware 
of the debts and thought he had stayed current with his expenses since his bankruptcy. The Government accepted this explanation as no falsification was alleged 
in the SOR for this omission. However, during the June 2002 interview, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement showing he was paying $200.00 on 
the back rent balance (2.f.) that he now denies owing, and had the means to pay the other four delinquent accounts--which he promised to pay off by June 2003 
(12 months hence). However, he did not pay them off, or even reach a repayment agreement with the creditors, until after he received the SOR. Applicant's 
answer provided proof that he paid all $300.00 of past-due utility accounts (2.c., 2.d., 2.e.) in December 2003 and paid $600.00 (about half) of an unpaid 
furniture judgment (2.b.) the same month. He paid these debts by taking a loan against his retirement account. He claimed to be disputing the back rent debt, 
while also claiming payments that he did not corroborate.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant explained the delay in addressing these past-due debts as due to his mother's falling ill in fall 2002 and dying in January 2003, his wife's loss of work 
hours because of the declining economy, and their efforts to clean up other past due accounts so they could buy their home.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account </SPAN>both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fairly raised by the facts and 
circumstances presented. Each adjudicative decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline 
E (Personal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDENS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security 
clearance. The government must prove--by something less than a preponderance of the evidence--controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it 
establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one 
has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</P> 
 
<P>A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect 
national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under Guideline E and  J and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant believed he would not get his 
clearance if he disclosed his May 1997 DUI conviction, so deliberately omitted it from his February 2002 clearance application.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He believed the conviction 
had dropped from his record and would not be discovered by government investigators. He intended to mislead the government by this omission and his 
omission had the potential to affect the course of his background investigation. This conduct violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Although, he disclosed this conviction 
when questioned about arrests in June 2002, he had not volunteered the information before then and I infer he did so when asked because he deduced the agent 
may have uncovered the arrest. I conclude Guideline E and J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under Guideline F and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although the financial straits that led Applicant to 
file chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997--and contributed to a tight budget until January 2001--might reasonably be seen as beyond his control,<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant's 
response to his delinquent accounts after becoming aware of them in June 2002 bespeaks a financial irresponsibility inconsistent with access to classified 
information.<A HREF="02-29380.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> While I do not fault Applicant for turning his attention to his dying mother in late 2002, his answer implies that the expenses of her last illness 
and his wife's loss of work hours caused him some financial difficulty, and it was this financial difficulty, not the delinquent accounts he knew about since June 
2002, that he chose to address in order to take on more debt by buying his home. Not until he received the SOR was he spurred into action on his old debts, and 
even then he has substantiated only a portion of the steps he has taken to address the five debts. There is no evidence how Applicant intends to resolve the 
remaining half of the furniture judgment (2.b.) or the unpaid back rent (2.f.) whether paid or contested in court. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
