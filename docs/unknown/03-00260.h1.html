<P>This 26-year-old computer technician used and purchased marijuana, LSD, and Ecstacy between 1997 and April 2001.  He lied about his drug use on his 
January 2002 security clearance application (SF 86), thereby violating 10 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.  Mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>On May 13, 2004, Applicant submitted responses to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge 
on the written record, i.e, without a hearing.  A File of Relevant Materials (FORM) was issued on August 17, 2004, in which Applicant was advised to file any 
response within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Any such response was due by September 25, 2004, but no new submission was received by DOHA.  The 
matter was assigned to me on November 1, 2004. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 26-year-old computer technician for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains one allegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), 1.a.; one 
allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), 2.a.; and four allegations under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), 3.a., 3.b., 3.c., and 3.d.  Applicant admits all  
allegations in the SOR, with explanations.  The admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.</P> 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence found in the FORM, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
<P><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</EM></P> 
<P>1.a. - Applicant falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated January 3, 2002, when, in response to Question <STRONG>27 - "Your Use of 
Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity </STRONG>- Since age 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter," he listed his use of marijuana twice between February 1, 1998 
and February 27, 1998, but deliberately failed to disclose that he had used marijuana much more extensively, and had used other drugs within the previous 
seven years, as set forth below:</P> 
<P>(1) marijuana, with varying frequency, between 1997 and at least April 2001;</P> 
<P>(2) LSD, on at least 20 occasions, between 1998 and 2001;</P> 
<P>(3) Ecstacy, on about 15 occasions, between 1998 and at least April 2001.</P> 
<P><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</EM></P> 
<P>2.a. - the information set forth in SOR 1.a. above, constitutes a violation of Federal law, 10 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.</P> 
<P><EM>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</EM></P> 
<P>3.a. - the information set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a.(1), 1.a.(2), and 1.a.(3), above;</P> 
<P>3.b. - Applicant has purchased marijuana; </P> 
<P>3.c. - Applicant has purchased LSD; and </P> 
<P>3.d. - Applicant has purchased Ecstacy.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of 
the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  
otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  </P> 
<P>If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the 
Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Firstly, Applicant <EM>admits</EM> all allegations under all three Guidelines.  All of the SOR's allegations are also supported by the totality of the evidence in the record.  
Secondly, I conclude that the evidence does establish a nexus, or legal/logical connection, with his eligibility to hold a security clearance.  The sole remaining 
question is whether Applicant has adequately established mitigation or extenuation of the negative evidence against him.  For the reasons stated below, I 
conclude he did not do so.</P> 
<P>Since this matter is being decided on the written record and Applicant's last submission was his May 13, 2004 response to the SOR, the record evidence closed 
as of that date.  </P> 
<P><EM>1. Guideline E</EM>,</P> 
<P>Applicant's explanation for his falsifications on the SF 86 is as follows:</P> 
<P>I failed to provide the information on the security form due to the embarrassment with my family and friends and myself, as I previously provided to [the DoD 
investigator].</P> 
<P>I understand this language to mean that Applicant lied to avoid the embarrassment of having his friends and family find out about his drug use, and that he told 
the truth only when questioned by the DoD investigator.  Second only to an actual violation of the rules for protecting classified information or material, lying 
about material facts on a security clearance application <EM>or</EM> to an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) agent goes most directly to the heart of the 
industrial security program.  Simply put, someone who cannot be trusted to tell the truth in such cases cannot be trusted to protect the nation's secrets.   </P> 
<P>Applicant lied on his SF 86 about the extent of his drug use.  His statement is an explanation, but it does not come anywhere near being an acceptable excuse, 
since it indicates he placed his fear of embarrassment above the interests of his country, whether he was thinking about his conduct in this light or not.</P> 
<P>Disqualifying Condition (2) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of material and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire is clearly 
applicable.  At the same time, none of the possible mitigating conditions are established by the record. </P> 
<P><EM>2. Guideline J</EM></P> 
<P>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.   Intentional falsifications of material fact 
<EM>(such as denying drug use) </EM>are clearly the kind of false statement that violates 10 U.S.C. 1001.  I conclude that Applicant has committed a felony under Federal 
law and constitutes a "serious" crime under the Directive.  </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions 1 (any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and 2 (<EM>a single serious crime </EM>or multiple lesser 
offenses) are applicable.  In context, a falsification in a SF 86 signed in January 2002 is still recent, so Mitigating Condition 1 is not applicable.  The 
falsification was an isolated incident (MC 2).  Based on Applicant's  explanations, the record does not show clear evidence of successful rehabilitation as to  his 
falsification (MC 5).  </P> 
<P><EM>3. Guideline H </EM></P> 
<P>The improper or illegal involvement with drug raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  The rationale is 
that drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</P> 
<P>My decision is made on the evidence of record at the time the record closed, as reflected in the FORM.  Accepting Applicant's figures, he used marijuana from 
1997 to at least April 2001; LSD from 1998 to April 2001; and Ecstacy from 1998 to at least April 2001.  He also purchased the same  three drugs during the 
same periods.  Applicant states his last date of drug use as being April 2001, and claims a severance of ties with his drug-using friends, in favor of concentrating 
on his education and family.  He offers a list of educational accomplishments since 2001, leading to his receipt of a university B.S. in May 2003 and his 
acceptance into an MBA program at the same university (Item 3).</P> 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (1) any drug abuse and (2) illegal drug possession are applicable, but none of the possible mitigating conditions have been established 
by the record. </P> 
<P>Applicant is 26 years old (born in March 1979).  I Have considered the nature of his drug involvement, which began when he was about 19.  His last use 
occurred in April 2001, when he was 22 years old.  In ths context, I conclude the drug involvement is no longer recent (Mitigating Condition (MC) 1).  MC 2 is 
not applicable since the drug involvement was not an isolated or infrequent event.  In the context of his personal accomplishments and apparent lack of relapse.  
I conclude he has demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (MC 3).  Overall, I find for Applicant as to Guideline H.  </P> 
<P>In summary, even while accepting Applicant's statements as to his ending his drug involvement, his subsequent falsifications continue to raise question about 
his current judgment and reliability.  Under the Directive, Applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating his eligibility to hold a security clearance.  He has 
not adequately mitigated the negative aspects of his criminal falsifications under Guidelines E and J. </P>
