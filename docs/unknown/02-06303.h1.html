<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 January 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-06303.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 4 
February 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 25 March 2003 and I received and set the case the next 
day. I issued a Notice of Hearing on 27 March 2003 for a hearing on 30 April 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented five exhibits and the testimony of 
one witness, himself. DOHA received the transcript on 9 May 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>

<P>At the hearing, I gave the Applicant until the close of business on 9 May 2003 to provide a signed copy of Applicant's Exhibit D (A.E. D) for substitution into 
the record. On 7 May 2003, I received a memorandum from Department Counsel forwarding, without objection, the facsimile copy of the signed exhibit 
received on 6 May 2003. I have entered the substituted copy into the record as A.E. D.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the criminal allegations of the SOR, but denied falsifying his clearance application; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as 
findings of fact. Applicant also admits the applicability of </SPAN>10 U.S.C. &sect;986 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to this case, but requests a waiver.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In June 1995, Applicant--age 22--was a scholarship basketball player at a small university in his home state. He had just moved into a new apartment off-campus with a new roommate, also a scholarship basketball player. He began to notice that his roommate was acquiring expensive items that Applicant knew 
he could not afford to buy; when asked, the roommate admitted he was stealing the items from open garages and unlocked cars. Applicant did not turn his 
roommate in. He overlooked his roommate's continued thefts, occasionally drove his car to aid in the thefts, and  took a fishing pole and tool box from an open 
boat on another occasion. Applicant and his roommate traveled to Applicant's hometown in another part of the state during the summer. On their way home, 
Applicant discovered that his roommate had stolen some items while on the trip. Applicant did not turn around, but continued back to college.</P> 
 
<P>The jig was up in August 1995. The roommate was caught in the act, but fled the police, abandoning Applicant's car, that he had borrowed. The next day, 11 
August 1995, Applicant and his roommate were arrested and ultimately charged with multiple counts of first and second degree theft, third degree burglary, and 
unlawful breaking and entering of a motor vehicle (G.E. 3).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant cooperated in the police investigation, and in December 1995 pleaded guilty to first and second degree theft. He was sentenced to two years 
imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. He was ordered to serve 30 days beginning 1 June 1996; the balance of the sentence was suspended for two 
years conditioned on good behavior and payment attorneys fees, court costs, and nearly $4,800.00 restitution. Applicant satisfactorily completed the conditions 
of his suspended sentence.</P> 
 
<P>After sentencing, Applicant returned home for Christmas, and on 27 December 1995, was charged with breaking and entering a vehicle; these were not new 
charges, but were part of the summer crime spree. Applicant did not appear in court, but signed a number of documents. He was  later sentenced to three years 
in prison--suspended--and three years probation.</P> 
 
<P>As a result of his criminal conduct, Applicant lost his basketball scholarship and was suspended from school for a semester. However, he returned to school and 
obtained his undergraduate degree in biology. He married in August 1999. He began pursuing a master's degree that he will complete in summer 2003. He had 
no criminal involvement before the summer of 1995, and--with the exception of one incident discussed below--none after the summer of 1995.</P> 
 
<P>On 8 March 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(G.E. 1) on which he disclosed his 11 August 1995 felony arrest and subsequent 
conviction in response to question 21. He did not disclose the 27 December 1995 arrest in response to question 26 (other arrests). Nor did he disclose a 27 
August 1997 arrest for assaulting his girlfriend.<A HREF="02-06303.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant testified credibly that he did not list the December 1995 arrest because he considered it part and 
parcel of the 11 August 1995 arrest that he listed. He testified credibly that he did not remember the August 1997 arrest and knew that his felony arrest would 
be the biggest impediment to obtaining his clearance (Tr. 43-44).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's character witnesses--including the police chief from his home town--consider him an honest, trustworthy individual who has overcome his past 
problems and become a model employee (A.E. A-E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the hearing, Applicant took full responsibility for his past irresponsible and criminal conduct. He acknowledged that he knew better. His remorse was clear, 
as were the efforts he had made to turn his life around.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's 
fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the 
disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J, which cannot be mitigated under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986. The statute requires that I not renew Applicant's 
clearance because he was sentenced to two and three years imprisonment respectively on his 11 August 1995 arrest and 27 August 1995, notwithstanding that 
he served only thirty days on the first offense and none on the second, and completed his probations without incident. However, Applicant's criminal conduct 
was confined to a distinct period of time nearly eight years ago, has not been repeated, and was due in large part to the immaturity of the pampered--even in a 
small college--scholarship athlete. However, Applicant has clearly grown up after nearly ruining his life. I would consider his criminal conduct mitigated but 
for 10 U.S.C. &sect;986. Accordingly, I would grant Applicant's clearance were I free to do so under the existing disqualifying and mitigating factors.</P> 
 
<P>Unfortunately for Applicant, the law requires me to revoke his clearance. However, because I do so solely because of the requirements of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, I 
make the following statement as required under O.I. 64: <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established the fact of the two alleged omissions, but has not established its case under Guideline E because the omissions were not 
deliberate. He disclosed the felony arrest and conviction on 11 August 1995 and reasonably believed that the December 1995 charges were covered by the arrest 
he disclosed. He simply forgot the 1997 arrest, an arrest without independent security significance. Consequently, Applicant lacked the intent to mislead the 
government. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
