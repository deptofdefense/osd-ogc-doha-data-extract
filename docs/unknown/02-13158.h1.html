<P>By his own admission, the Applicant owes in excess of $8,000 in past due indebtedness to seven different creditors.  Included in these past due debts are two 
outstanding judgments.  As the Applicant has done little, if anything, to address this indebtedness, mitigation is not shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on September 15, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on October 29, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on November 19, 2003, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for 
resolution on January 29, 2004.  The issue raised here are whether the Applicant's current financial difficulties militate against the granting of a security 
clearance.  [The Applicant admits 10 of the 16 allegations; i.e., 1.a., 1.b., 1.e.~1.g., 1.j., 1.l., 1.m., 1.o. and 1.p.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 29 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant owes about $152 on an outstanding judgment that originally totaled $752 (Government Exhibit (GX) 3 at page 1 and GX 5 at page 3).  He 
paid about $600 towards this judgement through garnishments (GX 5 at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b., 1.e. and 1.g.  The Applicant owes about $1,708 on a second outstanding judgement (GX 3 at page 1 and GX 5 at page 3).  This judgment incorporated past 
due debts to a pizza parlor (subparagraph 1.e.), and attorney fees (subparagraph 1.g.) (GX 3 at page 1 ).  This outstanding judgement was entered against the 
Applicant in March of 2000, but the Applicant has done nothing to address this past due debt (GX 3 at page 1 and GX 5 at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant owes about $52 in past due indebtedness for emergency medical care (GX 3 at page 1, and GX 9 at page 9).  The Applicant claims this past 
due debt has been paid, but offers nothing in support of his averment (GX 3 at page 1).  According to his credit report of November 2001, it is still outstanding 
(GX 9 at page 9).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant owes about $33 in past due indebtedness for medical services rendered (GX 9 at page 9).  He claims this past due debt was paid through his 
health insurance, but offers nothing in support of his averment (GX 3 at page 1, and GX 5 at page 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant owes about $802 in past due indebtedness to a drinking water service (GX 3 at page 1, GX 5 at page 5, and GX 9 at page 10).  The 
Applicant has done nothing to address this past due debt (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h.  The Applicant owes about $138 in past due indebtedness to a utility company (GX 9 at page 8).  He denies this debt, but offers nothing in support of his 
averment (GX 3 at page 1, and GX 5 at pages 4~5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i.  The Applicant owed about $139 in past due indebtedness to a retailer (GX 9 at page 9).  He claims this debt has been paid, and his November 2001 credit 
report supports his averment (GX 3 at page 1, and GX 5 at page 9).  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.j.  The Applicant owes about $131 in past due indebtedness to a financial institution (GX 9 at page 11).  The Applicant has done nothing to address this past 
due debt (GX 3 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.k.  The Applicant owes about $973 in past due indebtedness to another financial institution (GX 9 at page 5).  He claims he only owes about $500 on this past 
due debt, but offers nothing in support of his averment (GX 3 at page 2, and GX 5 at page 4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l.  The Applicant owes about $918 in past due indebtedness to a third financial institution (GX 3 at page 2).  The Applicant has done nothing to address this 
past due debt (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.m.  The Applicant owes about $4,016 in past due indebtedness to a fourth financial institution (GX 3 at page 2).  The Applicant has done nothing to address 
this past due debt (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.n. and 1.o.  The Applicant owed about $300 in past due indebtedness to a fifth financial institution (GX 9 at page 9).  He claims this debt was discharged in 
November of 1998 by this Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (GX 3 at page 2).  His bankruptcy petition supports his averment (GX 8 at page 10).  These subparagraphs are 
found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.p.  The Applicant has a positive monthly cash flow of about $30 (GX 3 at page 2, and GX 5 at page 7).  This subparagraph is also found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in mitigation regarding his current financial situation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, by his own admission, has in excess of $8,000 in past due indebtedness.  There is additional past due indebtedness of about $700 which the 
Government has proven he also owes.  The Applicant, with a positive monthly cash flow of only about $30, has been unable to do anything to address his 
financial responsibilities.  Disqualifying conditions 1 and 3 are thus applicable in this case, as the Applicant has a "history of" and an "inability" to satisfy his 
past due debts.  His current financial difficulties are clearly of present security significance.  Guideline F is therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P>
