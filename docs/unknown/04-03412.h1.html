<P>Applicant mitigated one allegation of misuse of information technology concerning use of his defense contractor employer's computer to access sexually 
explicit materials on the internet in 2003. The offense resulted in his discharge after 13 years of employment. He is now employed by another defense 
contractor. He was under pressure caused by raising two children with a mentally ill wife from whom he divorced in 2005. Psychiatric testimony supported his 
defense and concluded that there was no evidence the conduct would be repeated and that he suffered from no psychiatric disability. Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 9, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On May 26, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on August 1, 2005. A notice of hearing 
was issued on September 27, 2005, and a hearing was held on November 18, 2005. Four government exhibits and five applicant exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. The Applicant and his doctor testified. The transcript was received on December 5, 2005.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant denied all of the specific SOR allegations. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since 2003. Before his present employment he worked for two other defense 
contractors for periods of  ten and 13 years respectively until he was terminated from his last employment for misuse of the company computer to access 
sexually explicit adult internet sites in violation of a company policy (Exh. 4). He held a security clearance the entire time of the earlier employments without 
any incidents. He held a clearance initially with his prior employer but, since he was working on unclassified matters, it had lapsed at the time of the incidents 
for which he was discharged. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's misuse of his company computer began in 2002 and increased to a point in January 2003, when he used it an hour or more a day to look at the 
internet sites. Occasionally, other members of the staff including his supervisor would watch with him leading him to think, erroneously, that the practice was 
not viewed very seriously by the company. The supervisor counseled him to be careful recognizing that it was against company policy. In March 2003, 
Applicant was visited by a staff member from human resources who advised him that he had been "watched" in some fashion and that a report would be made 
about his conduct. Nearly a month later he was called to the human resources office and terminated immediately and escorted from the facility. In addition to 
the allegation relating to misuse of the computer he was also told that there was an allegation of sexual harassment but that was not explained or elaborated on 
by the government. No documentation concerning the discharge and the reasons for it was offered in evidence. </P> 
<P>Applicant was unemployed during the summer of 2003 until his present employer made an offer and he accepted. He was advised that he would need a security 
clearance and an application for a security clearance (SF 86) was filed. He advised his new employer of the discharge and the reasons for it. He acknowledged 
the discharge in response to Question 31. He now is working on unclassified material. </P> 
<P>Applicant's 20-year marriage was difficult because  his wife suffered from a variety of mental problems including depression and bi-polar disorder aggravated 
by drug dependency. This was  particularly severe during the period 2000-2004. She was hospitalized in several facilities for extended periods of time which 
placed considerable strains on the family. It was during one of these periods that Applicant began to access the internet sites in an effort to take his mind off of 
his problems and help satisfy the physical isolation and lack of intimacy at home as a result of his wife's illness. He did not engage in accessing the sites at 
home around his family. When he was discharged by his former employer he advised his family of the reason and discussed it with them. He did not seek 
counseling at that point but ceased accessing the sites. </P> 
<P>Applicant filed for divorce in April 2004, and his wife moved across the country to live with her parents. The divorce became final in August 2005. He has two 
children, a son from his wife's first marriage who is adopted and currently serving the Air Force, and a daughter who is 18 and lives with Applicant while 
attending college. He has one brother with whom he shares a close relationship. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>A medical doctor specializing in neurology and psychiatry with 26 years of practice testified for Applicant and submitted a report of his evaluation (Exh. C). He 
met with Applicant for three hours on one day after the SOR was issued. He also conferred with him several times by telephone. The doctor also discussed 
Applicant with his daughter confirming some of the information regarding Applicant's wife and the difficulties her illness had caused Applicant and the 
children. He also discussed Applicant's medical history with his internist from whom he learned of his hypertension problems. </P> 
<P>The four page medical report of the psychiatrist dated November 2, 2005, concluded, after detailing several tests and evaluations given Applicant, that he did 
not need pharmacological or psychiatric treatment and that there was no evidence that the uncharacteristic behavior in which he engaged would be repeated. He 
concluded that Applicant should work to increase self-awareness and would benefit from increased contact with family and friends who are supportive of him 
and with whom he has developed solid supportive relationships. He also recommended a short series of non-urgent psychotherapy sessions primarily focused on 
self-awareness to correct any adjustment disorders which Applicant has agreed to do (TR. 112).  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems) regarding noncompliance with rules and regulations concerning use of an 
information technology system.(E2.A13.1.1.) Applicant has admitted his misuse of the computer by accessing the internet sites. Mitigating conditions that 
might be applicable are that the misuse was not recent (E2.A13.1.3.1),was an isolated event (E2.A13.1.3.4.), or the misuse was followed by a prompt, good 
faith effort to correct the situation. (E2.A13.1.3.5.) The misuse occurred over an extended period of time so could not be considered an isolated event. The 
misuse ended with his discharge by his employer so it was not voluntary. Evidence at the hearing and the testimony of the psychiatrist establish that it has not 
resumed and is not likely to do so. The misuse was three years ago. I therefore conclude that it was not recent and find in his favor as he has taken significant 
steps to correct the situation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had a successful career in the defense industry and lost his position because of his misconduct. He has been candid with his family and his new 
employer who is apparently willing to give him another chance to resume his career. In his testimony he was candid and forthright. His divorce has changed the 
circumstances of his life and the pressures he was under because of her long illnesses has been lessened. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive, questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The Government has established that Applicant has been 
involved in a pattern of rule violations (E2.A5.1.2.5.). The allegation is mitigated as the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress. I find that the conduct has been mitigated by the actions of the Applicant to candidly admit his actions to his 
family and his employer. He has changed his habits and, as shown by his medical testimony, it is unlikely to recur thanks to his changed attitude and efforts to 
adhere to new behavioral patterns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant is a talented person who has held 
responsible positions with several defense contractors holding a security clearance much of the time. He has been responsible for his two children and was the 
essential parenting figure for them because of his wife's illness. The medical analysis offered at the hearing supports the view that the behavior that led to the 
discharge was an aberration and unlikely to recur.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude Applicant's record of conduct 
justifies a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him.</SPAN></P>
