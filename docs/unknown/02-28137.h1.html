<P>Applicant is a computer programmer/analyst for a government contractor.  Both Applicant and his wife were born in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), 
emigrated to the U.S., and became U.S. citizens.  Applicant's parents and two sisters are residents and citizens of the PRC.  His parents are retired, aged, and 
hospitalized.  His sisters both work in a government hospital.  Applicant talks to his parents and sisters by telephone twice a month.  Security concerns based on 
foreign influence are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 4, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 
17, 2004, admitted the allegations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on August 11, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  On August 12, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing setting the case for on September 8, 2004.  Applicant appeared as scheduled and testified in his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript on 
September 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions of the facts alleged in the SOR are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a computer programmer/analyst for a government contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since May 10, 2001.  He enjoys a reputation 
among his co-workers and supervisors as loyal, dependable, reliable, conscientious, and honest.  (Tr. 36-37, 42, Applicant's Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the PRC on January 27, 1961.  He received an associate degree in mechanical engineering from Hong Kong University in 1984.  He 
emigrated to the U.S. in December 1989 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on July 21, 1995.  He was sponsored by his aunt and uncle, who emigrated to the 
U.S. in 1986 and became citizens.  Applicant continued his education in the U.S. and received a bachelor's degree in computer information systems on July 31, 
1996.  (Tr. 50-53; Government Exhibit 1, pp. 1, 3) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married to a Chinese resident and citizen on December 22, 1993, in Hangzhou, PRC.  He visited his wife and family annually in the PRC 
between 1993 and 1996. Applicant's wife emigrated to the U.S. in April 1996 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on July 6, 2000.  (Tr.  46-47; Government 
Exhibit 1, pp. 4, 6) They purchased a home in the U.S. in 2001.  They have two children, a daughter born in 1996 and a son born in 2001, native-born U.S. 
citizens.  Their children speak only English at home.  (Tr. 57)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is 83 years old and his mother is 78.  (Government Exhibit 1, p. 5)  Both are retired physicians.  (Tr. 62)  Both parents worked in a 
government hospital.  Although the hospital was a military hospital at one time, Applicant's father worked as a civilian employee.  (Tr. 66) Neither parent 
receives a government pension.  (Tr. 67)  Applicant's father has a brain disease and has been paralyzed since 2001 (Tr. 47), and his mother has serious heart 
disease.  (Tr. 48) They both are hospitalized in Hong Kong.  (Tr. 49, 52) Applicant's parents are financially independent and do not need or receive any money 
from him.  (Tr. 68)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's two sisters live and work in Hangzhou, PRC, near Hong Kong.  One is a nurse who is now working as a low-level administrator, and the other is a 
pharmacist.  (Tr. 63) They both work in a government hospital.  (Tr. 64)  Applicant traveled to China to visit his parents and sisters in September 1999, 
September 2000, February 2002, and March 2002.  (Government Exhibit 2, p. 2)  Applicant talks by telephone with his parents and his sisters about twice a 
month.  (Tr. 67)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law reside in Hangzhou and are both retired.  (Tr. 70; Government Exhibit 1, p. 6)  Applicant visited his in-laws only 
twice, once in 1993 and once in 2000.  (Tr. 70) His wife talks to her parents twice a year.  (Tr. 70) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife has a half-brother in China but she has no contact with him.  (Tr. 71) Applicant has two uncles in China but has no contact with them.  (Tr. 71)  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except for his parents and sisters, Applicant has no contacts with friends or relatives in the PRC.  (Tr. 72)  Applicant has no financial interests in the PRC.  (Tr. 
55) When Applicant last visited the PRC in March 2002, and he reported his visit to his supervisor.  (Tr. 59)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No members of Applicant's family are members of the Communist Party, members of the military, or government officials.  None have been mistreated by the 
government.  (Tr. 72)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is willing to bear arms for the U.S. and support the interests of the U.S. against any other nation.  In the event of a conflict between the PRC and U.S., 
Applicant would attempt to move his family to the U.S. if they appeared to be in danger.  (Government Exhibit 2, p. 3)  He believes that it would be 
"dishonorable" to abandon his family in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and the PRC.  (Tr. 74-75)  He believes that his parents' age, poor health, and 
good reputation would protect them from coercion.  (Tr. 75).  His parents would die without medical treatment, but they have told Appellant to not worry about 
them and to stay in the U.S. where there is a "better life."  (Tr. 75-76)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is a repressive, Communist government with foreign policy goals that are frequently at odds with the U.S.  Its intelligence services actively target the 
U.S. government, economic and industrial entities, and its own citizens.  Theft of U.S. information and technology is common.  (Government Exhibit 4, p. 4-5; 
Government Exhibit 5, p. 1; Government Exhibit 6, pp. ii-iii, xii, xxxiii)  Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC and enjoys a high degree 
of autonomy.  While part of the PRC, Hong Kong does not share its record of human rights abuses.  (Government Exhibit 5, pp. 46-61)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to U.S. citizens 
"whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the U.S., strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and 
sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the 
use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 3) also 
may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge "is not compelled, as a matter of law, to conclude [an applicant's] family ties in a foreign country pose an unacceptable security risk."  
ISCR Case No. 98-0419 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 1999), 1999 WL 511297 (D.I.S.C.R.).  Instead, an administrative judge must "consider the evidence as a whole 
to reach a reasoned decision as to whether the particular facts and circumstances of family ties in a foreign country raise security concerns within the meaning 
of [Guideline] B."  <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant's father, mother, and two sisters are citizens and residents of the PRC, DC 1 is established.  Applicant's parents are retired and do not 
receive a pension from the Chinese government.  Thus, DC 3 is not established with respect to Applicant's parents.  However, Applicant's two sisters are 
employed in a government-owned hospital, and accordingly they are "connected" as employees with the Chinese government.  Therefore, DC 3 is established 
with respect to Applicant's two sisters.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are not members of his "immediate family" within the meaning of Guideline B.  They, like Applicant's parents, are 
also retired and not "connected" as employees with the Chinese government.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for or 
obligation to, his spouse's immediate family members.  ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  That presumption is rebutted in this case by 
evidence that Applicant has met his in-laws only twice, in 1993 and 2000, he has had no contact with them since 2000.  Applicant's spouse talks to her parents 
only twice a year.  Thus, I conclude that DC 1 and DC 3 are not established with respect to his spouse's parents. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) . . . are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government has produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 with respect to his parents 
as well as DC 1 and DC 3 with respect to his sisters, the burden has shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  
Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are not agents of a foreign power as that term is defined in 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b).  The possibility that they would be coerced or exploited is 
reduced because they are self-supporting, not dependant on the government for a salary or pension, and they reside in the semi-autonomous region of Hong 
Kong.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sisters are likewise not agents of a foreign power, but they are dependent on the PRC government for their livelihood.  Applicant's concern for his 
family in the event of a PRC-US conflict is laudable, but it also demonstrates the potential for coercion or exploitation.  The vulnerability of Applicant's sisters 
to government coercion or exploitation must be assessed in the context of the vulnerabilities of Applicant's parents to coercion or exploitation.  While 
Applicant's parents reside in a less repressive region of the PRC, they are not completely insulated from government exploitation.  All four members of 
Applicant's immediate family are vulnerable to some level of government exploitation.  The burden of establishing a mitigating condition is on Applicant.  
Doubtful cases must be resolved in favor of national security.  Thus, although it is a close call, I conclude that MC 1 is not established regarding Applicant's 
immediate family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that Applicant's parents and in-laws are elderly and retired, standing alone, does not mitigate security concerns under Guideline B.  ISCR Case No. 03-05645 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2004).  A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent."  However, MC 3 is not established because Applicant's contacts with his parents and sisters are neither casual nor infrequent.  Since no mitigating 
conditions are established, I resolve the allegations in the SOR, &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegation in the SOR, &para; 1.d. is ambiguous.  It is partly favorable to Applicant (his willingness to bear arms for the U.S.) and partly adverse (his concern for 
his family).  Although willingness to bear arms for a foreign country is a disqualifying condition under Guideline C, willingness to bear arms for the U.S. is 
neither a disqualifying condition nor a mitigating condition under Guideline B.  Since Applicant's concern for his family is encompassed in the SOR, &para;&para; 1.a., 
1.b., and 1.c., I have resolved this allegation in Applicant's favor, based on his willingness to bear arms for the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline B (Foreign Influence): AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
