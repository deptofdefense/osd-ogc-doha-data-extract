<P>Applicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in at least three alcohol-related incidents, the first taking place in 1995 and the last in 2001. Applicant continues to 
consume alcohol to the point of intoxication. Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is not sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history.  
Additionally, in a signed, sworn 2002 Security Clearance Application (SCA) supplied to the Government, Applicant failed to disclose his alcohol related arrest 
and conviction in 2001. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated February 24, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On June 18, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM)<A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant filed no response to the FORM . The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-9). Applicant has offered no documentary evidence into the record. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his response to the SOR, Applicant 
has admitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d., and denied 2.a. and 2.b. The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 26 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has consumed alcohol since approximately 1994, when he was 17 years of age.  When Applicant was in college, he consumed alcohol, generally 
during the weekends, between four </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">and eight beers on each occasion, and he would become intoxicated approximately one time each weekend.  Applicant continues to consume alcohol (Exhibit 
5). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1995, Applicant was found guilty of Underage Drinking and ordered to pay a fine of $186. As a result of this, the university that he was attending ruled that 
he violated its alcohol policy and required him to complete an alcohol education class.  In 1996, he was charged by his university with violating its alcohol 
policy for possession and consumption of alcohol, and he was fined $90.  Finally, in 2001, Applicant was arrested and ultimately plead guilty to Willful, 
Reckless Operation of a Vehicle.  Initially, he was also charged with Driving While Intoxicated, when his blood alcohol registered .10% on a Breathalyzer field 
test.  That charge was not filed after a hospital test of his blood alcohol showed that the blood alcohol level was .084%, because that amount was under the legal 
limit for Driving While Intoxicated.   Applicant was fined $123, and he was ordered to complete six months of supervised probation. The judge in the case 
sentenced him to nine hours of DUI classes, because he believed that alcohol consumption was a significant factor in this incident (Exhibits 5 and 9). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government.  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 
completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on April 9, 2002. Question #24 asks, "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any 
offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?" Applicant answered  "Yes" to question #24, and he listed the one alcohol related arrest in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant did not discuss his arrest in 2001.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> He has stated that he had not been charged with an alcohol related offense on this occasion, so he contended that he 
did not have to list this arrest on his SCA (Exhibit 3).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER></CENTER>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use; (E2.A7.1.2.1.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">5. Habitual of binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment; (E2.A7.1.2.5.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.)<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance 
action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;(E2.A5.1.2.2.).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G) and that he 
furnished untruthful information to the Government (Guideline E). Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation 
or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG> Applicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">three alcohol related incidents, the most recent in 2001.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">While he was ultimately not charged with an alcohol related offense in the 2001 incident, it is reasonable to conclude, based on the judge's assessment and the 
amount of alcohol in Applicant's bloodstream, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.084%</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, that  Applicant's alcohol consumption was a significant factor in his arrest and conviction.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As to the amount of alcohol he now consumes, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> acknowledged in a statement to the Defense Security Service, signed under oath in 2002, that he 
currently, he drinks one time a week, usually on the weekend, and generally between four and eight beers at each session (Exhibit 5). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, which is Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) 1. He has been involved in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, which is DC 5 .</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant continues to 
consume alcohol on a regular basis, consuming as many as four to eight beers during at least one session each week. Applicant has a demonstrated history of 
drinking to excess, and he presents no credible evidence to support a conclusion he has reformed his habit. No Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. Paragraph 1 
is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal  conduct)</STRONG>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such 
an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the 
judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">While technically, Applicant was not charged with an alcohol related offense in 2001, the Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant's 
arrest and conviction was  related to his driving after he had consumed alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">by Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> failing to list this arrest and 
conviction on the 2002 SCA</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, he has intentionally provided less than complete information to the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC 2 applies because of the incomplete information that Applicant provided in his SCA.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and  2 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
