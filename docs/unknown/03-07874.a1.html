  Given the record evidence in this case, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to fail to consider and discuss Applicant's probationary status.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge did not have a rational basis for applying Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions 2  and 3.  The Judge offered no discernible basis for his conclusion that Applicant's continued drinking to intoxication did not pose a security risk.  Department  Counsel need not prove that Applicant's alcohol abuse resulted in a security violation or that Applicant's alcohol abuse poses a clear and present danger or  imminent threat to national security.  The Judge articulated a standard for establishing a nexus between alcohol abuse and security eligibility that exists in  neither the Directive nor under existing case law, and which runs contrary to the language of the Concern section of Guideline G.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 4, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).  
Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a favorable security clearance decision dated December 8, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance determination is arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) are arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that 
Applicant's consumption of alcohol resulted in citations or arrests in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002.  The Judge also found that although Applicant had 
significantly reduced his alcohol consumption, he still consumed it, on occasion, to the point of intoxication.  The Judge concluded that Applicant's 1998 and 
2002 alcohol-related incidents were security significant and required application of Guideline G Disqualifying Condition 1.<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Judge then concluded that 
although Applicant continues to consume alcohol, it has been years since he consumed it to excess (<EM>i.e</EM>., to the point his ability to safeguard classified 
information would be adversely affected).  He also concluded that the fact that Applicant no longer drives after consuming alcohol ensures there will be no 
additional alcohol-related driving incidents, thus eliminating that security concern.  The Judge concluded that Applicant qualified for Guideline G Mitigating 
Conditions 2<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and 3.<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Department Counsel asserts the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the 
following reasons: (a) the Judge's failure to mention or consider the fact that Applicant was on court-ordered probation at the time of the hearing and would 
remain on probation until January 2005 reflected arbitrary and capricious action under the particular circumstances of this case; and (b) the Judge's application 
of Guideline G Mitigating Conditions 2 and 3 in Applicant's favor was error.  Department Counsel's assertions have merit.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's decision makes no mention of the fact that, at the time of the close of the record in the case, Applicant was still under court-imposed probation for his 2002 alcohol-related incident (a DUI).  An administrative judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of evidence before 
him in his decision.  However, failure to discuss an important aspect of a case is error.  Nothing in the Directive indicates that an applicant's current 
probationary status is a <EM>per se </EM>bar to a favorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0710 (June 20, 1997) at p. 3.  However, given the fact 
that in this case the Judge's evaluation of Applicant's more recent pattern of alcohol consumption after his earlier alcohol-related incidents was critical to his 
resolution of the case, the fact that Applicant has been on probation during the more recent period cannot simply be disregarded.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 90-1115 
(October 6, 1992) at  p. 3.  Under the circumstances of this case, the Judge's failure to consider and discuss the fact that Applicant was on probation indicates 
arbitrary and capricious action by the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant still consumes alcohol occasionally to the point of intoxication.<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The Judge then concluded that Applicant's 
drinking was no longer excessive and applied Guideline G Mitigating Condition 2.  The Judge's conclusion that Applicant's alcohol consumption is no longer 
excessive is not sustainable in light of his finding that Applicant still drinks to intoxication.  Given Applicant's admission that he still drinks to intoxication, the 
Judge did not have a rational basis for concluding Applicant's alcohol abuse was sufficiently dated to warrant application of Mitigating Condition 2.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 98-0676 (August 15, 2000) at p. 4 (Applicant's admission that he drinks to intoxication several times a year precluded application of Guideline 
G Mitigating Condition 2).  Similarly, Department Counsel is correct in arguing that the record evidence of Applicant's alcohol abuse since his last alcohol-related incident in 2002 undercuts the Judge's stated rationale for his application of Mitigating Condition 3.  As Department Counsel notes, the arbitrary and 
capricious nature of the Judge's analysis is shown when the Judge concludes that Applicant's current consumption level is not excessive in the face of record 
evidence establishing that Applicant still drinks to intoxication once or twice a month, and drank to intoxication on an evening approximately one week before 
the hearing.  Furthermore, as part of his rationale for applying Mitigating Condition 3, the Judge concluded that because Applicant no longer drives after 
consuming alcohol, he has insured that no additional alcohol-related incidents will occur.  The Judge then concluded that the security concern expressed under 
Guideline G Disqualifying Condition 1 had been eliminated.  Such analysis is error.  Even if Applicant has not had alcohol-related incidents (as enumerated in 
Disqualifying Condition 1) since 2002, the record evidence of subsequent alcohol abuse by Applicant precludes application of Mitigating Condition 3.  The 
Judge's reasoning is arbitrary and capricious because it focuses on the absence of one symptom (<EM>i.e.</EM>, alcohol-related incidents) and ignores the record evidence 
of security significance (<EM>i.e.</EM>, Applicant's continued drinking to intoxication).</P> 
 
<P>Moreover, the Administrative Judge at one point stated that, despite his finding that Applicant still consumed alcohol occasionally to the point of intoxication, 
there was no evidence that Applicant's use of alcohol during the past several years reached the point that it would have adversely affected his ability to 
safeguard classified information.  The Judge offers no discernible basis for this conclusion.  Department Counsel need not prove that Applicant's alcohol abuse 
has resulted in a security violation<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> or that Applicant's alcohol abuse poses a clear and present danger or imminent threat to national security.<A HREF="03-07874.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The Judge is 
articulating a standard for establishing a nexus between alcohol abuse and security eligibility that exists neither in the Directive nor under existing case law, and 
which runs contrary to the language of the Concern section of Guideline G.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion </STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating that the Administrative Judge erred.  Considering the Judge's errors in their totality, 
correction of those errors warrants reversal.  Accordingly, pursuant to Item E3.1.33.3. of the Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board reverses the Judge's 
December 8, 2004 decision.</P>
