<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, who is 49-years-old, was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC). He immigrated to the United States (U.S.) in 1986,and became a U.S. 
citizen in 1998. He worked on the development of a computer simulator weapons system for small firearms, a commercial firearm shooting sport system, and a 
software system to translate Chinese characters. He routinely demonstrated the simulator weapons system and sport shooting system for customers, including 
visitors from the PRC. He now owns his own company, and he communicates with former classmates and co-workers in the PRC about business matters. He 
deliberately failed to identify his PRC business contacts when he submitted his security clearance application. He has not mitigated the government's concerns 
under foreign influence and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>On June 17, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6,Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On July 5, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a 
hearing. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>This matter was assigned to me on January 30, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2006, and a hearing was held on March 28, 2006. Nine 
government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were admitted into evidence. Applicant and one witness testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on 
April 10, 2006.<BR>

firearms with specific modifications related to other military weapons systems and night vision goggle use.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A> In addition, this company sought ammunition, 
which Applicant would obtain through a subcontractor. The subcontractor would buy the ammunition from Chinese manufacturers.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> After meeting with the 
representative on several occasions, Applicant provided the representative with a partial price quote, but then withdrew from negotiations when the 
representative suggested changing the shipping port from Jordan, a country Applicant believed friendly to the U.S., to Italy because of the document filings 
required by Jordan.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A><BR>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Although the presence or absence of a 
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be 
measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the 
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_89_"><SUP> (89)</SUP></A><BR>

for an applicant.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_90_"><SUP> (90)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_91_"><SUP> (91)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the

</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline s most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence - Guideline B: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation, could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG><BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant endured government repression during most of his childhood. The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s severely impacted his parents 
and his family. Despite this immensely stressful time, he successfully competed for admission to college. When the government of the PRC presented him with 
an opportunity to attend school in the U.S., he accepted. He came to the U.S., and eventually became a citizen. He has succeeded in his career. He is living the 
American dream. His loyalty to the U.S. is unquestioned, and is not a factor which determines his right to a security clearance. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B. Since arriving in the U.S., Applicant has continually maintained contacts with family, friends, 
colleagues, and co-workers in the PRC. He also developed friendships and business connections with PRC immigrants in the U.S., some of whom have ongoing 
connections in the PRC. Through business, both as an employee and an owner, he routinely interacted with representatives of the PRC and other countries with 
interests contrary to the U.S. These individuals seek him out, partly because of his involvement in the development of a small firearms simulated weapons 
system. With his contacts, he has placed himself in a position for potential coercion, exploitation or pressure by a foreign power or its agents. Disqualifying 
Condition Foreign Influence (DC FI) E2.A2.1.6. (Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign 
government) applies.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's contacts with family and friends from his homeland and other immigrants from the PRC are important to him and his family, and to the growth of 
his business. While some of his contacts with the foreign visitors at his prior place of employment were casual and infrequent, he has not mitigated the 
government's concerns about his security worthiness. He continues to have business and personal contacts with former Chinese classmates and co-workers who 
are now business owners in the PRC, and with immigrants from the PRC, who still maintain business contacts in the PRC. Over the last 20 years, he has relied 
heavily upon these contacts as part of his life in the U.S.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In determining whether he is in a position to be exploited by the government of the PRC because of these contacts, the character of the PRC's government and 
its relationship with the U.S. is an important factor. The PRC is an authoritarian, communist state with a strong interest in obtaining military and economic 
information from the U.S. It is an active collector of defense, medical, economic, technological, and computer information. There is a history of the PRC 
government exploiting or using influence, pressure, force, incentive, or coercion for the purpose of making the holder of a security clearance in the U.S. act 
adversely to the U.S. Applicant's involvement in the development of a  simulated small weapons program makes him an individual of interest to the PRC. The 
government of the PRC has actively sought this system, and would not be adverse to approaching his contacts, who are its citizens and residents, and pressuring 
them to obtain needed information from him directly or through his contacts. While Applicant is a loyal citizen of the U.S. who does not want to harm his new 
country, the PRC would seek to exploit his skills and knowledge whenever possible. He is in a position of potential harm, which causes security concerns for 
the government. The Applicant has not mitigated the government's concerns. Guideline B is found against Applicant. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, the government alleges Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his latest security clearance application when he answered "no" to 
Question 12, when he failed to provide detailed answers to Question 14, and when he twice failed to provide this information in his signed, sworn statements. 
He denies intentionally falsifying his answers. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an 
omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider 
the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_99_"><SUP> (99)</SUP></A> For Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . .) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . .) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant's omission, concealment or falsification in his 
answers related to a relevant and material fact and was deliberate.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E. Although Applicant has denied that he intentionally falsified his answers to Questions 12 and 14, 
the questions are clear about the information requested from him. He knew that during the years he worked at the computer company, he regularly demonstrated 
the simulated small firearms system to visitors, including visitors from the PRC. His job required him to show the positive operational aspects of this system to 
potential business customers. These customers are business connections for him as well as his former employer. He also knew that he had contacted, for 
personal reasons, the Embassy of the PRC long after he resigned his position as president of a student organization.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I have considered the mitigating factors and conclude that none apply. Applicant did not voluntarily provide correct information after completing his security 
clearance; rather, he provided this information only after being confronted by the investigator. In addition, his failed to voluntarily report the potential sale of a 
modified simulated small firearms weapons system by his company to a company which intended to ship the system and ammunition to Jordan. He did not 
consult with legal counsel or authorized personnel about his answers before submitting his application. Given his continued correspondence with for college 
classmates and co-workers in the PRC, he has not taken the necessary steps to significantly reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress. Guideline E is found against Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J, a single serious offense can raise a security concern. It is a felony punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, 
to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive 
branch of the Government of the United States.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_100_"><SUP> (100)</SUP></A> Security clearance are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United 
States.<A HREF="04-08464.h1.html#N_101_"><SUP> (101)</SUP></A> A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application or in response to questions by a security investigator is a serious crime within the 
meaning of Guideline J.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant falsified his answers to his security clearance. His criminal conduct raises Criminal 
Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.2.2. (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses). Applicant has not mitigated this criminal conduct. 
Guideline J is found against him. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance 
to Applicant.<BR>
