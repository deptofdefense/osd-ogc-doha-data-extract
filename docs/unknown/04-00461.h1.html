<P>Applicant has had a history of consuming alcohol to excess, which resulted in at least five alcohol related incidents from 1978 until 2001. Applicant has not 
consumed any alcohol since December 29, 2001, and he has modified his lifestyle to strongly improve the likelihood that he will not have any relapses in the 
future. Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Clearance is granted.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On March 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">notarized response, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">March 24, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based 
on a hearing record b</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">efore a DOHA Administrative Judge.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">May 23, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the 
parties on August 2, 2005, and the hearing was held on August 24, 2005</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 9) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his counsel, offered 11 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - K) and his own testimony and that of four additional witnesses. The transcript (Tr) was received on September 16, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive because of Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption. The 
SOR contains seven allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., under Guideline G.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In his Response to the SOR (RSOR) Applicant admits all of the allegations.  The 
admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 49 years old. He is married and has two step-children. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline G - Alcohol consumption). </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's drinking has resulted in at least five alcohol related incidents. They occurred in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1992, and 2001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 3, 1978, Applicant received a Non-Judicial Punishment for Unauthorized Absence and Drinking on Duty. He was reduced to the next inferior pay 
grade and fined $100 (RSOR, Exhibit 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 11, 1979, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was recommended for separation from the United States  Navy for Unsuitability based in part on admitted alcohol abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> and 
other repeated military offenses. In </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 22,1979, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was diagnosed with Alcoholism, and he was referred to an Navy alcohol abuse program. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He 
refused to attend the program (RSOR, Exhibits 7, 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On July 15, 1981, Applicant was arrested and charged with three Counts; 1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), 2) Driving Too Slow and 3) Vehicle 
Tabs Violation.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> pled guilty to Counts 2 and 3, and the DUI charge was dismissed. He was fined $28 (RSOR, Exhibit 6). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On May 7, 1992,  Applicant was arrested and charged with two Counts; 1) DUI, and 2) Driving with 0.08 % or more by weight, alcohol in blood. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> pled guilty 
to Count 1, and Count 2 was dismissed. He was sentenced to serve 48 hours in jail, five years unsupervised probation, fined $1,382, and he was ordered to 
attend an alcohol education program (RSOR, Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 29, 2001,  Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> pled guilty, and he was placed on five years probation and fined $2,010 (RSOR, 
Exhibits 3, 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant testified that he has not consumed any alcoholic beverage since his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 29, 2001 arrest, and he intends never to imbibe in the future.  While he 
had attempted to abstain from alcohol before and ultimately began to drink again, he has had a number of  significant changes in his life since he last consumed 
alcohol, including the fact that he is now married and has two step-children, that he has a more satisfying and less stress filled job, and he is more committed to 
his religion. All of these changes are helping him to remain alcohol free in the future (Tr at 109-111).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> submitted a letter from the company that had tested him during the period of his probation from </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 2002 through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 2004. He was tested 
on average 6 to 8 times a month for drug and alcohol; he always promptly appeared for his testing and his tests were always negative (Exhibit H).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Four witnesses, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> wife testified on his behalf.  His wife testified that  her husband has never consumed alcohol in her presence, and his 
desire is not to consume alcohol in the future. One of the other witnesses knew </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> primarily in a work setting, but all three had seen </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> in social 
settings. They all spoke very positively about </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">,  and none of them had ever seen </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> consume alcohol. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>  </STRONG>Applicant submitted a number of additional documents that were extremely favorable to him. These included two performance appraisals, one of which he 
received in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 20, 2005. He always </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">met or exceeded all of his requirements, and his supervisor stated that he was, "reliable and can always be counted on to go the extra mile on assigned tasks. . . . 
He is highly regarded by customers and co-workers alike." (Exhibits B, C).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibit E </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">is a  report of a psychiatrist, who examined </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> in preparation for this case. He strongly opined that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> was devoid of psychiatric or 
substance illness, and he is unlikely to have alcohol related problems in the future.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> submitted 33 letters of appreciation, recommendation and awards. The letters came from individuals who have known </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in many 
different settings. All of them spoke in extremely positive terms about Applicant, including his trustworthiness, integrity and exceptional work ability (Exhibits 
H, I). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant, on 
the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).</STRONG> While Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol, at times to excess, which did cause him a 
number of significant alcohol-related problems, he was credible when he testified that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">he has not  consumed any alcohol since </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 2001, nor will he 
consume alcohol in the future.  In addition to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">'s testimony, I have considered the report of the examining psychiatrist, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">excellent  recommendations 
that he received from the witnesses who testified at the hearing and the many individuals, including supervisors, co-workers and friends, who submitted letters 
of reference and were extremely laudatory to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I did consider that Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> had tried to abstain from alcohol in the past, and ultimately he resumed consuming alcohol. However, I find that the changes in his 
current life, including the fact that he is now married and has two step-children, that he has a more satisfying and less stress filled job, and he is more 
committed to his religion, to be significant and compelling reasons why he has a far, greater opportunity to be successful in the future. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government did establish that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A7.1.2.1.), 
and that he has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the Mitigating Conditions (MC),  (E2.A7.1.3.2.) is applicable because the problem last occurred almost four years ago, in 2001, and there is no 
indication of a recent problem. Also, MC (E2.A7.1.3.3.) applies because of the positive changes in Applicant's behavior supportive of sobriety. Overall, the 
mitigating conditions outweigh the disqualifying conditions, and Guideline G is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding for Applicant as expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
