  Application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions is not a simple, mechanical operation or reducible to a simple formula.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.   Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for not applying various Financial Considerations mitigating conditions.   The Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties provide a rational basis for the Judge to conclude Applicant had failed  to present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns raised by his overall history of financial difficulties.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 12, 2003, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated July 1, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issue: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to applicable mitigating 
conditions.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to applicable mitigating conditions</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant does not dispute the 
Administrative Judge's findings of fact with respect to the Applicant's business and financial history.  Rather, Applicant contends the Judge should have 
concluded that the security concerns raised by his unresolved federal tax debt were mitigated by application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 
1,<A HREF="01-21243.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 2,<A HREF="01-21243.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 3,<A HREF="01-21243.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 4,<A HREF="01-21243.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="01-21243.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that evidence supporting those Mitigating Conditions was not considered by the 
Administrative Judge, and that when properly weighed that evidence was sufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  For the reasons set forth 
below, we disagree.</P> 
 
<P>It is clear from the Administrative Judge's findings of fact and conclusions that the Judge considered the evidence which the Applicant considers mitigating and 
concluded that it was not sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by the Applicant's indebtedness.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions is not a simple, mechanical operation or reducible to a simple formula.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or 
mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) 
at p. 7 (discussing various considerations that must be taken into account by an adjudicator when applying Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating 
conditions).  Accordingly, even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances outside his control, the Judge reasonably could consider 
whether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0462 (May 25, 2000) at p. 4 ("Even if 
an applicant gets into financial difficulties because of circumstances beyond the applicant's control, the Judge must consider whether the applicant dealt with his 
or her financial difficulties in a reasonable manner."); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 (December 1, 1999) at p. 4 ("It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to 
consider whether Applicant made timely, reasonable efforts to deal with the financial setbacks that resulted from conditions beyond his control.").  In this case, 
it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to it consider Applicant's failure to resolve his outstanding federal tax debt after the conditions which had 
contributed to it becoming delinquent had passed and his financial situation had improved.</P> 
 
<P>Similarly, given Applicant's previous bankruptcy filings, and the fact that the federal tax debt at issue had been incurred years earlier, but still not resolved as of 
the date of the hearing, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's debt was recent, and that there was insufficient evidence for 
him to conclude that there were clear indications that the problem was under control.</P> 
 
<P>Likewise, the Board has previously discussed what constitutes a "good-faith" effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:</P> 
 
<P>"In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.' However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6."  ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6 (citation and 
footnote omitted).</P> 
 
<P>Given the fact that the federal tax debt was incurred in 1995, that the Applicant had repeatedly denied liability for it, that he had filed for bankruptcy on several 
occasions in an effort to avoid it, and been unsuccessful in reaching any agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (such as a payment plan) with respect to 
the debt, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to decide that the evidence was insufficient for him to conclude that Applicant's efforts to repay or 
otherwise resolve the debt had been made in "good-faith."</P> 
 
<P>Finally, the favorable record evidence cited by Applicant, including the fact that the security concerns arose as a result of a single, large debt, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole 
and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the 
record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Given the fact that 
the amount of the debt exceeded the amount earned by the Applicant in a year, it was reasonable for the Judge to conclude that the Applicant had not rebutted 
the Government's case regarding his financial difficulties.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made findings of fact and reached conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties that provided a rational basis for the 
Judge to conclude Applicant had failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns raised by his overall history of financial difficulties.</P>
