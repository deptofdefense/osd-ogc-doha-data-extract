  Because the Board must be fair and impartial in its handling of appeals, the Board cannot and will not develop the record evidence at the request of a party.  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or generally applicable principles of federal administrative law gives  Applicant a right to supplement the record evidence continuously.  Under the Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional or probationary security clearance.   Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 9, 2003 which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated June 24, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Board should contact various individuals and institutions to confirm what steps Applicant has taken to deal 
with his financial difficulties; and (2) whether Applicant should be allowed to have a conditional or probationary security clearance so that he can have an opportunity to 
deal with his financial difficulties.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-21604.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant has a history of financial difficulties, and that  as of the time of the hearing Applicant had not addressed or resolved his 
financial difficulties.  The Judge also found that Applicant falsified a security clearance application in August 2001 by failing to disclose material facts about his financial 
difficulties.  The Judge entered formal findings against Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and concluded it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should contact various individuals and institutions to confirm what steps Applicant has taken to deal with his financial difficulties</SPAN>.  On appeal, 
Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact about his history of financial difficulties.  However, Applicant's appeal brief lists two individuals 
and three organizations that Applicant states the Board can contact if it wants to confirm what steps he has taken to deal with his financial difficulties.  The Board will not 
contact those individuals and organizations.</P> 
 
<P>The Board must be fair and impartial in its handling of appeals.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section 4.1 ("All proceedings provided for by this Directive shall be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner.")  It would be inconsistent with that obligation if the Board were to allow itself to act as an agent or surrogate advocate for one of the parties.  
Accordingly, the Board cannot and will not act as an agent  for Applicant in developing the record for him.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's proffer of new evidence does not demonstrate error below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Moreover, a review of the record below persuades the Board that Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in his case.  Nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or generally applicable principles of federal administrative law gives 
Applicant a right to supplement the record evidence continuously.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21274 (January 8, 2004) at p. 3.  Furthermore, Applicant cannot fairly 
challenge the Judge's decision based on a proffer of evidence that he did not present for the Judge's consideration.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant should be allowed to have a conditional or probationary security clearance so that he can have an opportunity to deal with his financial difficulties</SPAN>.  
aking allowances for Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> status, the Board construes various statements in Applicant's appeal brief as asking that he be allowed to have a conditional or 
probationary security clearance so that he can have an opportunity to deal with his financial difficulties.  Under the Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21274 (January 8, 2004) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision because Applicant has not demonstrated any error below.</P>
