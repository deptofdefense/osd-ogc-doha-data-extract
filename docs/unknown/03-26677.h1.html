<P>Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  His mother-in-law is a permanent U.S. resident and has 
resided with Applicant for 13 years.  She receives no income or benefits from the PRC.  His father-in-law, a retired accountant, lives in a small government-owned house in the PRC and receives government medical care.  Applicant visited the PRC once to help his father-in-law move into his house, and he sends 
him about $1,000.00 per year.  His contact with his father-in-law since 1998 has been limited to financial assistance and occasional exchange of pleasantries by 
telephone.  The security concern based on foreign influence is mitigated.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 4, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  It alleges Applicant's father-in-law is a citizen 
and resident of the PRC (&para; 1.a.), Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC temporarily residing with him (&para; 1.b.), Applicant sends his father-in-law 
$500.00 to $1,000.00 per year (&para; 1.c.), and Applicant traveled to the PRC in 1998 (&para; 1.d.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 24, 2005.  He admitted all the allegations  in the SOR and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to 
me on June 15, 2005.  On June 23, 2005, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for July 12, 2005.  The case was heard as scheduled.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 39-year-old project manager for a defense contractor.  He was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC), came to the U.S. in 1985, obtained 
a college degree in 1990, and received a master's degree in computer science in 1993.  He has worked for his present employer since November 1993.  He 
enjoys a reputation among his colleagues and supervisors as a talented, dedicated, trustworthy employee.  He became a U.S. citizen in August 2002.  In 
September 2002, he Americanized his name by legally changing his first name to "Peter."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's spouse was born in the PRC and became a U.S. citizen in November 1991. They were married in February 1992.  They have two children, both 
native-born U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and mother were born in the PRC.  His father became a U.S. citizen in August 1999.  His mother is a citizen of the PRC and a permanent 
U.S. resident since 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law is a citizen and resident of the PRC.  His father-in-law is 75 years old and a retired accountant who worked for a government-owned 
grocery store.  He came to the U.S. in 1997 and returned to the PRC after about six months.  He receives no pension.  His only sources of income are his 
savings and about $1,000.00 per year he receives from Applicant.  He lives in the PRC because he is in poor health and the cost of health care is less in the PRC 
than in the U.S.  He lives in a small government-owned, rent-controlled house.  If he were ejected from his government-owned house, Applicant would increase 
the amount of money he sends his father-in-law by about $50.00 per month to enable him to rent a privately-owned residence.  According to Applicant, the PRC 
"doesn't know even [sic] he exists."  (Tr. 63.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his family traveled to the PRC for about one month in 1998, to assist his father-in-law in finding a place to live.  During this visit, Applicant's 
mother-in-law stayed with her husband, and Applicant stayed in a hotel with his wife and children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen of the PRC.  She is 73 years old and was never employed.  Contrary to the allegation in the SOR &para; 1.b., she has lived 
permanently with Applicant and his wife in the U.S. for more than 13 years.  She has not become a U.S. citizen because she cannot speak English.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife and mother-in-law contact his father-in-law by telephone once every two weeks.  Applicant exchanges pleasantries with his father-in-law, but 
his wife and mother-in-law conduct most of the conversation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is an authoritarian state with a poor human rights record.  The Communist Party is the paramount source of power, and party members hold almost all 
top government positions.<A HREF="03-26677.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The PRC has a significant intelligence collection capability targeted against the U.S.  Persons with access to advanced propriety 
technology are subject to surveillance, and their hotel rooms and personal computers are subject to search without their consent or knowledge.<A HREF="03-26677.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Industrial 
espionage is a serious concern in the U.S.<A HREF="03-26677.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family (spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or sister), or other persons to whom he or she 
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying. However, such ties do raise a prima facie 
security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of 
persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 
DOHA LEXIS 59 (Feb. 8 2001) at 33-34.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family 
members are vulnerable to government coercion.  The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian 
government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of Applicant's immediate family members are residents of the PRC.  His mother is a PRC citizen, but her citizenship status is not alleged in the SOR.  
The security concern set out in the SOR is focused on his mother-in-law and father-in-law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of 
affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 
20, 2002).  Applicant's mother-in-law has been a member of his household for more than 13 years.  His father-in-law visited for about six months more than 
seven years ago and then returned to the PRC.  The record indicates Applicant has no particular ties of affection for his father-in-law, but he appears to have ties 
of obligation to his father-in-law, evidenced by his financial assistance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I conclude DC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the 
immediate family members (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.  
Because Applicant has ties of affection and obligation to his spouse's parents, the underlying considerations of MC 1 are relevant, even though in-laws are not 
"immediate family members."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law has never been employed by or connected with the PRC government.  He has never been part of the high-technology environment in 
which Applicant works.  He clearly is not an agent of a foreign power.  He receives no government pension, but he depends on the government for medical care 
and housing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has considered the possibility of his father-in-law losing his housing and is able and willing to pay for substitute housing if necessary.  Applicant has 
considered the possibility of bringing his father-in-law to the U.S. but cannot afford to pay for his father-in-law's medical expenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law is not an agent of a foreign power.  She receives nothing from the PRC government.  She lives permanently with Applicant in the 
U.S. and is not subject to the authority of the PRC government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) applies when "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive E2.A2.1.3.2.  The record 
reflects Applicant's contacts with his father-in-law are limited to occasional pleasantries as an adjunct to his wife's conversations.  Although he calls 
"sometimes," his wife and mother-in-law are the primary points of contact.  I conclude MC 3 is established for Applicant's contacts with his father-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering Applicant's family ties as a whole, I conclude the security concern is mitigated.  His mother-in-law presents virtually no risk of foreign influence.  
It is theoretically possible the PRC would physically abuse his father-in-law or deprive him of his meager government benefits in an effort to influence 
Applicant, but the risk of Applicant being influenced appears to be very low.  It is even less likely Applicant's father-in-law could indirectly influence Applicant 
through his spouse or mother-in-law.  Under the circumstances of this case, to disqualify Applicant from receiving a security clearance based on his attenuated 
relationship with his father-in-law would be tantamount to adopting the rule of automatic disqualification based on foreign family ties that has been rejected by 
the Appeal Board.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Directive, I conclude the security concern based on foreign influence is 
mitigated.</SPAN></P>
