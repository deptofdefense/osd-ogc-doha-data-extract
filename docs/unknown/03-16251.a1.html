<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Maurice J. Ringel, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 3, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations) and Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 17, 2005, after 
the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the 
Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The dispositive findings of fact by the Administrative Judge that are relevant to this appeal are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P>On July 11, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by two company security officials about another matter when Applicant exhibited signs of being under the 
influence of alcohol, although he was steady on his feet.  It  was determined Applicant should be evaluated by a medical professional for the presence of 
alcohol. After a company nurse administered a sobriety test, Applicant was transported to an outside clinic for testing.  He was determined to be under the legal 
limit, although there was alcohol in his system.<A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant, who had initially denied any consumption of alcohol that day, admitted to company security 
officials that he had consumed two beers, one in the morning and one with lunch, before reporting for work that day.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He also admitted drinking one beer at 
lunch frequently, although not on company property.  Since testing was positive for alcohol, although under the legal limit for drunk driving, he could not return 
to work, but was permitted by human resources to drive himself home despite concerns of the security department.  An inspection of Applicant's vehicle 
determined there were eight unopened beers in a cooler in the back of his truck and four empty cans in the truck bed.  On his way home, Applicant purchased a 
six-pack of beer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The company required him to submit to a medical evaluation through the company's employee assistance program (EAP).  The EAP's designated medical 
mental health professional, a psychiatrist who evaluated Applicant on or before August 12, 2002, found no significant problems, alcohol or otherwise, to 
prevent Applicant's return. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Concerning </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">his drinking before reporting to work on July 11, 2002, Applicant indicated he felt completely comfortable with his ability to perform his work 
duties.  Applicant detailed his history of alcohol consumption, admitting he consumes beer, which he enjoys, on a regular basis--one beer about twice weekly 
before reporting to work, one beer almost daily during lunch, two to three beers most evenings after work, and a case of beer on weekends.  He denied drinking 
on company property or having an alcohol problem.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has two general claims of error: (a) the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant was "under the influence of alcohol" during an incident at work 
in July 2002, is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (b) the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant's alcohol consumption poses a security 
concern is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, and is inconsistent with a "whole person" analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Since the Administrative Judge found in Applicant's favor with regard to Guideline K, that Guideline is not at issue on appeal.  With regard to Guideline G, 
Applicant raises numerous objections to the Judge's conclusions<A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> as to his consumption of beer and the security concerns raised by that consumption.  Among 
the issues Applicant raises are the following:  (1) the Judge's characterization of Applicant's drinking habits, (2) the Judge's application of Guideline G 
disqualifying conditions in Applicant's case, (3) the Judge's failure to apply mitigating conditions in Applicant's situation, (4) the Judge's conclusions that 
future alcohol-related incidents at work cannot be ruled out and that Applicant has failed to meet his "burden of reform," and (5) the Judge's failure to apply or 
properly apply the relevant factors under the "whole person" analysis required by the Adjudicative Guidelines.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant claims that the Administrative Judge erred in finding in the synopsis of her decision that Applicant was "under the influence of alcohol" during an 
incident at work on July 11, 2002.  Even if we assume, solely for purposes of this appeal, that the language "under the influence of alcohol" did not accurately 
describe Applicant's situation on July 11, 2002, the Board has held that a flaw or failing in the synopsis of a decision is unlikely to be harmful error.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, 
ISCR Case No. 02-23336 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 10, 2004).  In the body of her decision, the Judge more specifically described the situation as Applicant having 
"exhibited signs of being under the influence of alcohol, although he was steady on his feet."  Decision at 6.  The Judge's focus was not on intoxication, but on 
whether there was substantial record evidence to conclude that Applicant had reported to work on July 11, 2002, in an impaired condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The Judge 
concluded that Applicant's conduct on July 11, 2002 fell within Disqualifying Condition 2.  Applicant offers a plausible alternative interpretation of the record 
evidence.  But Applicant's ability to offer such an interpretation does not prove that the Judge's conclusion was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, and it is 
sustainable given the record evidence.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Similarly, the Judge's conclusion that Applicant's conduct fell within Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 5</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> is sustainable.  Applicant stated that 
he drinks a case of beer on the weekends, and indicated that he feels "buzzed" if he drinks four to five beers on any given occasion.  The Judge reasonably 
concluded that Applicant's weekend activity falls within the disqualifying condition. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's failure to fully mitigate the security significance of his conduct, or even consider mitigation, is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant claims that over his 36-year career with his company, there was only "one, single, isolated allegation of an alcohol-related incident," which, by definition, cannot indicate a pattern of behavior.  Therefore, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "must apply."  
Applicant also contends that Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 2<A HREF="03-16251.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> must be applied because nearly three years elapsed between the "one, single, 
isolated allegation" in July 2002 and the hearing.  The Board's review of the Judge's decision indicates that she did consider mitigation, and given the record 
evidence, she was not legally required to mitigate the security concerns in this case.  While the Judge did not specifically refer to the enumerated mitigating 
conditions under Guideline G, a fair reading of the decision indicates that she did look at factors that, if applicable, might have mitigated the circumstances of 
the case (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, Applicant's drinking habits since 2002, and the absence of an evaluation that Applicant suffers from alcohol abuse or dependence).  There is no 
basis to suggest that the Judge ignored the possibility of mitigation under the enumerated Guideline G mitigating conditions because she applied the enumerated 
mitigating conditions (in Applicant's favor) under Guideline K when considering conduct under that Guideline.  The fact that the Judge did not discuss the 
enumerated conditions under Guideline G is consistent with the view that none apply.  The Judge set forth a plausible rationale which sees a reasonable security 
concern from Applicant's actual alcohol consumption pattern, even though there is no substantial evidence that Applicant suffers from a medically diagnosed 
alcohol problem.  In this rationale, the 2002 incident was not the single, isolated event that Applicant portrays it to be, but part of Applicant's drinking habits, 
unchanged since 2002, that are not reasonably consistent with sobriety. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant cites other miscellaneous errors by the Administrative Judge.  Many of these claims of error are actually related to the Judge's proper weighing of 
factors under the "whole person" concept in the Adjudicative Process provisions of the Directive.  The decision indicates that it focused on such factors as the 
individual's age and maturity (Directive &para; E2.2.1.4), the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (Directive &para; E2.2.1.6), and 
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive &para; E2.2.1.9).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The most colorable of Applicant's claims of error is the conclusion that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant "has 
failed to meet his burden of reform."  We agree with Applicant that the Directive does not describe such a burden.  However, a fair reading of the decision 
indicates that, in this context, the Judge clearly meant that Applicant had not changed his behavior.  As in 2002, when Applicant reported for work in an 
impaired state, Applicant continues to consume about a case of beer each weekend and continues to drink prior to arrival at work and during lunch.  
Accordingly, Applicant has failed to demonstrate harmful error.  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  It need not agree with the Judge's decision to 
conclude that it is sustainable.</SPAN></P>
