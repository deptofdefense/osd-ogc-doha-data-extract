<P>Applicant's falsification of his November 2001 Security Clearance Application suggested he could not be relied upon to speak the truth if the truth raised 
questions adverse to his personal interests. His history of financial difficulties cast further doubt on his fitness for access to classified information. Clearance 
denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On 15 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a  Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-24365.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 11 
November 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 10 January 2003. The record in this case closed 22 February 2003--the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was 
assigned to me on 6 March 2003 and I received the case on the same day to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate those  admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 35-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 29 November 2001, Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application(SCA)(SF 86)(Item 5) when he answered "no" to five questions that required him 
to disclose any bankruptcy filings within the last seven years (question 33), any tax liens placed within the last seven years (question 36), any unpaid judgments 
entered within the last seven years (question 37) and any delinquent accounts currently more than 90-days past due (question 38) or 180-days past due within 
the last seven years (question 39). In fact, Applicant had filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on 7 January 1999 and was discharged of nearly $70,000.00 in 
debts on 19 April 1999 (Item 10). He had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on 23 August 2001 to re-organize $47,000.00 in debt (Item 9, 11).<A HREF="02-24365.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He had a 
local property tax lien for $390.00 filed in August 1994, and an IRS tax lien for approximately $6,900.00 filed in October 2000 (Item 12).<A HREF="02-24365.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He had judgment 
for approximately $10,300.00 in unpaid salary owed to a former employee entered against him in June 1998. He had six delinquent accounts totaling 
approximately $8,500.00 (Item 8), accounts he is not paying on. Applicant falsified his clearance application because he feared unscrupulous company 
employees would use this sensitive information against him (Answer).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 4  March 2002, Applicant described the cause of his financial problems and the steps he has taken to address them (Item 7):</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I know that my past credit history is bad but it was from the result of losing my business. I've made attempts to correct my credit such as the 1<SUP>st</SUP> bankruptcy but 
that didn't work, it was only a temporary fix. I've filed a second time to restructure my debt not to escape it. I believe that if I were granted my clearance, it 
would greatly improve my financial situation and I could meet my monthly bills. I've made bad decisions in the past and I'm trying to correct them now. I am 
an honest person trying to make an honest living. I can't be blackmailed or bribed, and I hope you'll give me the chance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Personal Financial Statement (PFS)(Item 7) reflects a $414 per month positive cash flow, none of which is being used to pay any other past due 
debts except those included in the Chapter 13.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record contains no evidence of Applicant's work performance or other character evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's financial difficulties, both in the past and more 
recently. Although Applicant ascribes his financial difficulties to a failed business,<A HREF="02-24365.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> he does not explain how he fell into financial difficulties so quickly after 
his Chapter 7 discharge in April 1999. Nor does he advance any plan for addressing the eight past due accounts listed in the SOR. It does not appear that 
Applicant has stopped digging a financial hole, much less begun to dig himself out of it. I resolve Guideline F. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant provided false answers to five questions designed to disclose his financial status.  His 
explanations neither excuse nor mitigate those omissions which had the potential to influence the course of the background investigation. I resolve Guideline E. 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's deliberate falsification of his clearance application clearly violates 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. 
The falsifications had the potential to influence the course of the background investigation--in areas of legitimate concern to the government. I resolve 
Guideline J. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
