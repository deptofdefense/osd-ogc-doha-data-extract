<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old systems engineer.  When he was 19 years old, he was convicted of aggravated robbery, and he served approximately 20 months in prison.  After his release from prison, 
he was married, completed his vocational school education, raised two daughters, and gained a reputation as a dependable, hard-working employee and responsible member of the community.  He 
has mitigated the security concern based on criminal conduct, but granting him a clearance is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1).  Solely because of the statutory prohibition, clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On July 10, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security clearance.  
This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
<EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 28, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 26, 2006, 
and heard on November 15, 2006, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 29, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor engaged in simulation training.  He has worked for his current employer since June 2004.  He believes he had a clearance while 
working on simulators between 1984 and 1990 (Tr. 33-34).  He does not currently hold a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In April 1976, Applicant was charged with aggravated robbery with a knife, a felony.  At the time, he was 19 years old and on the dean's list at his vocational school (Applicant's Exhibit (AX) D).  
According to Applicant, he and a classmate decided to avoid paying a taxi fare by threatening the taxi driver with a knife.  Applicant's friend initiated the idea and wielded the knife.  No physical 
contact was made with the driver.  The taxi driver alleged that they tried to rob him.  The incident was observed by police, who promptly arrested Applicant and his friend.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was represented by a lawyer at his trial.  He pleaded not guilty, but he was convicted and sentenced to confinement for 4 to 25 years.  He was in confinement from April 6, 1976, until he 
was paroled on December 22, 1977.  He was discharged from parolee status on January 24, 1979 (Government Exhibit (GX ) 2).  He completed vocational school in November 1981 (AX E).  He 
has had no further contact with the friend who was involved with him in the incident (Tr. 40).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife was his girl friend at the time he was arrested and convicted.  They were married on December 31, 1980, after his release from prison (AX F).  They have two adult daughters, one 
of whom is a college student and one is in graduate school (Tr. 37).  Applicant's wife was present at the hearing, and their interaction indicated strong bonds of affection.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has worked continuously since his release from jail (AX J).  His former supervisor found him dependable, reliable, hard-working, conscientious and honest, and he rated him his most 
dependable and hard-working subordinate (AX A).  Another former supervisor regards him as a man of integrity who is dependable, hard-working, conscientious, honest, peace-loving, and 
courteous (AX B).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has had no further criminal violations, not even a traffic offense (AX C).  He is involved with his church (AX G and H).  His credit rating is excellent (AX I).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was articulate, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He testified that he decided after his arrest and conviction that he would not allow that single incident to define his life (Tr. 22, 33). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  
The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated 
upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each 
guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed 
in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  "Substantial evidence" is "more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance."  <EM>See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit 
Auth.</EM>, 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security 
suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct</STRONG>)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN>  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses may 
also be disqualifying (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  Applicant's conviction of a felony raises DC 2.</P> 
 
<P>Since the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  
Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing it was not recent (MC 1), it was an isolated incident (MC 2), or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC 6).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1, 
E2.A10.1.3.2, E2.A10.1.3.6.  MC 2 is established because the incident is the only criminal offense in Applicant's personal history.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The issues under both MC 1 and MC 6 are whether there has been a significant period of time without any evidence of misconduct, and whether the evidence shows changed circumstances or 
conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  The sufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does 
not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather on a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case 
based on a careful evaluation of the record.  If the evidence shows that a significant period of time has passed without evidence of misconduct by an applicant, then an administrative judge must 
articulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  ISCR 
Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude MC 1 is established because the incident happened more than 31 years ago.  MC 6 is established because Applicant has demonstrated, by a long track record of law-abiding, responsible 
behavior, that his criminal behavior is not indicative of his current attitude or life style and is not likely to recur.  </SPAN>He has established "a track record that shows [he]  . . . , through actions and 
conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that [he] has acted in the past."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 
1998).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>In addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, I have also considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant committed a serious offense, apparently because he acquiesced in the criminal suggestion of a friend and classmate.  The crime occurred when he was only 19 years old, and it is the only 
criminal offense in his personal history.  He is now 50 years old, and he is now a responsible spouse, father, and employee.  His conviction is a matter of public record and was disclosed on his 
security clearance application, eliminating the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  The likelihood of recurrence is nil.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 ("Smith Amendment")</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1), the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting or renewing a security clearance for any person who "has been convicted in any court of the 
United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year," unless the prohibition is waived 
by certain designated officials.  On its face, it is not entirely clear whether the statute imposes a prohibition or creates a disqualifying condition that cannot be mitigated.  Subsection (a) is captioned 
"<EM>prohibition</EM>," but subsection (c) is captioned, "persons <EM>disqualified </EM>from being granted a security clearance." The waiver authority set out in subsection (d) allows waiver "as an exception to the 
<EM>prohibition</EM> in subsection (a) . . . "if there are mitigating factors."  The reporting requirement in subsection (e) refers to "the <EM>disqualifying</EM> factor in subsection (c) that applied, and the reason for 
waiver of the <EM>disqualification</EM>."  Federal courts have treated the statute as imposing a prohibition.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>Wright v. U.S. Army, </EM>307 F.Supp.2d 1065 (D. Ariz. 2004); <EM>Nickelson v. United States</EM>,<EM> 284 
F.Supp.2d 387 </EM>(E.D. Va., 2003).<A HREF="06-06246.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence, I conclude 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (c)(1) applies to this case.  I also conclude that Applicant has established several enumerated mitigating conditions under Guideline J as well as 
the general adjudicative guidelines. However, I do not have authority to waive the statutory prohibition against granting a clearance. Authority to grant a waiver has been granted to the Director, 
DOHA.  My decision to deny a clearance is based solely on 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline J:   AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances of this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  However, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1), as 
amended, Applicant may not be granted a security clearance unless a waiver is granted by the Director, DOHA.  Based solely on this statutory prohibition, clearance is denied.</P>
