<P>The sexual criminal allegations against the Applicant were unfounded; and as such, they were dismissed.  However, in 1995 he was cited for and admits to 
furnishing alcohol to minors.  This isolated incident is distant enough in time as not to be of security significance.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 14, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 4, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on June 13, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 17, 2002, and the case was heard on July 10, 2002.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence, eight exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also called a witness to testify on his behalf.  The 
transcript was received on July 18, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged criminal conduct, and related sexual and personal conduct 
militates against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 46 years of age, has two 
Associate Degrees, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct, Guideline D - Sexual Behavior &amp; Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.d., 2.a. and 3.a.  In October of 1996, the Applicant was charged with three counts of Rape of a Child in the First Degree (Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at 
pages 1~2).  These allegations arose from two separate incidents.  In 1993, the Applicant was playing with two neighborhood children (Transcript (TR) at page 
29 line 9 to page 32 line 25, and at page 41 line 19 to page 46 line 2).  One of the children brought a toy magic wand into the play (<EM>id</EM>).  It fell onto the lap of 
this child, and she later told her parents that the Applicant touched her with his magic wand, "a pink stick,"(<EM>ibid</EM>).  The parents assumed the worse case scenario, 
and called the authorities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In late 1994 and early 1995, the Applicant was again playing with his tenant's child (TR at page 33 line 23 to page 35 line 23).  The mother of this child, a 
single mother with little means of support, had heard that the parents of the child noted above received monies from a Crime Victims Fund (<EM>id</EM>).  She soon 
thereafter went to the authorities and caused two charges to be alleged against the Applicant (<EM>ibid</EM>).  These two charges, and that noted in the prior paragraph, 
were subsequently <STRONG>dismissed with prejudice</STRONG> (GX 4 at pages 7~8).  The Applicant has always espoused his innocence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. and 3.b.  Later, in 1995, the Applicant was maintaining his tenancy with the help of neighborhood teenagers (TR at page 35 line 24 to page 38 line 16, and 
at page 50 lines 10~25).  Three of these teenagers were the grandchildren of a new tenant, who replaced the single mother tenant who caused the false 
allegations to be charged (<EM>id</EM>).  In exchange for their help, he offered the teenagers "some pizza and soda," but they talked the Applicant into providing them 
with a six pack of beer (<EM>ibid</EM>).  One of the teenager's father complained to the authorities; and as a result, the Applicant was cited for Furnishing Alcohol to 
inors (GX 5).  He was fined $150 (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The grandmother of three of the before mentioned teenagers has written a letter in support of the Applicant's request for a security clearance (Applicant's 
Exhibit A).  The Applicant's supervisor testified that the Applicant is both truthful and trustworthy (TR at page 53 line 17 to page 56 line 20).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sexual Behavior</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines J (criminal conduct), D (sexual behavior), and E (personal conduct); which establishes doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability 
to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in 
all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude 
towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant vehemently denies the allegations of sexual misconduct.  I find his denial to be credible, as the charges against him were dismissed with 
prejudice, and his supervisor corroborates that the Applicant is a truthful person.  He was, however, cited for Furnishing Alcohol to Minors, an allegation he 
unequivocally admits.  This isolated incident occurred nearly seven years ago; and as such, is not of present security significance.  Guidelines D, E and J are 
therefore found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his criminal conduct, and his alleged sexual behavior and personal 
conduct.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines D, E and J, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his 
ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines D, E and J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
