<P>Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley issued a decision, dated June 30, 1999, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not considering Applicant's response to the
File of Relevant Material; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 8, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was based
on Criterion F (Financial Considerations).</P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR in which he indicated he did not want a hearing.  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was
prepared.  A copy of the FORM was given to Applicant, who submitted a response dated June 4, 1999.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated June 30, 1999, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not considering Applicant's response to the File of Relevant Material</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the
Administrative Judge did not consider his June 4, 1999 response to the FORM.  In support of this contention, Applicant cites to his June 4,
1999 response  when challenging some of the Judge's factual findings.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant has failed
to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P>

<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states
otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0617 (July 14, 1999) at p. 3.  Apart from that presumption, the Board notes the following: Applicant's
June 4, 1999 response to the FORM is in the case file; the Judge noted in the decision that he would consider Applicant's response to the
FORM; and Applicant's response to the FORM contained documentation of his satisfaction of a debt referred to a collection agency by a
medical center, which the Judge found in Applicant's favor.  Merely because the Judge did not find other portions of Applicant's response to
the FORM to be persuasive does not demonstrate the Judge ignored it.</P>

<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the
Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because: (a) the Judge failed to consider Applicant's
efforts to work with his creditors to resolve his outstanding debts; (b) the Judge erred by finding Applicant had monthly net income of $1411
but did not use that income to repay delinquent debts; (c) the Judge erred by not giving Applicant the full benefit of applicable Financial
Considerations Mitigating Guidelines; and (d) the Judge erred by concluding Applicant did not successfully mitigate the government's case
against him.  Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>(a) Contrary to Applicant's arguments, the Administrative Judge specifically considered Applicant's efforts to deal with his outstanding debts. 
The Judge did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner by distinguishing between (i) debt resolution efforts for which Applicant provided
corroborating documentation and (ii) debt resolution efforts for which Applicant did not provide such documentation.  A Judge is not required
to accept an applicant's statements at face value merely because they are not rebutted by Department Counsel.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0265 (March 17, 1999) at page 4 note 2.  It is reasonable for a Judge to consider the record as a whole and use common sense in evaluating
the absence of corroborating evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0592 (May 4, 1999) at p. 5.  Failure to present documentation in support
of an applicant's claims about financial matters is a factor to be considered by a Judge in evaluating such claims.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.
98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 4.  Accordingly, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to decline to accept
Applicant's undocumented claims that he was negotiating with some of his creditors to resolve certain unsatisfied debts.</P>

<P>Furthermore, some of Applicant's claims concerning his debt resolution efforts were, on their face, based on commitments made by Applicant
to perform various acts in the future.  Promises to take actions in the future, however sincere, are not a substitute for a documented track
record of remedial actions.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 29, 1999) at p. 3.  The possibility that Applicant might achieve
resolution of his outstanding debts at some future date does not constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation in the present.  <EM>See,
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 98-0614 (July 12, 1999) at p. 5.  Given Applicant's overall history of financial problems, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law for the Judge to give little or no weight to Applicant's promises to take actions in the future to satisfy various outstanding
debts.</P>

<P>(b) The Board is not persuaded by Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's finding about the significance of Applicant's monthly
net income.  Applicant's argument is based, in part, on statements that go beyond the record evidence.  Such statements constitute new
evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 29.  Furthermore, the Judge cannot be expected
to consider information outside the record that Applicant could have  presented when he responded to the FORM.  To the extent Applicant's
argument on this point is based on record evidence, it merely reargues the significance of evidence the Judge had the opportunity to consider
and weigh.  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.</P>

<P>(c) Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by not giving him the full benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions
3,<A HREF="99-0012.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 4,<A HREF="99-0012.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="99-0012.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's contention lacks merit.</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Directive, Section F.3.  However, the mere
presence or absence of an Adjudicative Guidelines Disqualifying or Mitigating Condition is not solely dispositive of a case.  Rather, the Judge
must consider applicable Disqualifying or Mitigating Conditions in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0617
(July 14, 1999) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 98-0394 (June 10, 1999) at p. 4.</P>

<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge noted that Applicant's financial problems were mitigated somewhat under Financial Considerations
itigating Condition 3.  However, the Judge concluded Applicant had presented "insufficient explanations as to why he could not have
worked out repayment arrangements with his creditors earlier . . . ."  It was not arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to consider whether
Applicant made timely, reasonable efforts to deal with the financial setbacks that resulted from conditions beyond his control.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 98-0257 (January 22, 1999) at p. 3 ("Even if Applicant's former marriage to a drug abuser were the source of many of her problems,
it did not relieve Applicant of the obligation to address her problems in a responsible and reasonable manner.").</P>

<P>The Board is not persuaded by Applicant's argument that the Administrative Judge was arbitrary and capricious when he did not apply
Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 4.  Applicant's argument relies on the fact that he received financial counseling, but ignores
the Judge's conclusion that Applicant has not yet shown that his financial problems are resolved or under control.  The Judge's conclusion
reflects a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and provides a rational basis for his decision to not apply Financial Considerations
itigating Condition 4.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge also articulated a rational explanation for concluding that Applicant's efforts to resolve his financial problems
warranted little weight under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.  Given the Judge's explanation, it was not arbitrary or
capricious for the Judge to give little weight to Mitigating Condition 6.</P>

<P>(d) Applicant's ability to cite to favorable record evidence does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.  A Judge must consider the record evidence as whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable
evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0435 (September 16, 1999) at p. 3.  In this case, the Judge gave an explanation for his
conclusion that Applicant had failed to successfully mitigating the government's case against him.  The Judge's explanation reflects a
reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant's disagreement with the weight the Judge placed on favorable and unfavorable
evidence is not enough to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 98-0767 (August 18, 1999) at p. 3.</P>

<P>Applicant's argument about the relative seriousness of his financial problems does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge was not required to make a favorable security clearance decision merely because
Applicant did not engage in certain serious kinds of financial misconduct (such as theft, fraud, breach of trust, or incurring financial problems
due to gambling or substance abuse).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments about a
person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  A history of financial problems provides a rational basis for questioning an applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case
No. 96-0544 (May 12, 1997) at pp. 5-6 (discussing security significance of history of financial problems).  The Judge's findings and
conclusions about Applicant's overall history of financial problems provided a rational basis for the Judge's doubts about Applicant's security
suitability.  Given those doubts, the Judge acted properly by resolving them in favor of the national security.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>,
484 U.S. at 531.  </P>
