<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies, which have now been fully satisfied. To a large extent his financial problems coincided with the break up of 
his second marriage, which has now resulted in a divorce, and a period of unemployment caused by the closure of the factory where he had worked for ten 
years. He has credibly explained why he failed to disclose the full extent of his prior financial difficulties in a security clearance application he submitted in 
arch 2001. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by his financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, for financial considerations, and Guideline E, for personal conduct.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR, dated September 5, 2003, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations concerning his 
financial delinquencies, and provided explanations about their then current status. He denied the allegations alleging falsification of the security clearance 
application he submitted in March 2001. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on December 23, 2003. A notice of hearing was issued on January 7, 2004, scheduling the hearing for February 25, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted five documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, 
and admitted into the record without an objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, called one character witness, and submitted eleven documentary exhibits 
that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-11, and admitted into the record without an objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documents in support of his case. Three additional documents were timely received, marked as AE 12-14, and admitted into 
the record without an objection. The transcript was received March 4, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government moved to amend SOR subparagraph 2.d. to allege failure to disclose the debt described in subparagraph 1.g., instead of subparagraph 1.h. The 
motion to amend was granted without an objection.  The government also conceded the debt listed in subparagraph 1.k. was a duplication of the debt listed in 
subparagraph 1.j., and the debts listed in subparagraph 1.r. and 1.s. had been discharged in bankruptcy in July 1998.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 41 years old, married, and has been employed by a defense contractor as an armed security guard since July 1999. He graduated from high school 
in 1980, and worked at several unskilled jobs until he was injured in an automobile accident in 1982. He was disabled and unable to return to work until 1985. 
He drove a truck from 1985 until 1989, at which time he began working in a factory. He continued the factory job until he was laid-off in 1999 when the plant 
he was working in closed down. He remained unemployed for approximately six months, and was then underemployed until he began working full-time at his 
present position in 2002. Applicant's upper-line supervisor testified he is a trustworthy and model employee, and there is no derogatory information contained 
in his personnel record.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was first married in August 1982, and divorced that wife in October 1992. He has no children from that marriage. Applicant remarried in December 
1994, separated from that wife less than a year later, and obtained a divorce from her in September 1999. He has one child from that marriage who is nine years 
old, lives with her mother, and for whom Applicant provides support. Applicant married his present wife in December 1999. He has two stepchildren from this 
marriage, ages fourteen and ten, who live with him and his wife. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial problems began shortly after he married his second wife. She became  pregnant shortly after they were married, and was dissatisfied with 
the two bedroom house they were in the process  of purchasing. Applicant purchased a larger house to keep her happy, and rented the second house to tenants 
who began defaulting on their rent payments. Within the first year of their marriage, Applicant's wife left him, took their daughter with her, and began drawing 
welfare. The state garnished his wages to cover the support provided by the welfare department for his child. Applicant's financial problems were further 
complicated by the need to replace the transmission in his vehicle four times, before he finally gave up and allowed it to be repossessed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on February 19, 1998, listing $67.669.00 in secured and unsecured debt. He received a discharge in 
bankruptcy on July 10, 1998. Additionally, the company holding the note on the rental property foreclosed on the mortgage, and sold the property without any 
deficit being owed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was earning $15.50 per hour until he was laid off in January 1999. He relocated to a different state to be near his present wife, and was unable to find 
work until July 1999, at which time he began working part-time as a security guard making $8.69 per hour. He eventually was hired as a full-time security 
guard and presently earns $14.50 per hour. His and his wife's combined income in 2003 was $89,062.00. They are purchasing the house his wife bought prior to 
their marriage that Applicant values at approximately $65,000.00, and which will be paid off in two years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent accounts following the bankruptcy discharge because of his unemployment and inability to sell the house he 
resided in prior to relocating. The house was eventually subject to a foreclosure, and was disposed of with no deficit being owed. He has now satisfied all 
creditors, is current on his debts, and the only wage garnishment he is subject to is a mandatory garnishment for child support in accord with applicable state 
law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant disclosed his bankruptcy, child support wage garnishment, automobile repossession, and mortgage foreclosure in the security clearance application 
(SF 86) he submitted on March 9, 2001. However, he did not disclose an alleged arrearage in child support payments, and a garnishment entered to collect the 
arrearage. He credibly explained, and offered documentary evidence in corroboration, that there was no arrearage and the action taken by the state welfare 
agency was in error. He also credibly explained he failed to list a debt that was more than 180 days delinquent, because it had been discharged in bankruptcy, 
and a debt that was more than 90 days delinquent through inadvertence.                    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-20084.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Beginning in the early to mid-1990s, and continuing until recently, Applicant experienced marital problems and financial setbacks that caused him to 
experience mortgage foreclosures and automobile repossessions, file bankruptcy and become delinquent on numerous debts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial problems first arose when his wife left him, took their daughter, and began drawing welfare. They were exacerbated by automobile 
breakdowns and his tenants' failure to pay rent. Shortly after he received a bankruptcy discharge, Applicant found himself first unemployed and then 
underemployed. He has now satisfied his creditors, is earning a substantial combined income with his wife, and appears to have regained relative financial 
security. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts </EM>apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the testimony provided by Applicant's character witness, the 
circumstances that caused him to become severely delinquent on various accounts, the actions he took to return his finances to order, the whole person concept, 
the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated this 
security concern. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.  Guideline F is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant disclosed many of his financial problems in the SF 86 he submitted, but also provided 
incorrect answers to several questions. However, I have considered Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying, and the explanations he has 
given. I am convinced Applicant did not intend to deliberately omit or conceal information.  Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
