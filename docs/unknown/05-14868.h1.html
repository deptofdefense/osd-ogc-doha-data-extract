<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 28, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN>On January 19, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, notarized answer, dated February 20, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, electing to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A complete copy of 
the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 16, 2006, was provided to him on June 23, 2006, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Any such submissions were due by July 23, 2006.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant requested additional time, and DOHA granted a delay until September 15, 2006.  Applicant did not 
provide additional materials in response to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on October 12, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 15, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the SOR, adding an additional allegation (SOR &para; 1.k).  The additional allegation is that a Federal IRS tax lien was filed in 
September 2005 against Applicant in the amount of $4,408.00.  A notice of IRS tax lien was previously filed against him in October 2003 in the amount of $13,509.00 (SOR &para; 1.b.).  Department 
Counsel's motion is denied.  Department Counsel has not provided any information about whether the 2005 IRS tax lien of $4,408.00 is included in the 2003 IRS lien notice, or otherwise explained 
how the two IRS tax liens relate to each other.  The documentation showing the $4,408.00 IRS tax lien is admitted, and will be considered in connection with SOR &para; 1.b.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant made some admissions, and denied other allegations in his response to the SOR.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  Under 
Guideline F, Applicant admitted he was aware of and responsible for the bankruptcy in SOR &para; 1.a., but that the debts resulted from his divorce.  For SOR &para; 1.b., he admitted he owed the IRS for 
back taxes and wanted to arrange a settlement and payment plan.  In regard to SOR &para; 1.c., he admitted the debt but contended it was discharged by bankruptcy.   He denied SOR &para;&para; 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 
and 1.j. without elaboration.  He was aware of the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.g. and 1.h., but disputed them.  For SOR &para; 1.i., he admitted the debt, made payments and then settled it.  He denied consuming 
alcohol to excess, as alleged in SOR &para;&para;  2.a., 2.b., and 2.c., but admitted consuming alcohol before an automobile accident (SOR &para;  2.b.), and consuming beer before making an improper lane 
change (SOR &para; 2.c.).  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> employee of a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The same government contractor employed him for the preceding nine years.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Applicant was on active duty in the Navy from July

award from DoD in 1992 and 1994, a letter of appreciation in 2000, and two very positive emails from customers in 2004 and 2005.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  From 1981 to 1985, he attended college, and was awarded a 
Bachelor of Science degree.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married in November 1970; divorced on May 16, 1975;  remarried in February 1977; and divorced on September 28, 1979.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  His third marriage 
occurred on  May 4, 1980; and he was divorced on July 30, 1990. </SPAN> Applicant's fourth marriage was on May 21, 1994; and he was divorced on February 6, 2000.  Applicant has two children, who 
were born on March 13, 1995, and July 16, 1997.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P>

court and was sentenced to 12 months' probation and 40 hours' community service.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  He attended a drug and alcohol awareness program, and a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.

the DUI charge.  Despite the state's inaction against him for the 2004 DUI, and his statement about not being impaired by alcohol, I find there is substantial evidence that he drove while impaired by 
alcohol.  I base this finding primarily on the BAT result of .12.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
E2.2.1 of the Directive: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk 
of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. If the government meets its initial burden, 
applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and 
ultimately to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue applicant's clearance.<A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN> Applicant's failure to pay his debts is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The Directive 
clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations in &para; E2.A6.1.1.  (<EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds</EM>.). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy his outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>history of not meeting financial 
obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  These two disqualifying conditions are established by Applicant's initial failure to meet his financial obligations, 
and inability or unwillingness to satisfy SOR debts &para;&para; 1.a. to 1.f., and 1.j.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He failed to provide any documentation to show what he was doing to dispute or resolve the five debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 
1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.j.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, he provided credible information disputing or showing payment for SOR debts &para;&para; 1.g. to 1.i., and these two disqualifying conditions are not established for these 
three debts. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> (<EM>to rebut, 
explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and </EM>[<EM>applicant</EM>]<EM> has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) and FC MC  E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>). However, these two 
mitigating conditions do not apply because <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">five SOR debts (SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.j.) </SPAN>are recent and not isolated.  These five debts are all currently delinquent and are not being resolved.  </P> 
 
<P>The information Applicant provided about his divorce in 2000 supported consideration of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control 
(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>)).  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. applies to <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his bankruptcy in 2001 (SOR &para; 1.a.), and the 
bankruptcy discharge of the $10,842.00 debt in SOR &para; 1.c.  The dissolution of his marriage and his bankruptcy the next year are closely linked in time and circumstances. </SPAN>However, his financial 
difficulties after the 2001 bankruptcy remain largely unexplained.  There is little evidence to explain why the debts alleged in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.j.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>became or remained delinquent.  
Applicant remained gainfully employed throughout the last six years.   He had more than sufficient time after his 2001 bankruptcy to avoid delinquent debts and thereafter to demonstrate progress 
towards payment of these five delinquent debts. His failure to demonstrate progress towards payment of these five SOR debts reflect an inability or unwillingness to pay or resolve his debts.  FCMC 
E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply to SOR debts <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para;&para; 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.j</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>I considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) and FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant did not receive and is not receiving debt counseling.  FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.4. does not apply to any debts.   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not provided evidence establishing that he acted in good faith with respect to the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.j., and </SPAN>FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.6. does not apply. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline G. Examination of Applicant's  actions  reveals conduct involving </SPAN>e<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">xcessive alcohol consumption.  </SPAN>The Directive clearly expresses the 
government's concern regarding excessive alcohol consumption in provision <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1. (<EM>excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to

<P><A NAME="cp246"></A><A NAME="cp247"></A>I considered <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC  MC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (<EM>the alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM>), AC MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.3.2.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(<EM>t</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>he problem occurred a number of

were two incidents (in 2001 and 2004).  The two incidents constitute a pattern because they are in close temporal proximity to each other.  They are recent.  There is no evidence about reduction of 
factors leading to the incidents, or facts supporting a change in Applicant's life circumstances, counseling or other rehabilitative measures supportive of sobriety.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No mitigating conditions are 
applicable to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the conduct alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.a. to 2.c.</SPAN></P>

</A> 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">provision E2.2.1. As 
noted above, Applicant's failure to make progress resolving five SOR debts, including a debt of over $13,000.00 to the IRS is a serious ongoing, long-term problem.  His history of alcohol abuse 
and unwillingness to maintain sobriety, resulting in judicial intervention, probation for 12 months, a fine, and community service are sufficiently serious to be a security concern. E2.2.1.1.  His 
actions were knowledgeable and voluntary. E2.2.1.2.<SUP></SUP>  He is 54 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The likelihood of recurrence cannot yet be determined 
because insufficient time has passed since the last alcohol-related incident and the corroborating evidence of a change is sparse. E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His 36 years of honorable service to DoD, including his 
two AEGIS awards and laudatory comments about his job performance, as well as the absence of evidence of prior security violations, show he is a DoD asset, highlight the possibility of 
rehabilitation, and weigh against security concerns.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has 
not </SPAN>mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations and alcohol consumption.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful consideration of the whole person factors"<SUP><A HREF="05-14868.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of 
my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
