<P>On August 28, 2006,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 
1992, as amended. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and Guideline E, 
Personal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>October 7, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued 
on November 14, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>December 4, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits 
(Gov. Ex.) 1-5.  The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted 11 exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-K, 
which were admitted without objection.</SPAN> The record was kept open until December 18, 2006,  for the submission of additional documents. An extension was granted. Applicant timely submitted two 
additional documents that were marked as AE L and AE M and admitted without objection.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 12, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, and 3.e.  He denies the allegations in &para;&para; 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 2.d, 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d. Applicant's 
admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 47 years old and is employed as a lead equipment operator with a Department of Defense contractor.  He has been employed with the defense contractor since November 2003.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He is a 
high school graduate.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He is divorced and has two children, a daughter, age 20, and a son, age 15.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 22, 1994, Applicant was charged with knowingly possessing a dangerous drug, methamphetamine, a class IV felony.  On October 21, 1994, he pled guilty to attempted possession of a 
dangerous drug, methamphetamine, a class IV felony.  On November 1, 1994, he was sentenced to three years supervised probation and 200 hours community service.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant had  approximately 
one quarter gram of methamphetamine on his person at the time of the arrest.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 30, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with the offense of criminal damage. He is not quite certain but thinks this may have involved an incident where he pulled the phone cord out 
of the wall in his home.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  On November 18, 1994, he was found guilty.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 28, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct. He got into an argument with his 17 year old step-daughter who was making a lot of noise at around 3 
am. He claims he did not hit her but was trying to calm her down. During this incident, his step-daughter bit and stabbed him.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> On November 8, 2000, he pled guilty to Disorderly Conduct and 
received a deferred sentence.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 18, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> In response to question 37. Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgments, which reads "In the last 7 years, have you had any 
judgments against you that have not been paid?" he answered "No."  He did not list the $25,000 judgment obtained against him in October 2002.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> In response to question 38. Your Financial 
Delinquencies - 180 Days, which reads, "In the last 7 years have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" he answered "No."  In response to question 39. Your Financial Delinquencies - 
90 days, which reads, "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?," he answered "No."  He did not list any of his delinquent debts in response to questions 38 and 39.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No" in response to question 26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses, which reads, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation 
was alcohol or drug related.) For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this 
requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>He did not list his August 28, 2000, charge for assault and disorderly conduct.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He could not explain why he did not list this offense in response to the question. He remembered the arrest and the 
event leading to the arrest.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  I find Applicant deliberately failed to list his August 2000 arrest for assault and disorderly conduct in response to question 26. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's background investigation revealed eleven delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $48,819.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The accounts included a delinquent collection account for $120 (SOR &para;

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denies most of the accounts listed in the SOR because he claims that he does not recognize the account.  He divorced his second wife in 2000, and states that half of the marital debts were 
her responsibility. She filed for bankruptcy shortly after the divorce.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> He has not formally disputed any of the delinquent debts on his credit report that he denies are his.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2006, Applicant was interviewed during his background investigation by a Special Agent with the Office of Personnel Management.  The Special Agent asked Applicant about his arrest 
record and his financial issues. Specifically, he asked why he did not list the 2000 arrest for assault and disorderly conduct and why he did not list his delinquent judgment and delinquent debts.  
Applicant did not explain why he left off the 2000 arrest.  Pertaining to the financial issues, Applicant claims he gave "an incomplete answer but not an incorrect answer" but did not elaborate 
further.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the interview, the Special Agent asked Applicant to sign a release form for financial-related documents.  The purpose of the release form was to verify that the adverse information on the 
credit report was accurate. The Special Agent told Applicant that signing the release form was voluntary. Applicant refused stating that his financial issues were his to address and there was no need 
for Defense Investigative Services to get involved. The interview ended at that point.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

during the investigation.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  He refused to the sign the consent form for release of his financial information because he did not think the government needed to dig any deeper.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and discussed 
in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge

nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="06-13462.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> <BR>

Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F, Financial Considerations; 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Financial</STRONG> <STRONG>Considerations  </STRONG> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant has approximately $48,819 in delinquent debt. Under Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1: (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC 3 
E2.A6.1.2.3: (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case. The majority of the debt consists of a $25,000 judgment issued against Applicant in October 2002.  He paid three 
of his delinquent accounts (SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d) but is unable to repay his remaining debts based on his current income and child support obligations.</P> 
 
<P>The security concern under Guideline F can be mitigated.  I find Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1: (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply. Although 
Applicant has paid the debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, all other debts remain unpaid. Therefore, I conclude the behavior is recent. Based on his numerous debts,  I cannot apply FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.2: (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>).</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3: (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies, in part, because Applicant has encountered financial difficulty as a result of his two divorces.  However, his most recent divorce occurred in 2000. He has had 
six years to work on resolving his financial difficulties. For these reasons, I give little weight to the application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4: (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) is not applicable 
because Applicant has not received financial counseling. Although he has paid off three of the debts, the other debts remain outstanding.  While Applicant should be commended for starting to work 
on his financial delinquencies, his financial issues are unlikely to be resolved or under control in the near future.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6: (<EM>The individual initiated a good-effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) does not apply because the majority of his delinquent debts remain unresolved.  Based on his current budget, he is unable to resolve his delinquent accounts. </P> 
 
<P>A security concern remains under Guideline F. It is too early to conclude that Applicant's financial situation is completely under control.  I find against him under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of criminal conduct.  He has been arrested and charged with criminal offenses on three occasions in the past. In 1994, he was arrested on two occasions. He was convicted for 
a drug offense and found guilty of a criminal damage charge. In 2000, he was convicted of disorderly conduct after a domestic argument with his step-daughter.  His most recent criminal conduct was 
his intentional failure to list his judgment, delinquent debts, and his 2000 criminal offense on his security clearance application. His deliberate omissions violated Title 18 United States Code &sect; 1001. 
The record supports the application of Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>I find none of the mitigating conditions apply under criminal conduct.  While I acknowledge that Applicant has not been arrested or charged with a crime since the last incident in 2000, the deliberate 
falsifications on his May 18, 2005, security clearance application is considered recent criminal behavior. Therefore, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1: (<EM>The criminal 
behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply.  CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2: (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) does not apply since he has a history of criminal offenses. I cannot apply CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6: 
(<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) since it is too soon to conclude that Applicant has been rehabilitated based on his recent falsification. I find against Applicant under Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in 
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, the record evidence establishes that Applicant deliberately falsified his responses to questions 37, 38, 39, and 26 on his security clearance application dated May 18, 2005.  He deliberately 
omitted his $25,000 judgment in response to question 37.  He deliberately omitted his delinquent debts in response to questions 38 and 39.  He admits that he was aware that he had delinquent debts 
but did not list them because he assumed the government would obtain his credit report anyway.  This is not a sufficient justification for failing to list his delinquent debts on his security clearance 
application. He also failed to explain why he did not list his August 2000 arrest for Assault and Disorderly Conduct in response to question 26.  His deliberate falsifications<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> supports the application of 
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).</EM>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), only PC MC  E2.A5.1.3.3: (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted 
with the facts) </EM>has the potential to apply to the facts of this case. I find that it does not apply.  The OPM Special Agent testified that he raised the issues regarding Applicant's omission of his 
delinquent debts, 2002 judgment, and his 2000 criminal offense on his security clearance application. Applicant did not fully disclose the omitted information prior to being confronted about it. As 
such PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 does not apply. I find against Applicant with respect to personal conduct SOR &para;&para; 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I find for Applicant with respect to SOR &para;3.e pertaining to his refusal to sign a requested financial release to the OPM Agent. The Agent testified that he advised Applicant that his willingness to sign 
a release was voluntary. Since he was given a choice in the matter, I cannot hold his refusal to sign a financial release against Applicant. The credit report already obtained by the government raised 
sufficient financial considerations concerns. I find for Applicant with respect to personal conduct SOR &para; 1.e. However, Applicant did not mitigate the personal conduct security concerns pertaining to 
the falsification of his security clearance application.  I find against Applicant under Guideline E. </P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's life to 
make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" 
concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration 
all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>In reaching my decision, I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.  I 
acknowledge that Applicant is highly thought of by his superiors and co-workers. However, an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
security implications. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines F, J, and E based on his financial history, criminal record, and his deliberate falsification of his security 
clearance application. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.<STRONG></STRONG></P>
